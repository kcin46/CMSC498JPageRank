It's time for this person to understand that fun is only for children, and if they want fun things in their life they should have them.","I know you're being sarcastic, but for my 25 birthday my whole family showed up and it was a huge supper and party. My aunt said I had to wash the dishes, no dishwasher. It's an understanding in my family that the birthday person doesn't have to do much on their day. When I said, ok but that's weird making the birthday girl do the dishes. Can I have a helper? She replied with, no you should get used to your birthdays becoming more and more disappointing. Just wait until you have kids, it will be about them all the time, even on your birthday. \nI was so taken aback. Aren't birthdays to be special? I don't want to sound like a little spoiled kid, but I was upset that she would think birthdays become less and less important. ","It's true. Unless it's say 40th, 50th, 60th. Otherwise life is busy enough already, to have a big celebration for a 34th or 37th etc. yeah I'm all for it any excuse for a get together... though the effort for big suppers and parties are saved for younger kids as time goes on.
