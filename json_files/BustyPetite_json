The water is in fact not colorless; even pure water is not colorless, but has a slight blue tint to it, best seen when looking through a long column of water. The blueness in water is not caused by the scattering of light, which is responsible for the sky being blue. Rather, water blueness comes from the water molecules absorbing the red end of the spectrum of visible light. To be even more detailed, the absorption of light in water is due to the way the atoms vibrate and absorb different wavelengths of light.

It works well, but damn is it big(and probable expensive). ","Idk, I counted about 10 seconds from start of peeling to pieces falling off. That's 6 apples per minute. 360 apples per hour. If you're paying a worker 10 dollars per hour to peel and core and slice 3 apples per minute (extremely optimistic estimate, although im making shit up here) you're paying ~5.5 cents per apple. If the machine costs 750 dollars  and 15 cents per hour to run, it basically pays for itself after 40,000 apples (by my drunk math that I was unable to recount how i arrived at the conclusion to), or 120 hours of use. Of course the amount you're profiting off of the cored and peeled apples affects this too but excluding that I'm fairly confident that my math is wrong. If anyone wants to correct me go ahead, but until then I'm pretty sure this machine is a great investment. Assuming the machine needs a person feeding it apples this starts to fall apart but i'm sure an apple-feeding machine exists for some other purpase already that we can use to complicate this equation even more","Your calculation is wrong. It may take roughly 10-12 seconds to peel a single apple, but the machine is doing 3 apples in parallel. I counted 4 seconds between him putting each apple on(which is where I got 12 sec from, 3*4). That means it can do 15 apples per min, much faster than a person. It is surely cost effective, it is just is big as hell too. ","i mean what kkind of use do you have for an industrial (can we pump more power into it to speed it up? i'm sure you could increase the motor speed and potentially profit per time spent running with a better motor) apple peeling/coring machine where the space it occupies is going to be a limiting concern? im not making this argument from a household perspective, unless someone's mom is trying to peel the next year woht of apples for them in a single night, in which case the space issue is likely a nonfactor again regardless. if i owned a business that needed apples cored and peeled and could sell them faster than my employees could peel them i would definitely be investing in this. who knows","Yah, it would have to be an extreme need. But if the business needed 900 apples peeled an hour, this would do it. I feel like it would take 5-10 workers to do it by hand.  ","Nah, the machine is a gimmick, no kitchen would buy this.  it's largely automated but importantly it still needs a PERSON to load the apples. You're not saving on labour.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj2I3TlqoDY\n\nBack in the good old days I'd use a machine like this to peel my apples.  I'd do a box of apples a day for various deserts but mostly plain pies, cobblers and danishes, with a portion set aside for ice cream or other desert combos. I'm just guessing here, my memory is foggy going back that far, but I think it was about 75 apples a box, and I'd finish that in about 5-7 minutes.  After you're done all that I'd end up with an extra step where i'd go over them with a knife, sometimes rough, sometimes precise, depending on whatever needs were.  that would only take an extra 1-2 minutes.\n\nthat's probably between 7 and 9 apples a minute.  At that rate I couldn't really go more than 10 minutes but it seems about right to my recollection.  The tool I used probably cost about $40, Canadian.  They tend to last if you care for them too.\n\nedit: reviewing that video the person went really really slow and was set up w/ mip all wrong.  I got really good at using it and you kind of settle into a quick rhythm, there's even a little trick kind of when you slide the screw back with the right speed and finesse and the core flies off in the same direction more or less where you set your bin up to collect the peels.  Of course, every now and then you get a ripe bit that just won't co-operate but i bet that kind of thing would muck up the OP's machine too.","how hard would it be to repurpose an existing machine and modify it slightly to be able to load the machines up. If you had 100 of these machines and 3 or 4 people supervising an automated system that would load these apples into a machine (we're assuming that you already have people loading the apples for the machine's human counterpart to begin with) i can easily see the machines being more efficient. How many apples can a \"professional\" corer/peeler do per hour, and with 100% efficiency (no breaks, no slowing down as the day moves on, etc)?\n\n\nAlso, no offense, but i do not believe for a moment that any human is capable of *peeling* and *coring* and *slicing* 75 apples in 5 minutes. That's the most ludicrous thing I've heard in my life. That's beyond steph curry of apples territory. Beyond michael jordan. Even anything close to that. I will personally pay for someone's box of apples three times over if they can show me an unedited video of them coring and peeling and slicing 75 apples of uniform perfect quality and equal slice sizes (8 slices per apple). You can't fucking produce that video. It's fucking inhuman. The guy in the video spent more than 10 seconds peeling the apple alone. You triple that speed and you still barely have 5 seconds to cut and core the apple and start the next one. And you're absolutely sacrificing quality at that point. Show me the videwo","I don't have a video of my regular successes from that long ago, nobody had cameras on their phone like now then.  You don't core the apple, the machine does it.  The guy in the link I posted showed the function, but not the capability. You don't sac quality, the machine cuts it to uniform width!  I might only have to worry about clean slices on the apple-slinky for like 10% that would be used as sides for icecream etc, the rest of it would go inside pies or whatever and could be rough chopped.  You don't wanna believe it, i'm not gonna convince you, sorry. This was also only for 10 minutes sprint, not 8 hours a day like it was a shift.","Its easly 15 apples a min, count the seconds between each apple he puts on. Its about 4 sec. 60/4=15.
