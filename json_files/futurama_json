","You're probably right, 99% of the time nothing bad would happen. However, that 1% is you either killing that person or crippling them for life.\n\nThe chance is small, but the risk is still too high.","[deleted]","From the link you gave, risk = hazard * likelihood/dose\n\nYou've given risk the wrong definition, cos its not just the likelihood. The hazard also comes into play, so you can have a low likelihood, and a major hazard and still have a high risk. \n\nSo /u/Fudgms is still technically correct as the risk is still high because the consequence (hazard) is extreme even if the chance of it happening might be low (although I doubt its that low)","Seconded.

It's never pretty, it was never worth the joke, it never cheers anyone up because \"all the other times it was safe\".

","There was a lot of solid futurology in the details as well, though unfortunately that's pretty niche.","I demand those in charge to immediately make this happen. In fact it is unacceptable the filming hasn't started yet. Cinema is a dead medium, no space for storytelling - this project has to be serialized and with that helmet Dredd has great staying power. Urban could be in these episodes for decades.\n\nI am Dutch. I was in San Francisco, just 100 meters off Turk Street in the Tenderloin in 2012, visiting for a few weeks. I was feral, high on several types of stimulants (modafinil, ritalin) and hypercharged. The days were sweltering hot, and I was just in transition, on Progynova and in a haze of adventurous spirit. I visit the Singularity University, Google Campus, Land's end, Chinatown, the whole lot. Then I noticed the premiere of Dredd in the cinema. So I went, late in the evening.\n\nI got kinda deep in the movie. *I forgot I was in the US during te movie*. So halfway the movie I was asking myself, \"where did I park my bike\" and I was thinking about getting some Showarma before going home. The movie blew me away, it was amazing. Then at 0100 at night I walked out of the cinema, out of full DREDD immersion and in to the sprawling hellish Dystopia that SanFran has become, hearing crazy homeless people howl from the tenderloin. *That was some surreal trip*.

Hope it's Netflix because I forget about Amazon Prime.","Shut up and take my money!","It's sad that Dredd fell under most people's radars. Even my friend who is the biggest 200AD and Dredd fan didn't see it at the cinema and I took me to show him a couple of scenes before he watched it. And then he regretted not seeing it sooner. I don't know if it was just bad marketing or what, but this has been the case with so many people. Dredd is a fantastic film and deserves so much more respect and recognition than it got.

Interestingly, written at a highly transitional time for every single band member.  Nicks and Buckingham were in an extremely turbulent relationship which was coming to an end, John and Christine McVie had divorced and were barely speaking, and Fleetwood had just learned that his wife had been having an affair (to divorce soon afterwards).  I think it was the personal upheaval that caused them to put so much of themselves into each song.  Phenomenal album from start to finish.","if you listen to Go Your Own Way, its about the turbulent relationship that Nicks and Buckingham had.\n ","If I recall correctly Nicks began to hate Buckingham for the line\n\n\"Packing up, shacking up is all you wanna do\"\n\nHere's the exert from Wikipedia, it tells so much about the band at that time:\n\n\"Stevie Nicks asked Buckingham to remove the lyrics \"Packing up, shacking up is all you wanna do\", but Buckingham refused. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Nicks gave her thoughts on the matter. \"I very much resented him telling the world that 'packing up, shacking up' with different men was all I wanted to do. He knew it wasn't true. It was just an angry thing that he said. Every time those words would come onstage, I wanted to go over and kill him. He knew it, so he really pushed my buttons through that. It was like, 'I'll make you suffer for leaving me.' And I did.\"","The first three albums that ushered in the Buckingham Nicks Era of Fleetwood Mac were all truly astonishing.  Of those, Tusk is the one that really captures what I love most of this incarnation.  As far as \"The Chain\" goes, there is an incredible demo of this that has a slow instrumental build; highly recommended.","Holy shit, yes! Everyone likes to put Tusk down but I think it is truly some of their best songwriting especially for Stevie (even though the album was Lindsey's baby).","Big shout out for The Ledge, mainly because of its bonkers production: http://youtu.be/DuQFnVKrHuY\n\n","My 4 year old knows Tusk by the first bar and runs to the speaker! ","I absolutely agree.  Engineering and production feats aside, of all those period albums, Tusk still sounds new.  This probably has to do with its post-punk/ new wave edge paired with their signature song craft.  Who knows, but it speaks to me on an entirely different level.  I only hope these will get the Steve Hoffman Half-Mastered treatment soon.","that sounds amazing, you got a link?","https://youtu.be/CEIEFdNg7ZA","It's an album all about people cheating on each other.

I got to go to their show when they came to Phoenix a couple of years ago and Christine had rejoined their tour.

","Lol I agree though. Never Going Back Again is one of the greatest pop songs of all time","That is by far my favorite Fleetwood Mac song","Who the hell is picking I Don't Want to Know?\n\nIt's a fine song and all, but it's a big step down from the others.","I love it! Not only is it an essential piece in the album (something up-beat in the end of the album) but it's also a simple rock-song whose rhythm I love.\n\nSure it's a big step downwards lyrically but I think it makes up for it with it's composition.","Yeah that's all good, but...favorite?","Favorite is a bit of a strong word, but 'I Don't' was the song that made me listen to Rumours, so for me it's special at the least.","I don't agree about that particular song, but I understand where you're coming from.","You spelled Second Hand News wrong.","Doesn't mean it has to be his favorite. Though. ","Silver Springs would've been the best song on the album if it hadn't been left off in my opinion. The Chain is tops for me otherwise. ","Gypsy and Big Love are pretty good too","Dreams was almost cut ","Those 3 voices came together so well in this song.","Tango in the night was a fantastic concert, I saw them in Detroit in the late 80's.

I did the same things by with my Joshua Tree album in the 80s lol","I was born in 77 and this my favorite album of all time.  I heard it in the womb, when I was a child, through adolescence and into adulthood.  I still listen to it regularly.  The Chain is my favorite song, but the whole album is perfection.","Heard this song watching The Americans the other day, they played it during a snatch and grab op, a lot of visceral emotion occurred in that scene, it was all so excellent.","The Americans also did a particularly good job with Fleetwood Mac's \"Tusk\" in the pilot episode.","That scene combined with that music is what hooked me on The Americans","The Chain and Tainted Love scenes are two of my favourites in The Americans. ","Their live performances of this song are usually better than the album version, imo. Like on the opening of 'The Dance'. Needs good headphones with some decent  bass to get full effect.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/lpVCL00fPAc","The Dance is how I first got into Fleetwood Mac years ago after searching through all of my mom's CDs. I loved it so much I bought the DVD. It's such an amazing live performance.","Me too! I basically grew up on the live album. My parents had that on CD, but most of the others were on records and i wasn't allowed to use the record player as a kid. Listened to The Dance so much that I prefer the live versions of most of the songs now. The live version of this song might be my favorite from Fleetwood Mac altogether. ","How the hell is that audience sitting down during this performance. I'd be standing ON my seat. ","I was a teenager when The Dance first aired, I think on VH1, and it was the year I'd first learned to play guitar. I was into mostly metal and industrial at the time, but had an ear for classic rock too, so I'd heard of Fleetwood Mac but never really listened to them.\n\nI watched this and I was hooked from the intro of The Chain all the way through the end. I remember seeing this and Big Love later on in the show and thinking, \"How the hell does he do that?\" I learned about Travis picking and practiced for years until I could finally nail both of those songs. This live show and album completely changed my personal playing style as a musician, and definitely hooked me into a more eclectic musical fandom where I was willing to draw inspiration from anything.\n\nThanks for posting this! Lindsey will forever make my list as one of the greatest guitarists of all-time, and most definitely in the top of the list of most underrated guitarists of all time.\n\n[Big Love, from The Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZp76M4NGc)","The bass solo is amazing!","John in such an under appreciated genius.

","\"The Dance\" is one of the best live albums of all time.  \n\nI grew up on that album, many hours riding with my parents absolutely SCREAMING along to [Tusk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrRVW-p8SJ8).  I can't even imagine how badass it must have been in person to see Mick Fleetwood come back out on stage and start banging that shit out.\n\nEdit: [This was what they played next in case anyone was wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgwRYjDhK_E)\n\nAlso amazing: [From their 2003 show in Boston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dff2XCh3Ass)  - Solidified Lindsey Buckingham as one of the most badass dudes alive IMO.

I believe Stevie described the concert as, \"As magic as it gets...it was.\" I tend to agree.  That whole performance is amazing.  ","They're both always amazing live as is Silver Springs (but especially on The Dance). Landslide is going to be my father-daughter dance song for my wedding in July. Had to incorporate The Mac in there somehow!! :)","If you are too cool for Fleetwood Mac, you might just be too cool.","Saw them in Perth last year whilst it was pouring down rain, was fantastic, thoroughly enjoyed it.","This has always been my favorite song. I heard it for the first time while camping with a bunch of hooligans. Great introduction to music.","This one is great, but my favorites are Never Going Back Again and Gold Dust Woman.

My favorite is definitely the version off The Dance, though. Actually, The Dance is probably my absolute favorite Fleetwood Mac album ever.   \n\nMy best friend and I used to listen to it constantly. Her wedding song was actually Big Love (the guitar work on that song is nothing short of incredible). I remember that her parents used to make fun of us constantly because it was more their generation’s music than ours.  ","I feel like posting any song off of Rumours in this subreddit is like cheating haha ","Not sure if someone has already mentioned this but for those of you who love the Rumours album and this song in particular, check out the super deluxe album release and the demo version of The Chain. It's much different--only Stevie; acoustic. The riff in what we now know as The Chain is featured in a song that Christine sang, called Keep Me There. ","That bass line tho ","I cannot stop listening to this song! Plus im a huge fan of 80's music, classic rock, 80's pop, generally any 80's music especially Fleetwood Mac!","It's amazing that this album came out in 77, at that!  Rumours was so ahead of its time for sure.  ","Fleetwood Mac has been my favorite band since I was 15 years old (now 28) and I was so amazingly fortunate to get to see them live about 3 years ago. Gah! They're just so amazing. I still enjoy the music they're putting out more recently but nothing compares to Rumours. It's an untouchable album imo.","I've been a fan since I was about 15, too, though I'm a few years older than you (wocka wocka). I often joke that my memorabilia collection is my kids' college fund, but it's a joke because I can't see myself selling anything (I specialize in artwork/photography and records - I've even got all the old bootleg albums from the 70s). I've seen Stevie solo 5 times, Lindsey solo once, and the Mac as a whole twice. Perfection every time. I even got Lindsey to sign my Tusk lithograph - next to Stevie's Rhiannon painting, it is my most prized piece.","I've collected all of their LPs (and some before Lindsey, Stevie, and Christine joined) and a few of the their old posters but besides that I only have current concert/fan shirts. I am completely blessed to have such a sweet fiance who got me Fleetwood Mac tickets for our first Christmas together 3 years ago (which he always says he set the bar too high lol) and it was literally one of the highlights of my life. As soon as they started to perform I immediately broke into tears because I thought I'd never get the chance to see them. Of course, Christine wasn't with them at that concert and she rejoined shortly after we saw them (which is a bummer since Songbird is one of my favorite songs) but it was still amazing and they went for around 3 1/2 hours!!","\"Oh Well\" is the only Fleetwood Mac song I ever liked. That bassline was fucking sick. The rest of their music reminds me of all the other soft rock they played at my orthodontist's office in the early '90s. ","That's because that was a completely different band. The original line up, fronted by Peter Green, with Danny Kirwan joining later, was outselling both the Stones and The Beatles. Check out \"Rattlesnake Shake\", and \"The Green Manalishi\"  from *Live in Boston* to listen to them in their prime. ","\"Man of the world\" is also absolutely sickening song","I can't believe that slipped my mind, it's one of my favourites!","The night is so black that the darkness cooks","**DUH DE DUH DE DUH, DUH DUH**","That makes a lot of sense. I never understood why a band capable of such awesomeness wiild spend decades being not very awesome. Thanks for the info.","No problem! \n\nThe reason for the change in line up was essentially Green leaving for disputed reasons, Jeremy Spencer running off to join a cult (Children of God in LA I believe), and Kirwan becoming an alcoholic and uncooperative. There was a period that straddled the pop and the blues iterations which featured Bob Welch and Weston also.","The reason for the change in line up was essentially Green leaving for disputed reasons.......\n\nThis makes me so sad, I believe if Green hadn't have took that trip he'd have been recognised as one of the best, some have all the technique but no emotion, the opening of \"need your love so bad\" gets me everytime, same  as \"I loved another woman\"\n\n\"He's the only one who gave me the cold sweats\" ","Fleetwood Mac was much better before they got the chicks. Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.","I like to just think of them as two separate, awesome groups that shared a common name.  Kinda the opposite of Jefferson Airplane/Starship","For the life of me, I will never understand how this sub works.","That's okay. You'll be okay.","Why have I never heard of this band? I've been listening to my local classic rock radio station for years and never once heard of them. \n\nPeople keep mentioning *Rhiannon*.
