Even In a crosswind, the front and rear landing gear should touch as simultaneously as possible for the most control on the ground. Now, often landing in a cross wind, you often land tilted so one side (left or right depending on direction of wind) will touch the ground before the other but front and back should be the time. \n\nTldr: this is actually not how you're suppose to land in a crosswind.

I've seen some movies that came out before I was born, but not many. That's especially true of genres like scifi, which tends not to age as well.

It's probably that my opinion on that has been affected by the rise of CGI. IME, most CGI has a shelf life of ~10-15 years before it starts to look dated and cheesy. Old-school matte paintings and models can hold up surprisingly well if they're done right. But yeah, 2001:ASO is fucking great.

I got in an argument with my \"friends\" today because they tried to say he wasn't the greatest artist of all time. Don't they realize that Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 ‚Äì April 21, 2016) was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer and actor. He was a musical innovator and known for his eclectic work, flamboyant stage presence, and wide vocal range. His music integrates a wide variety of styles, including funk, rock, R&amp;B, soul, psychedelia, and pop. He has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time.[1] He won seven Grammy Awards,[2] a Golden Globe Award,[3] and an Academy Award.[4] He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the first year of his eligibility.[5] Rolling Stone ranked Prince at number 27 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[6]\n\nPrince was born in Minneapolis and developed an interest in music as a young child. He secured a recording contract with Warner Bros at the age of 18, and released his album For You in 1978. His 1979 album Prince went platinum due to the success of the singles \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\". His next three records‚ÄîDirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982)‚Äîcontinued his success, showcasing Prince's trademark of prominently sexual lyrics and blending of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released Purple Rain, which served as the soundtrack to his film debut of the same name and was met with widespread acclaim. After releasing the albums Around the World in a Day (1985) and Parade (1986), The Revolution disbanded and Prince released the critically acclaimed double album Sign o' the Times (1987) as a solo artist. He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Prince became embroiled in a contractual battle with Warner Bros. In 1993, he changed his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol Prince logo.svg, also known as the \"Love Symbol\", and soon began releasing new albums at a faster pace to remove himself from contractual obligations to Warner Bros.; he released five records between 1994 and 1996 before signing with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as \"Prince\" again. He released 15 albums after that; his final album, HITnRUN Phase Two, was first released exclusively on the Tidal streaming service on December 11, 2015.[7] On April 21, 2016, he died at his Paisley Park recording studio and home in Chanhassen, Minnesota following hospitalization for flu-like symptoms the previous week.[8]","Wow u must hav been his big est fan!

We were trying all the free samples to determine the quality of the product. They were all generally good execpt for one. It was some milk that an old dutch man was selling, but it was different than \"normal\" milk. It tasted so good and I was so curious to know why. At his stand he had signs advertising his product. We bought a gallon of the sweet sweet milk and went home. The next day we come back, we get there an hour early to beat the afternoon rush. This time we see cheese and yogurt and icecream. He is a dairy man who sells dairy products, pretty typical but omething was different about these. Every product he had was super sweet and yummy in my tummy. I was craving it more and more each time. We approached him at his stand and asked him what his secret was. Where his cows genetically modified? Were they fed something special? I had no idea. He wouldn't tell us what it was. I was getting angry. I had to know why it was so yummy. I was starting to geet impaitent and irrational. I was yelling at him at this point, yet he refused to tell. He wouldn't budge. It was very evident that something was not correct. I was suffering from dairy withdrawls. I was going insane and I needed more. Me and my mom decided to follow him home after the farmers market was over. That was the last possible chance to get more of his product, and we needed more. We got in our car and waited for him to leave. Once he took down his stand and put it in his van he was ready to head out. He started driving and we began to follow him. We were following him for a good 30 minutes then we ended up on the highway. It was clear he was no local, probably a traveling merchant selling his product, We were approaching the border and about to leave colorado. He wasn't taking any stops, driving for hours upon hours. After multiple days of nonstop driving, I found myself in Illinois, chicago to be exact. I continued following the car untill we were approching the base of a secluded hill. As we drove up it, I noticed that we were leaving the city. There was suddenly less of society and more of nothingness. After driving for miles into an exluded area there was a warehouse building. We were trailing pretty far behind the man so he didn't see us following him. He parked his car  and then went into the warehouse. We parked in the more wooded area and then got close to the building. There is a window close to us so I creep over too it and crouch beneath it. I slowly peep my head up and see the horrors as to what lies within the building. There is around eight hundred female dogs chained to posts. I start to panic. Was I drinking dog milk? Is that why it was so good? No, it cant be. i walk over to the door where the man entered the premises. I open the door and go in. There is a huge open space where the dogs are being kept, and then office like rooms on the other side of the warehouse. I run accross the building towards the offices having my hands cupped around my ears to stop myself from hearing the distressed whines of the dogs. Once I get to the office my nightmares become a reality. I see none other than Henry Vincenzo Ferolie fucking a dog. I throw up in disgust and then I see the old man suddenly appear out of nowhere. \"Now you know my secret,\" he says in a low monotone voice. I fall to the ground, clutching my stoumach. \"Henry Ferolie hand fucks every dog to make sure they're prime for the milking,\" he utters from behind me as I feel myself slowly dying. I hear a door open and Its none other than the man himself. Henry. He stands tall looming over my crippled body. \"Its your turn now,\" he says \"Its time for the consumer to be the consumed.\" I feel my clothes disengrating off my body and my tailbone extending.

One I can really get behind, you know? Fresh off the pile. Not like one of those old, stale memes. You know, I was browsing my facebook the other day, just kind of scrolling down my wall in a fit of self-hatred, looking at all the normie memes when it hit me. I was at the cross-section of stale pepes and a bad luck brian when I realized that, well... these memes weren't doing it for me anymore. I hopped on over to 9gag. Kanjiklubs and One-Does-Not-Simply's passed through my field of view. I got a small buzz, but it wasn't enough. Nothing could compare to that first high of memes that I got so long ago. I went to tumblr next. Undertale memes. Undertale memes out the ass. I never even finished that game. Then I went to iFunny. Ha ha, just kidding - nobody goes to fucking iFunny. My next stop was reddit. I tried to browse the memes, but the front page was taken over by Donald Trump memes and Bernie Sanders phonebank posts. I tell you what, this election would be an amazing one if reddit upvotes were counted instead of actual votes. Nevertheless, my meme-high couldn't be sated. As a last resort, I went to the source. The place where memes are incubated, grown, and thrown out. The true hivemind of memesters. I ventured into 4chan. It still wasn't enough. I had given up hope. I could never get that first meme-high again. I put my limited edition Japan-imported katana to my belly, prepared to commit sudoku - and that was when I saw it. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a meme. It was this meme. I opened the image, and was hit by a wave of feeling that I hadn't felt in years. An experience that I hadn't had since my very first rage comic back in the fifth grade. As the ecstasy wafted over my pitiful form, I came with the force of a thousand suns. I could feel my body ascending to a higher plane of existence. My existence on this mortal coil was completed.

Legislation across the world prohibit child labour.[4][5] These laws do not consider all work by children as child labour; exceptions include work by child artists, family duties, supervised training, certain categories of work such as those by Amish children, some forms of child work common among indigenous American children, and others.[6][7][8]\n\nChild labour has existed to varying extents, through most of history. Before 1940, numerous children aged 5‚Äì14 worked in Europe, the United States and various colonies of European powers. These children mainly worked in agriculture, home-based assembly operations, factories, mining and in services such as newsies. Some worked night shifts lasting 12 hours. With the rise of household income, availability of schools and passage of child labour laws, the incidence rates of child labour fell.[9][10][11]\n\nIn developing countries, with high poverty and poor schooling opportunities, child labour is still prevalent. In 2010, sub-saharan Africa had the highest incidence rates of child labour, with several African nations witnessing over 50 percent of children aged 5‚Äì14 working.[12] Worldwide agriculture is the largest employer of child labour.[13] Vast majority of child labour is found in rural settings and informal urban economy; children are predominantly employed by their parents, rather than factories.[14] Poverty and lack of schools are considered as the primary cause of child labour.[15]\n\nGlobally the incidence of child labour decreased from 25% to 10% between 1960 and 2003, according to the World Bank.[16] Nevertheless, the total number of child labourers remains high, with UNICEF and ILO acknowledging an estimated 168 million children aged 5‚Äì17 worldwide, were involved in child labour in 2013.","TIL there is a website dedicated to providing information about all of the things that existed in the world in which Prince lived.","Carefully insert the bulb 1/2 to 1 inch into your baby's rectum.\nHold the bulb and your baby still for three minutes.\nDon't let go of the thermometer while it's inside your baby.

Unlike his parents, though, he decided to have just one child- he saw both how much his parents struggled and how little affection they showed with such massive time constraints. Supporting that many children is no simple task, and comes with sacrifice. The six of them returned the favor later in life, visiting and helping take care of their parents until old age took them from this world.\n\nNow, James is seventy-two; wisps of grey hairs poke out of his head like fading memories. His life is dull, his back and hips are worn out to the point he can't garden for long or fire a rifle properly anymore. Old age takes a lot of what you once loved from you, including the people around you. Three siblings lost, and a wife that passed too soon...\n\nBut his son is enough to make it all worth it. The light of his life; the sum of his existence. The culmination of years spent nurturing, like a sapling sprouting into a thick, strong Oak tree.\n\n----\n\nJames lazily flipped through channels on the TV, earning grumpy shouts of refute from the other elderly people sitting in the rec room with him. \n\n\"Keep the damn channel still, you're going to give me vertigo.\"\n\nHe shushed her. \"Quiet, Doris. My son might be on TV again and I need to find him.\"\n\nChannel 5 was the jackpot.\n\n\"*Breaking news, brought to you live: during an armed heist of the local Bank of America, one man took down five burglars single-handed. It's unlike anything we've ever seen before- no hostages were harmed, and the money has been returned safely. We'll keep you updated as time goes by.*\"\n\nThe helicopter camera panned out over a crowd of bystanders cheering and police taking the robbers into custody. Just barely, as James scooted forward and squinted, he could see his son waving to the crowd.\n\n\"See, Doris! That's my Kevin! I told you he'd be on TV again!\" The old man lit up like a Christmas tree on a dark, December night.\n\n\"That's not even impressive. Frank, I want to watch the cooking shows. Change it back already.\"\n\nHis smile faded, twisting into a frown. \"What the fuck am I doing in this place? I'm not Frank. Here, Doris, watch your cooking shows.\"\n\nHe changed the channel, went back to his room and put proper clothes on. *How long has it been? A year, maybe more? Two years? I can't wait any longer. I need to see my baby boy again.*\n\nRifling through his closet, there was a carton of old love letters from his late wife. He looked at them and smiled, but underneath them was a .22 pistol that no one had caught during his entry inspection. He slipped it under his belt and walked up to the front desk. \"Melissa, I'm gonna go for a walk today.\"\n\nShe looked up from her cell phone and lazily waved a hand at him, buzzing the door open. He pretended to follow his usual path, hobbling on his cane, then deviated and slipped through an opening in the brush out back. He made his way to a gas station. \n\n\"Give me your money. Just a few dollars is fine,\" James shouted weakly, gun trembling in the air.\n\nThe cashier was calm for the situation. \"Sir, put the gun down. Let me help you, okay? What do you need?\"\n\nJames' voice began to crack. \"Please, give me some money and call the police.\"\n\n\"Sir, j-\"\n\n\"DO IT,\" he screamed, firing a shot to the right of him. Glass rained down with bits of cardboard and broken cigarettes. The man lifted his arms up and obliged, then handed him a hundred dollar bill.\n\nJames sat down outside the building and waited for about five minutes, staring at the clouds go by. Soon enough, his son arrived, like he always did.\n\n\"My son! I knew the city's superhero would make it here to save the day.\"\n\nKevin groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. \"Dad, I'm not a superhero. I always tell you, I'm just a cop who does his job well. Come on, why'd you go and do something this drastic? Where'd you get the gun? Someone could've really been hurt, Dad.\"\n\nJames looked down, answering meekly. \"I wanted to see you again. It's been several years now, you're always so busy.\"\n\nKevin took a deep breath as his father began to cry. \"Come on, let's take you back to Glowing Meadows.\"\n\nJames lit up again, the hope of a younger man glinting in his eyes. \"Can we play checkers?\"\n\nKevin put an arm around his father, helping him into the car. \"Yeah, we can play checkers. Just get in the car while I explain this to my supervisor, okay?\"\n\n\"Sure thing, Kev, my man. I can't wait for you to tell me all about your job, and your love life. You need to get married and give me grandchildren!\"\n\n\"Yeah, Dad. We'll talk all about it when we get back.\"\n\nHe shut the cruiser door and walked up to his superior officer. \"Sorry, chief. My-\"\n\n\"I heard the whole thing, son. You don't visit your father? I oughtta put *you* in jail. Respect is something the elderly earn.\"\n\nKevin' gaze shifted to the dirt, and he began to tremble a little. His voice was low and weak, barely audible. \n\n\"I just visited him three days ago, sir.\"\n\n-----\n\n*awesome prompt, thank all of you for the kind words and touching stories!!! it's doesn't exactly follow the prompt but I felt the urge to write it.

When i read that line, I interpreted it as \"like he always did (when crime occured)\"","That is also how I read it. Was not an Alzheimer's hint, even looking back","I think they're saying it had a double meaning. ","Same.","How is that an Alzheimer's hint?","It was used as a double meaning. The phrase \"like he always did\", at first glance, implies that he always shows up when there's crime. However, the other meaning after the reader realizes the grandfather had some memory failure implies that he always shows up for his father, but the father never realizes it. I really hope I didn't get all of that wrong, that's what I took from what they said.

I took care of him in his last years, and he had dementia/alzheimers. He whacked me with his cane as he believed I was being disobedient for not hiding his shoes from his nurses. I don't know if he knew who I was towards the end, as he would revert back to his child-like glee from playing games he would make up on the spot. But he would be happy to see me as if the very presence of me at least felt familiar.\n\nHis nursing home was a few blocks away from my school. In the beginning, he came to the school asking when graduation was. I already finished school when this happened. It made me worried how much he walked versus forgetting about my graduation. *It's fucking odd isn't it?* To be sympathetic about someone's physical condition yet understand their deteriorating mental capacity. \n\nThen I saw him dead on a hospital bed which haunts me to this day. Pale skin. Necrosis setting in. \n\nI was a pallbearer at his funeral. It would be the last time I would carry him. \n\nI cried alone. I missed the man who he once was, and I'm glad he no longer has to pretend to acknowledge something he doesn't understand. But that fucking \"checkers\" part you wrote in just really got to me.

Which was fitting, because he was feeling like a bit of a dick. \n\n\"Hold on, honey. Let me help you with that.\" Sylvia pulled the bunched up nylon down past her husband's lips. \"Now you look the part. Shall we go over the plan?\"\n\n\"Sure. Hey, are these the new nylons? They smell sour,\" complained Andrew, scratching at his disguise. \n\n\"Of course, dearest.\" To tell the truth, Sylvia hadn't treated herself to any new clothes for months, which is why she was just right then enjoying the silky rasp of a brand new pair of stockings whilst Andrew was breathing air filtered through the sweat stained fabric of her old ones. She sighed at the snug fit on her legs under that staid skirt she'd put on for the PLAN. Those gams had been the talk of the town back in the day. Twelve new year resolutions to get trim had fallen by the wayside. So many other things to do. \n\n\"OK. According to the Instagram account of our dear Mister Metropolis, junction of first and fourth is his patch.

Give us a kiss before we go.\"\n\n---\n\nAndrew was wheezing as he upended the bag, scattering makeup, receipts and the other mysterious contents of Sylvia's purse onto the concrete. Thirty years and he still had no clue what she put in there. He glanced at his watch. Three minutes. Mister Metropolis was late. And that was the last thing he recalled before a shadow at his side unfolded itself and clocked him so hard across the chin that he was lifted several feet off the ground and smack into the brown brick of the alley. \n\nMister Metropolis stood over him, every inch the superhero. His trading card listed him with superhuman speed, strength and reflexes. The man was sculpted like a corn fed greek god, blond hair, blue eyes, chiselled chin. Muscles rippled under skin tight spandex in blue and gold, clinging to every inch of his body like it had been spray painted on. \n\n\"Jeff Pimble. You will stop right there and help your father up this instant.\"\n\nThe shriek occupied a very specific frequency in the reptilian hindbrain of sons everywhere and brooked no argument. Mister Metropolis, or Jeff, as it were, was already on his knees and picking Andrew up before his higher brain functions kicked in. \n\n\"Mom?\"\n\n\"Oh don't Mom me. You too good to call your parents once in awhile? Too good to come home for Christmas? What's with that hair? What's wrong with with brown?\"\n\nSylvia rattled on; she had the lung capacity of a synchronized swimmer once she had her blood up and, with her hands on her hips and her voice climbing up an octave, her blood was most definitely up. Jeff unfolded his bulk into the naughty dog slouch known to teenage boys everywhere, still trying to fathom how a routine crime bust was rapidly spiralling down into the fourth worst day of his life. For the record, two of the top three also involved his mother. One of them involved an unlocked bathroom door and, regrettably, a wrinkled and much stained Penthouse magazine. It would have been so bad if his mother didn't automatically list all his past sins in reverse chronological order whenever she got started on him, all the way back to the stitches she'd needed after childbirth. \n\nHis train of thought, already teetering on the verge of balance, was totally derailed when his mother gave an ear shattering shriek. \"What in the name of Joseph, Mary and all the saints are you wearing?\"\n\nJeff looked down at his spandex covered body, from his immense pecs (voted Mr Superhero Body Beautiful two years running!) to his superman sized codpiece (never be nutshot again!) and felt the heat rise from his neck to the tip of his ears. \n\n\"Go easy on the boy, Sylvia. How ya doin' son?\"\n\n\"Ummm, hi dad. Not bad I suppose. Are you alright? I hit you pretty hard.\"\n\n\"Nah, I'm good. Truth be told, I've been hit a lot harder back in the day. I'm a little rusty, but I still got it.\" Andrew mimed a classic boxers pose, giving Jeff a playful shot to the shoulder. Jeff grimaced, that tap hurt more than it should have. \"What your momma wants to know is why you don't call any more.\"\n\nSylvia had closed the distance between them and was tying her sweater around the waist of her son, censoring the offending member from any young innocents in the vicinity. \n\n\"I can't be seen around you folks, dad. You know how many enemies I have?\"\n\n\"Ah, I suppose that's why you got all your powers from those government labs instead of having them from when you were a wee lad?\"\n\n\"Have you been looking through my Facebook page, dad?\"\n\n\"Your ma does it. I'm not so good with computers.\"\n\n\"It's all about the ratings, nobody wants to believe someone who grew up on a farm can be a superhero,\" said the boy, still trying to push his mother away from his waist. \n\n\"So you couldn't at least pick up the phone, call your ma once in awhile?\"\n\n\"It's a tough world for heroes. What with all the interviews, sponsors and all that social media stuff, I'm lucky if I have time to fight crime at all.\"\n\n\"Here's the funny thing, son. Sounds to me that you're kinda ashamed of what you are. Or worried that your enemies will come after your folks.\" The older man got to his feet, brushed the dust off his clothes and took the arm of his wife. \"Sometimes you just gotta remember the important things. Like maybe how you got to be so strong in the first place.\" \n\nThe couple left then, leaving Mister Metropolis to stare, open mouth, at the network of cracked bricks his father had left in the wall. \n","wait so is the father super strong? If so, that is awesome.","I assumed after reading that and when the dad asked him about getting his super powers at a lab instead when he was a \"Wee lad\"","Scottish, can confirm, freakishly strong for looking like a pudgy slightly overweight guy","Yeah that part was a little clunky, but that's what I got out of it too. \n\n\nOP, otherwise great job!

She looked around, \"Maybe if we start stealing spoons...\"\n\nRhett shrugged, \"I like sporks.\"\n\n\"Do they even sell sporks at the Piggly-Wiggly?\"\n\nRhett sighed as he made his way to the main house door. \"Maybe we are going about this all wrong. Maybe we should be hitting up the Walmart instead of the local chain places. They have security cameras everywhere. They are quicker with the cops.\"\n\nMabel followed Rhett into the house. They made their way to the kitchen, where newspaper clippings covered every inch of the walls, cabinets and fridge. Clippings of their superhero children performing acts of bravery. Stopping robberies. Fighting the criminal underground. Rescuing people from disasters. Uncovering murderers. The list seemed endless. They were always busy living up to their status as the world's greatest superheroes. Mabel and Rhett were so proud of them. Only it had been a long time since they had seen them in person. Six years, four months and eight days if you asked Rhett. The kids had even stopped returning their calls. The last sign of communication Rhett had received from them was a text that read, \"Still alive. Fighting aliens. Luv you.\" \n\nThat was two years ago. \n\nRhett and Mabel understood their kids had a life of their own but enough was enough. They were still family. And family keeps in touch with each other. The end of the world scenarios be damned. \n\nMabel was the one who came up with the idea of turning to a life of crime to get the kids' attention. \"Teenagers do it all the time. Turn to pretty crimes to get their parents' attention. Shrinks call it, \"cries for help.\" We can do something like that.\"\n\n\"What? Arson?\"\n\n\"No. No. Never. Nothing where people can get physically hurt. I am thinking more like vandalizing walls. Or prank calling.\"\n\n\"Can't do prank calling anymore. Everyone has caller IDs on their phones.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean. Simple things. Things that would raise red flags with the kids.\" Mabel's face lit up. \"Maybe if we are good at this, the kids could throw us an intervention.\"\n\nRhett mirrored her smile. \"Everyone come back at once?\"\n\n\"Yes. I can bake a cake. Maybe even have dinner.\"\n\n\"They aren't going to like this.\"\n\nMabel shrugged at she went to the closet to get her coat. \"If they don't like it then they should visit more often. How about we start with shoplifting? Is there anything we need?\"\n\nRhett grabbed his scarf, \"You can never have too many forks.\" \n\nThe two headed out the door to the car.\n\nThat was two weeks ago. Two weeks of stealing plastic forks and stashing them in their garage. \n\nRhett opened up the fridge and pulled out the milk. He poured himself a glass. \"What about Target instead of Walmart. Get it? *Target.* Or do you think that is a little too on the nose?\"\n\n\"No, we need it to be too on the nose. Honey, I love our kids. They are good kids but, frankly, I think it's time for us to realize that they are dense. We need to make a bigger splash. And I think you are on the right track.\"\n\n\"So, Target. Sporks?\"\n\n\"Walmart. Guns.\"\n\n\"*GUNS*?\" Rhett stared at his wife. He did not like the idea of that. \n\nMabel tried to wave away his displeasure with her hands. \"Or weapons. Or better yet, we buy the ingredients to build a bomb. A big one.\"\n\n\"I-I don't know about that. We could be getting a visit from the FBI if we do that.\"\n\n\"Honey, we know the kids work along side with the FBI. What do you think they will do if they see someone trying to buy the ingredients to bombs in our little town?\"\n\nRhett bit his lip. \"They would come to us to make sure we are safe.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nRhett finished his milk. \"This is a ridiculous idea, Mabel. We could get in so much trouble if this blows up in our faces.\"\n\n\"If it blows up in our faces the kids will still come running to help us. Either way, we win.\"\n\nRhett closed his eyes and thought for a moment. \"Okay. Fire up the computer. Let's see what we need to get to make a bomb...\"\n\nedit:spelling","Please continue, this is really good","My favorite so far","Not an elderly couple, just a father. \n\nJohn awoke to the same buzzing noise he'd been hearing for the last 15 years, the buzzing and beeping of his daughters' landline.\n\n\"Oh great another early morning, wonder if I'll see them today before bed.\" Mumbled John as he got up and looked at the clock, 4:30 AM it read. \"Morning Karen.\" He says looking at the empty side of his bed and at the framed picture on the nightstand. It held the image of his late wife and mother to his daughters. \n\n\"Might as well get some work done today.\" As he puts on his black dress pants and white shirt, hearing his three daughters fly out of the house. \n\n\"Synthesizing test sample 030103.....\n..\n. Complete, traces of compound found, molecular structure unstable. Reproduced result: Negative.\" John's basement computer reads. \n\nIt had been 30 years since he had discovered a scientific fluke and bestowed super human abilities on his infant daughters accidentally. At first it was great, they could fly, were near invincible and had distinct personalities that both conflicted and strengthened their relationship. It was only after a year when their mother, Karen was abducted, they never got a ransom or heard anything besides that she was gone. \n\nThe daughters decided they did not want to leave it to the police and used their powers to search for her, stopping crime as they saw it. \n\nOver their search they stopped monsters, villains, robbers and helped the local police clean up their city. They drew attention and adoration from the city, the Mayor declared them the City's protectors and had a phone installed in their home and his office. It was to be used for emergencies. \n\n\"Pft, emergencies.\" Scoffs John as he remembers these events.\n\nOn the day he lost Karen he lost so much more, his daughters. They were out all day and most of the night from the day that phone was installed. Putting out fires and dealing with the ridiculous emergencies the Mayor seemed to find. \n\nBesides the occasional greeting he never interacted with his daughters anymore, they left before he got up and went to bed before he knew they were home. His attempts to communicate were met with anecdotes of their crime stoppage and how they couldn't give up searching for their mom. \n\n\"Synthesizing test sample 030104.....\n..\n. Complete, traces of compound found, molecular structure stable. Reproduced result: Positive.\" Beeped the computer. \n\n\"Holy shit, I did it, I made the compound again!\" Yelled John. \n\nHe donned his protective suit, a helmet and visor, lead-titanium plated chest piece and slip resistant combat boots; and entered the testing chamber. He took it at a run giddy that he had finally done it. \n\nBoom. \n\nThe compound exploded out of its dish and coated John, he had forgotten that it was pressurized inside and hadn't waited for it to drop before entering. \n\nIt was over, he lay on the ground. All his work had just been undone, his synth computer lay in wreckage around his basement. \n\nHe just wanted it gone, to be able to have his wife and daughters back to normal, but he wouldn't get that. \n\nHe opened his eyes and found himself floating in midair. \n\n\"I can fly?\" Gasped John. \n\nHis experiment had worked, but not in the way he wanted. He wanted a cure to Compound X, now he'd infected himself and miraculously had super human powers as well. \n\nThus PowerProf was born, using his super hero powers Professor, John, Father, decided to dedicate his life to finding his wife and reconnecting with his daughters. \n\n*Cue* Theme song. ","Hahaha it took me until that last paragraph. \n\nI like that description of what happened too. Awesome response :) ","It had been three weeks since Betty had last spoken to her son. Three weeks of pottering aimlessly around the house just trying to keep busy, whilst always hoping to hear the metallic jangle of the house phone. \n\nWhen it did finally ring her heart began to beat fast. She broke into a fast shuffle and almost stumbled down the stairs in her excitement. \n\n'Hello. You could be entitled to free phone cal-'\n\nAs she hung up the phone her heart sank down into her slippers. She walked up the stairs and entered Thomas's old room. She fished out an old costume she had knitted for him back when he was just getting started. It had a big golden albatross emblazoned on it. She huddled up to it and wept.\n\nWhen Betty awoke she was resolute. She *would* see her son. Betty went to her little work room and took to her knitting equipment. She began her work. It had been a while and her fingers weren't as nimble as they once were.\n\nThe next day she stared proudly infront of the full length mirror in the bathroom. The tan coloured cougar costume was fairly accurate. The paunch of her stomach stretched the latex more than she would have wanted, but the long sleek tail made up for it. Anyway, the costume wasn't important, not really.\n\nShe took out her deceased husbands old berretta, God bless his soul, and waited until evening. \n\nThe Bingo hall was full. She walked in and breathed deeply. After saying a little prayer she went ahead with her plan. She pulled out her weapon and shot it into the roof. They handed over the nights prize money easy enough. \n\nShe felt very bad about scaring all the people who were only out for a fun night. She saw two of her friends seated nearby, Martha and Lenny. She gave them a quick wave before realising what she was doing. Martha looked confused but waved back. Betty left as quickly as she could.\n\nShe made the morning paper. They called her the Crawling Cougar - she supposed it was on account of her leisurely speed.\n\nHer next heist went even better than the first. It was during the third Bingo hall heist that he finally turned up, but things hadn't gone to plan. \n\nThe Albatross had flown in heroically through the Bingo hall roof. Rubble and detritus rained down from the hole he had created and a large piece of concrete landed on Betty. \n\nAlbatross walked over and threw the rubbish off of her but it was too late; the damage was done. Her ribs had been crushed and a pool of blood gathered around her.\n\n'I - I only wanted to see *cough* you Thomas. I'm sorry for the trouble I caused.'\n\nThe Albatross gently peeled off her mask and began to sob.\n\n'Don't cry Thomas. I'm so glad I got to see you one last time.' \n\nHer head fell limply to the side and her eyes closed one. There was a tiny smile on her wrinkled face.\n","Nooo to dark.

Some people collect cards. Some people collect stones.\n\nDan collected headlines. He had been collecting headlines for years. In his younger years he had been a newspaper editor, and years before that, his dream was to write headlines. He wanted to shock the world. He wanted to make the dull seem extraordinary, and the interesting seem fantastic.\n\n###DUST BOWL STRENGTHENS\n\nHe flipped through his headlines while drinking his morning coffee. Blonde, no cream, no sugar. It tasted foul, and he liked it that way. His mind wandered down memory lane as he recalled the Depression, and how he finally had his first chance to write a story late in the 30's after he met Ilene. Ilene was the daughter of an editor, and they got engaged soon after Dan's writing career began. \n\n###AMERICA UNDER ATTACK\n\nIlene was pivotal in helping Dan write his first big stories, about the War. When the bombs struck Hawaii, when Dan was sure he would be drafted, and when Ilene got pregnant for the first time...Ilene had always been stronger than Dan. \n\nDan looked up at Ilene, across the table from him. She was smiling back at him, as she always did. Dan looked back down at the headlines.\n\n###AMERICA STORMS NORMANDY\n\nAs war was occurring, their first was born. He was James, named after the King, since he helped to keep his parents strong. After Japan surrendered, their second was born. Ilene was lucky to make it through that night; the doctors were sure either she or the baby would die. A surgeon was somehow able to keep them both alive, and the second baby was born. She was Joy, and she was all the joy that Ilene and Dan ever needed.\n\n###JOHNSON ESCALATES WAR\n\nBy the time the war in Vietnam was raging, Dan was an editor. James was a pilot in the airforce, and Joy was studying to become a surgeon. \n\nDan stared deep into the headline, recalling that Joy and James refused to talk to one another over their stances on the war. Their family had been so happy and so peaceful. He recalled Joy leaving a family reunion in tears, reminding James that her fiance had been shot by friendly fire during the war, even as James insisted that the war was for the betterment of the world.\n\nHer fiance died later that week. She never found love again.\n\n###OPERATION DESERT SHIELD\n\nAs yet another war raged on, Dan began to feel pressure from the media around him. He felt that newspapers were starting to be turned down in favor of nightly television news, or even live news, which he felt was impossible to compete with. \n\nJames was a commander of some sort, stationed far away. After the fiasco at the family reunion, he claimed that he would never find love in solidarity with Joy. Dan later learned that James was actually infertile, and when his girlfriend at the time found out, she had cheated on him and left him. \n\nJames had been gone for years, and Joy refused to talk to Dan and Ilene because she felt that they had betrayed her when her fiance was dying. James was out serving the country, a hero, and Joy was nearing the end of her own career as a surgeon. \n\nDan stopped reading the headlines. He looked at Ilene and told her \"I'm going for a walk.\" \n\nHe stepped into the cold wearing his slacks and a sweater. It had been a lonely twenty five years. Before then, it had been lonely as well. They never heard from James or Joy. Ilene had gotten crippled in her loneliness away from her children. She never forgave herself for Joy leaving. Every time Ilene had tried to call, Joy said she was too busy saving people. \n\nIlene began harming herself, hoping her super hero would come to save her. Dan only found out when he walked into their room and she was bleeding out, with previous scars along her arms. He recalled Ilene looking up at him and asking calmly if Joy was there to save her.\n\nJoy wasn't there, and the doctors weren't fast enough.\n\nJoy showed up the next week, with James. They stayed a week to help Dan get settled back in, and they decided to fly cross country, just the two of them, to reunite their friendship. It was the happiest Dan had been in a long time, knowing his son and daughter were finally friends again. He never heard from them again. \n\nIt had been twenty five years since Ilene passed. Twenty five years since he put her picture at her place at the kitchen table. Twenty five years since his last headline. Dan looked down at the river below, and felt sick to his stomach thinking about how deadly a fall from the bridge could be. He had done some reading, though, and he knew it would be painless.\n\nHe pulled himself over and looked down again. The house was clean, the will was written, and the only thing not put away were his headlines. \n\nDan took a deep breath and let himself fall.\n\nOn the kitchen table was his final headline.\n\n###Plane Crash in Appalachia; No Survivors","This by far has been the best read so far...SO dark and utterly intriguing. ","‚ÄúJanice.‚Äù Her husband said her name but it was the way he said it that made Janice decidedly not look at him. ‚ÄúJanice can we please talk about this?‚Äù Arnold‚Äôs voice was getting more high pitched as he tried to change his stubborn wife‚Äôs mind. She was already half way to the car with two grocery bags gripped in her fists. Money seemed to be stuffed hap-hazardly into the faded bags, with some whipping out the top because of Janice‚Äôs brisk pace. \n\n‚ÄúGet in the car Arnold, you can hide in there if you like‚Ä¶‚Äù The woman spoke harshly as she approached a beige mini-van. In honesty, the thing had seen better days, but that was not the point of the money, Janice and Arnold didn‚Äôt really want for anything, except the attention of their daughter. \n\n‚ÄúWhat if she doesn‚Äôt show up like last time?‚Äù Arnold queried as he rounded the van to get into the passenger side. \n\n‚ÄúThen we‚Äôll just have to up our game,‚Äù Janice mumbled resolutely as she dropped the bags to her feet and waited. She didn‚Äôt seem to care as some of the bills had fluttered loose of their confines and fell at her feet. \n\nThe police sirens in the distance did nothing to weaken her resolute stance. She knew the call had gone out over the scanner, the place they had ‚Äòrobbed‚Äô was owned by a friend. Janice had promised to return all the money plus a little for trouble once the deed was done. \n\nMore sirens joined the din of ones already blaring as Janice kept her eyes overhead. It was pale blue with a smattering of clouds and not much cover, she‚Äôd see her daughter before she was seen.\n\nThe sound of cars zooming down narrow alleys let Janice know the police would round on them soon, but she had to hope Vanessa would get to them first.\nMemories began to swirl in the calm of Janice‚Äôs mind. Memories of her daughter who‚Äôd long ago left her. Hair braiding, first kisses, Vanessa had confided it all in Janice, and now she wouldn‚Äôt even acknowledge a phone call or Facebook message. Janice clenched her fists at the thought of it all. These were the lengths she had to go to see her daughter.\n\nAs if on cue the sound of something flying overhead made Janice lower her gaze as her daughter, in all her power landed before her. A gust of wind, and Vanessa had two feet on the ground, and was staring puzzled at her mother.\n\n‚ÄúMom?‚Äù Vanessa looked a sight, she‚Äôd made some changes to her costume since they‚Äôd last seen each other, all black and midnight purple. It seemed to be made of some hardened material that hugged her daughter‚Äôs figure. A small mask hid the space around her light brown eyes that were now widened in surprise.\n\n‚ÄúWell, I hope you‚Äôre happy‚Ä¶do you see what happens when you don‚Äôt bother to call or visit? I have to resort to‚Ä¶drastic measures.‚Äù Janice replied, her arms now crossed over her chest. She wasn‚Äôt so old that this had no effect, especially on her daughter who raised an eyebrow by the movement of her mask.\n\nA disbelieving scoff came from Vanessa‚Äôs lips as she adopted the stance her mother was in, no thought to the cops who were getting closer. ‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶are you kidding me?‚Äù she asked as she took a step towards her mother. If Janice hadn‚Äôt raised her, she would have been intimidating.\n\n‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Janice drew, letting the word roll on for a few syllables longer than it needed, ‚ÄúI know we‚Äôve had our differences‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDifferences?‚Äù Vanessa burst in now only a foot from her mother, and towering over her by a few inches, ‚ÄúYou kicked me out of the house the first time you found me levitating things in my room‚Ä¶oh wait, that was after you tried to convince our parish priest I was possessed!‚Äù  Janice recoiled at her daughter‚Äôs angry words, her back to the beige van now. \n\n‚ÄúI was‚Ä¶trying to help you‚Ä¶‚Äù Janice tried to reason, ‚ÄúIt was for your own good!‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI tried to tell you over and over that I DIDN‚ÄôT and DON‚ÄôT need help,‚Äù Vanessa shook her head, trying to not let it fall into her leather gloved hands. ‚ÄúI am the help, Mom‚Ä¶‚Äù She added in a softer, sadder tone. \nThe sound of rubber on pavement signaled the arrival of the cops, and Vanessa sighed.\n\n‚ÄúBelieve it or not, I help those who need it, and you two, hi Dad,‚Äù Vanessa looked around her stubborn mother and waved to her timid father in the car, ‚ÄúClearly need a different kind of help‚Ä¶Give uncle Jimmy back his money, and stop it with this stupid crap.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI won‚Äôt stop until you come home, Jason and Darren both still ask about you, you could go back to school. Lead a NORMAL life.‚Äù Janice pushed and moved towards her daughter as if to embrace her. She was rebuffed harshly as Vanessa stepped back. \n\n‚ÄúMom, this is who I am. I‚Äôm not normal, and no amount of your amateur heist‚Ä¶.bullshit is going to change that.‚Äù\n\nThe first squad car was parked and two men were stepping out, it was hard to miss Vanessa standing there ‚ÄúValkyrie‚Ä¶a pleasure as always. Did the job for us again?‚Äù A round man in a police uniform asked as he stepped up to the talking pair. \n\n‚ÄúAs always Officer Claire, ‚Äú Vanessa put on her best smile, ‚ÄúI caught her trying to escape after robbing Jimmy‚Äôs BBQ House, all the money should be here.‚Äù \nJanice was holding her breath for Vanessa to come to her senses. \n\n‚ÄúThis woman was the sole perp, but she gave up easy‚Ä¶maybe a night in jail to set her straight?‚Äù Vanessa wasn‚Äôt looking at her mother anymore, or she would have seen the look of pure horror on her face. Officer Claire seemed to question Vanessa‚Äôs judgement for a moment before nodding and moving to handcuff a shocked Janice.\n\nVanessa turned and shook her head, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for your own good.‚Äù \n","I love this!

A throbbing, dull ache in the side of his neck told him it was time for his pills. These days, getting up was an effort; he braced his hands against the armrest and heaved himself off the chair, staggering into the bathroom. \n\nThe only time he'd every get a bit of life back was when Jude called. Which was, now, never. The endless cycle had taken its toll on him. The spirited, rugged man who could hike five miles and still laugh around at a campfire with his daughter and her friends, grab a beer with their fathers was gone. In his place, there stood a wizened, stooped, wrinkled man with nary a hair on top of his head. \n\n\"Dammit, Jude. Where are you!\" he growled, with surprising intensity. \n\nHe'd had enough. He needed to clear his head. \n\nIt took him ten minutes to get everything and make his way to the door. Inhaler, check. Pills, check. Blue-glowy-thingy, check (he'd always have that one, Jude gave it to him in case of an emergency.)\n\nThe cold winter night pierced his lungs, as cold as that bitch Jenny, his ex-wife. He huddled closer and started down the near-abandoned street. Nearly everything was closed, it was creeping up to midnight after all. But this was the smack middle of the 401 freeway; there was bound to be some 24/7 open. \n\nHe neared a bright convenience store after about half an hour, the sign hung crooked and amid the stains, dirt and grime of nearly fifteen years on the window, it read \"OPEN\". He pushed his way in, covertly checking for signs of a camera or watchmen. The lone cashier was sprawled in his chair, snoring the night away, with a half-empty beer and a old laptop with muted TV-show-thing that started with N, running in the background. He never could get that name right. \n\nThe sneaking around, creeping in the cold, subterfuges in the middle of the night.... They all brought back memories of childhood, of simpler times. Times when the thrill of the chase was everything. That same thrill, despite being a mere shadow of what it was, rushed back to him in an instant.\n\nHe savored it. \n\nHe walked in with a steady foot-after-foot, trying to make as little noise as possible. Reaching the end of the aisle, he glanced around one last time, making sure that there was no one in sight. \n\nIt was like a he was in a trance; he started shoving entire racks worth of items and merchandise into the white garbage bag he had brought. Cans of soup, toothbrushs, condoms, pens, everything he could grab. \n\nHe hurried out as quickly as he could, trying to maneuver the heavy bag with his weak arms. \n\n*BANG*\n\nThe bag was flung in the air, an expletive filled the air and the drunk cashier jerked awake. The most jarring was the uniformed sherrif he had just bumped into.\n\n\"What in the name of-\" a rough voice uttered. \n\n***************************\n\nThe handcuffs were a blur, he couldn't remember what happened after bumping into the sherrif and being bundled into his car.

A faint scent of jasmine lingered in the air; her favorite perfume.\n\nJude. Finally.\n\nWithout opening my eyes, I whispered my voice broke, \"Why didn't you call, Judy.

He had talked to the SW handling the case, she was particularly passionate about the man. It seemed that she'd done everything for him, cooked his meals, cleaned his place and taken care of him.  \n\nAt least that social worker was hot, he visualized her soft curves, great smile in his head, an appreciative grin of his own fighting its way onto his face. He had her number too. \n\n*Why not?* \n\nHe pulled out his phone, searcing for the contact. Jude was it? ","Marie never used to know how many times a phone rings until it goes to voicemail.

Nights staying up with her friends in with her old dial phone, calling Andrew Marks, star of the wrestling team, or any other cute boy the other girls could posit to each other through high-pitched giggles.\n\n\"You've reached Tomas Edwards. I would say all that stuff, but you already know all that stuff bye.\" \n\n*beep*\n\nThe Elfin wood princess of the Lord of the Rings said in her soothing river voice the most irritable command her 82 year old ears had heard, and regrettably, would continue hearing every time she made the hopeless attempt to contact her grandson. \n\n*At the tone, please record you message. After you are done recording your message, press 1.*\n\nThe image of Elfin princess tragically tumbling off a tree branch, her soothing voice breaking into pathetic screams. \n\nShe rubbed her forehead, her dyed-blonde curls bouncing with her hand as she moved the skin back and forth, trying to relieve the tension. \n\nTomas had told her the superhero business was going to be time consuming, and she had accepted that, willingly. All the social stigma that the idea proposed flooded her mind with scenes of Bridge parties where the topic of conversation drifted to the valiant and altruistic acts of courage Captain Tomas had performed that day. And then she would pipe up, between bites of cheese cubes that that was her grandson, and she could remember the days when he would run through her house acting as if his action figures were flying. And everyone would laugh heartily with the memories of their own grandchildren laughing with the glee of innocence; and ignorance. The laughter would slowly fade as the silence crept in because of the daunting realization that their grandchildren were no longer in the ignorant youth of childhood, but now new about the evils of the world. They no longer giggled with meaningless glee as grandma tickled them under the armpit. They no longer cried at meaningless tragedies such as pricking their pinky finger on the car seat. No, they cried to real woes. The woes of lost love, broken friendships, losing their careers. And these woes are kept hidden from their grandparents, as we toil away our days with meaningless cheese parties, trying to forget the days of meaning. \n\nIt seems the natural way of life. The rigid structure of society shoves her into her place roughly, strapping her down with cold chains that cut into her breast and leave red marks for weeks after, reminding her who had the power; and who was powerless. \n\nIf this is society's law, only breaking society's law can break the sorrow that comes  with. If her grandson would not head his own family because of his duty, she will make his family his duty. She will break the law. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Mike,\" called Marie, summoning her cityboy spouse to plan the mission, \"if you were to commit a crime, what would it be?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Mike replied in his gruff construction worker voice, \"I suppose I would have to kill a lad. There's plenty of people that need a good killing I suppose.\"\n\nMarie scoffed. The idea seemed silly at first, yet acceptance emerged slowly from an unknown recess of her mind. A cave, somewhere buried in the wastelands of discarded emotions, hopes, and desires emerged an awaken dragon. Quickly flooding her mind with the fire of vengeance and redemption. If she ever needed anything before she died, it was this. \n\nMike went out into the shed to grab the rifles he had had since childhood. The wood was dusty against her wrinkled hands as they climbed into their Subaru, and headed out into the city. Mike had used these to shoot squirrels with his buddies since junior high he had said, must've been twenty or so years since it had been fired. \n\nThis was when reality hit her. Slapped her across the scalp so hard you are knocked against the wall. When you finally come too, you stand up slowly with a painful wince on your face and a hand on your head, squinting your eyes so hard that at first you can't see the person that hit you. But then, all of the sudden, your vision expands and you see the entirety of reality in lucid clarity as you gaze at wonder at the marvels of the world. \n\nMarie felt all of this and more as she gazed out the car window, the suburbs passing by. In any ordinary person this would have jolted them back to common sense, but this only redoubled her determination. Her mission was no longer blind will, it was reasoned duty. \n\n\"There she is,\" Marie spat out like iron machinery grinding a piece of scrap metal into a flat disk, \"there's the buggar that cheats in all of our Bridge games.\"\n\nThe soon-to-be-victim was walking briskly with a bright smile on her face, her arms swinging widely with each step, just as the article on the internet she had read about how to be an Assertive Female had said to do to emit confidence to observers. Her cute pink sweater was draped over her neck and was slowly sliding off to the right with the purposeful stride she was taking. \n\n\"Hello Dolores,\" Marie spake, her tone rivaling that of a mentally disturbed lemur just arrived home from Auschwitz.\n\nDolores paused in her stride. The greeting wasn't the plastic cheeriness of the hollow-skulled dimwits that she spent all her afternoons with so that her surprisingly clever and philosophical mind kept distracted and wasn't able to create the depressing emotions that it created due to the death of her husband the month before. Of whom, she had still not worked up the courage to call the police, or alert anyone of his condition, as each passing day made the task more and more daunting. How would she explain waiting so long to call?\n\nShe swiveled round in her tight shoes that cramped her toes up so badly that her doctor is recommending surgery to correct the bone straightness. This is idly refused due to her duty to maintain the persona. \n\nHer plastic smile was met with a led bullet and she dropped to the pavement. The blood blending in with her pink sweater. \n\nBefore Marie was able to lower her gun from the frightening scene, there was a rush of air as Tomas flew into the scene.\n\n\"Drop your weapon or be vaporized.\" he demanded in a commanding voice that he had carefully developed in ROTC. \n\n\"Oh Tomas, its you grandmother. Oh baby! how tall you are.\" Marie screeched with glee. \n\n\"3--\"\n\n\"Why? don't you recognize me Tomas? Its your--\"\n\n\"2\"\n\n\"-- grandmother. Come down here--\"\n\n\"1\"\n\nAnd with that the a flash of deep purple erupted from Tomas's fingers. Transforming the Subaru into a blackened smudge of charcoal. \n\n\"Damn batsh!t crazy old people.\" Tomas muttered, shaking his head in disgust. \n\n","\"This is suicide he'll kill us easily. You've seen the news, he shows no mercy\" \n\n\"Doesn't matter. Death is worth seeing our son again. We were the ones who ridiculed and rejected him when he left his ambitions as a business man in order to pursue heroing. Death is a price worth paying if it means we can see Saitama again\" ","The office building lay cold and empty on a Monday morning. The siren blared, with a pretty but cold voice telling everybody to evacuate. The building was empty except for a single occupant on the forty-sixth floor. She was humming a pop song of the eighties, while pouring soup out of a thermos flask. That was when the concrete wall came to life, crumbling to bits to let in the daylight. \n\n‚ÄúFear not, Mighty Kong is here!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAbout time, too.‚Äù The granny‚Äôs response was surprisingly calm as she held up a hand to shield her eyes from the light. \n\nKong‚Äôs eyes took a second to adjust to the darker interior of the building. He heaved a mighty sigh. ‚ÄúMum! Not again.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI made soup, why don‚Äôt you come down and have some?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm busy.‚Äù Kong‚Äôs voice has always been infamously booming. But in that moment, he was mumbling. Slowly, he hovered closer and closer towards the elderly criminal. \n\n‚ÄúI know you are, so I bought you some time. I picked four pockets ‚Äì well, two of them caught me and gave me some change instead. I stole from the convenience store but the guy was like, nodding really violently to the noise in his earphones so he didn‚Äôt notice me at all. And here we are, a bomb hoax in the prime office building in the center of the city. Plenty to keep you occupied.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how it works Mum‚Ä¶‚Äù the hero began.\n\n‚ÄúJust hear yourself. Your throat sounds parched. C‚Äômon, drink up before you say anything else.‚Äù\n\nKong let his toes slowly drop to the floor, and then his heels. A steaming bowl of soup was filled to the brim and set on the table, beside a thermos flask. Beside them were several wallets and some unopened packs of condoms. His mother was positively glowing with pride as she beamed at him. But her voice was dismissive. \n\n‚ÄúStill having fun playing this hero thing eh?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much fun at all. The hours are irregular, I am on standby all the time. I get all sweaty and just yesterday, the kid I saved made a comment about the smell. I don‚Äôt even have time to buy deordorant.‚Äù He sighed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs work, Mum. I‚Äôve got to protect the city.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRight now, you‚Äôre protecting it from me. I‚Äôll steal a few bottles of deordorant from the store next time. Here you go, drink up.‚Äù She held out the bowl of soup, which he finally took. \n\n‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt steal anything anymore, Mum. I don‚Äôt enjoy turning you in.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell, if only I could **buy** it for you,‚Äù her voice escalated in pitch and loudness, and then she swallowed the emotion, ‚Äúand have you show up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThere, I‚Äôve finished the soup.‚Äù He set down the bowl. ‚ÄúPlease return those things Mum.‚Äù \n\nHis heels bounced off the ground ever so slightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back for the weekend, if things aren‚Äôt so busy. I promise.‚Äù\n\nAnd then he zoomed into the distance until he became a speck in the blinding sunlight. \n\n‚ÄúSo all I‚Äôve got to do is protect the city for the weekend, eh?‚Äù The granny muttered to herself as she went about keeping her things. \n\n---\n\n2nd drafts eventually go [here](https://fivenswrite.wordpress.com).","Shadow Man Wrapped the Darkness on the rooftop around the mans arms and neck. Not tight enough to actually hurt him but enough so that he would feel it. On the ground was a duffle bag that had been stuffed with cash but had now spilled everywhere \"I want you to remember what happened here today...\"\n\n\n\"Save it Tom Its me.\"\n\n\nHe paused for a moment then dragged the darkness away from the mans face to see him better. \"Dad? What are you doing here?\" He asked as he set him down.\n\n\n\"Well since you never call anymore I thought this was the best way to get your attention.\"\n\n\n\"Dad, I've been a little busy. How did you even know It was me?\"\n\n\n\"Oh please, I remember that phase you went through in high school. That costume looks pretty familiar.\"\n\n\nTom looked down at himself in mild embarrassment. \"Dad you could have just called me.\"\n\n\n\"You never answer.\"\n\n\n\"And now you know why! You call at the most inconvenient times. In case you didn't notice some serious shit has started happening over the last few months.\"\n\n\n\"Language Tommy.\" a woman's voice said behind him. She had a ski mask on, a black turtle neck, and a similar bag to the one his father had.\n\n\n\"Mom? are you Fucking Serious right now?\"\n\n\n\"Language Tommy, you'll never find a nice girl with that mouth.\"\n\n\nHe briefly thought about telling them that he had been seeing someone but then decided against it. \"Guys, You didn't have to do this.\"\n\n\n\"You haven't been at thanksgiving in two years.\"\n\n\n\"Last year Lightning rod tried to build a death ray and the year before I had to work overtime.\"\n\n\n\"You haven't been at Christmas in five.\"\n\n\n\"Okay for one thing a portal to hell opened last year and for another you always invite Aunt Susan and you know she never shuts up about her son making partner and incidentally his firm works for the Russian Mafia but I just have to keep civil.\"\n\n\"You could at least call us once in a while.\"\n\n\n\"I'm a super hero for fucks sake I don't....

Mom, Dad, you are going to take those costumes off and bring that money back. I'll try and call more often okay?\" He jumped off the roof and vanished into a shadow on the wall.\n\n\n\"Will you be there for Easter Dinner?\" His mother called out to him as he zoomed into the distance.\n \n*****\n\n\nTom Walked into the high tech fortress where the trio met. Captain Amazing was slumped backwards in a chair and Lady Calamity was drinking coffee. Calamity noticed him walk in first. \"Tom are you okay? You look Terrible.\"\n\n\n\"Thanks Shay. My parents robbed a convenience store to get my attention.\"\n\n\n\"Oh. I'm sorry. That sucks. Why did they do that?\"\n\n\n\"I haven't called or been over in a while and they wanted me too, so they decided robbing a place was a good idea.\"\n\n\n\"My Parents are dead.\" Captain Amazing said after waking up with a start.\n\n\n\"Yes Wesley.

Like back when we were in high-school!‚Äù The elderly woman said as she pointed the gun at the cashier.\n\n‚ÄúOooh! I‚Äôll take the mints hun, you grab the shampoo.‚Äù Said the elderly man to his wife as he went over to grab the mints.\n\nAs soon as the older woman walked to grab the shampoo a sudden flash appeared into the room. She had short blonde hair and a round face, accentuated by bright red lips. Her outfit was a bright white cloth that hug her body a little too much for her parent‚Äôs taste, with a black belt that seemed to show off her backside and a symbol directing the stares to her chest. The cashier ducked behind the table as the two elderly criminals walked over and gave the superhero a tight hug. The woman sighed and almost began to run before there arms overtook her.\n\n‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you ever call anymore Sue?‚Äù Said the old woman.\n\n‚ÄúSue? Whose Sue? I‚Äôm Metro Girl!

The pooled ingenuity of the parents of this generations super heroes should not be taken lightly even if we may be frail in our physique and our knowledge slightly out dated. What worked back in the day still works now. \n\nTook a month to build the gyroscopic stabilizers, another six for the superstructure around them and four more to properly fuse the armor plating without drawing in too much attention to our power consumption. Not to even mention the time it took to get the supplies together. Though I'm sure the local junkyard owners may have become suspicious due to the influx of elderly looking for materials and incessantly haggling for ever lower prices.\n\nA mechanical monstrosity made completely hacker proof by its hand made vacuum tubes and old analog technology. The last time one of these walked on this earth was nearly fifty years ago. Now, with some modern upgrades to the power-source and weaponry the kids wont know what hit them. Replacing the gun turrets with sound cannons should work wonderfully. Those should put the local kids wee car speakers to shame. Maybe even teach them a lesson on how to properly make senseless noise disturbances. \n\nNone of it lethal of course, fully automated and just menacing enough to scare the locals away and the Justice Friends in to action. The target was to be the local city hall. Where several of us would be conveniently having coffee across the street and needing rescue. \n\nWe cant get them to call, write a letter, nor come visit of their own volition, but we will be damned if we cant make them come to see us even if only for a second. If nothing else, at least we killed some time with the group project.\n\nFor the next attempt we are split between building a flying saucer to fake our own abduction, or maybe faking an alien invasion. Aiming a disintegration beam at City Hall and evaporating its roof should serve the politicians right for de-funding the senior center in town. \n\n\n\n","An old couple was very sad,\n\nTheir superhero kids wouldn't call,\nSo they took to the mall,\n\nStole a Star Wars toy sith,\n\nBut their kids have better things to deal with.","We didn‚Äôt start out at thieves, you understand. Not in the slightest. Well, Dave admitted recently that his petty crimes did begin a little earlier than my own, but nothing stolen was ever more valuable than a pack of gum, and he called his life of crime by his seventh birthday. \n\nI, on the other hand, didn‚Äôt commit my first robbery until the age of 72. I spent weeks sewing the perfect all-black outfits that wouldn‚Äôt get too uncomfortable for us to wear, and I even used a lint roller on the ski masks after the cats snuggled up with them, leaving white hairs all over our disguise. Clad in the right gear, armed with Dave‚Äôs old pop gun spray-painted black, we held up the gas station a mere mile from home. \n\nThe proceeds were slimmer than we expected: a grand total of $114. Nonetheless, every penny went straight into the collection plate at church the following Sunday. We may be criminals, but we would never profit from these crimes. That would make us monsters!\n\nInstead, consider this our old-age cry for attention. We tried guilting our kids into visiting more, calling incessantly until they answered the phone and made an obligatory visit. We tried visiting them ourselves, but their hours were long and we always felt like an inconvenience. Plus, at our age, long trips just aren‚Äôt as easy as they once were. Now, we‚Äôre bringing them to us. Every crime we commit gets a little more attention, and any day now we expect them to fly in and see us. \n\nYou see, our kids have some unusual professions. Personally, I had high hopes that the pair of them would become doctors. What mother wouldn‚Äôt love a pair of handsome doctor sons? Instead, they went a different route: Superhero brothers. They always did love the attention, if we‚Äôre being honest about it. \n\nDo I regret making them little red capes when they were younger, or laughing at their adorable little underpants worn over blue jeans? Perhaps. I wasn‚Äôt to know the creative costumes would inspire their careers, but there you have it. \n\nI‚Äôm proud they are saving the world, and I know Dave is too. Can you imagine being the parents of those criminals they catch instead? Now, that would be truly horrifying. So I‚Äôm  glad they get to be heroes, putting away the bad guys and saving damsels in distress and all that. Would it kill them to visit every once in a while, though? Or do we have to kill, just to get them to visit?","The red-faced woman walked into the Super Fast Emporium with a cigarette hanging precariously from her lip like a magic trick. Ranjit could smell the booze on her from behind the counter; better yet, he could probably name the brand. Years working nights at his parents' store had made him something of an expert, like a sommelier of shitty beer. *Aromas of mud, urine, and crushed menthol cigarette butts lift this evening's Schlitz drunk to the height of her lowest point.*\n\nThough her gait was unsteady, her route to the beer fridge was dead-straight. Predictably, she opened both of the doors and stood in front of them, swaying as if in some trancendental state before an altar of low-cost suds. Rajit considered asking her to hurry, but his desire to avoid interaction for as long as possible outweighed his concerns for the electric bill.\n\nFinally the woman chose, and slowly made hre way to the register, a twelver hanging at her side like old luggage. She hoisted it up to the counter with a foul wheeze and asked for a pack of smokes to boot. Up close now, Rajit noticed the bulbous alky nose, the bloodshot eyes, the 30-year-old bleach blonde hairdo...this lady was serious business. The kind of person for whom sobriety was as vague and fleeting as a remembered nightmare. \n\nHis misgivings about selling alcohol to a drunk person quickly went away; he was dealing with a professional here.\n\nAs he watched her paw at her yellow swimming trunks in search of her wallet, however, he had second thoughts. How did she even get here? Did she *drive?*\n\n\"Ma'am, are you sure you need this?\" he asked. \n\n\"Huh? What? Oh don't you fuckin start with me, bin Laden. Just...hold on, where's my fuckin shit?\" \n\n\"I don't mean to be rude. It's just...I can see you're already drunk, and--\" \n\n\"*Here!*\" she said, slamming her wallet down on the counter. Then, realizing that this isn't how commerce works, she snatched it back and began thumbing through it. Eventually, she came up with enough to cover it, and flung a pair of twenties at him. The bills took wing and pulled evasive maneuvers, looping back and landing at her feet. As she bent over to pick them up, she cracked her head square on the counter. The drunk woman straighened up like a bolt, eyes wide and searching. Rajit reached across and grabbed her by the shoulders.\n\n\"Christ, woman, are you alright?\" \n\n\"You attacked me!\"\n\nHe let go. \"That's it. Get out. You're a danger to the both of us.\"\n\nThe audacious drunk took offense to that. \"Yeah? Allah tell you that?\" she said, carefully retrieving her fallen notes from the floor. Then she made a high-pitched *looloolool* sound for reasons only she would ever know. \n\n\"I'm Indian, dumbass,\" he said as she left. \"Actually, I'm American. I've never even *been* to India, so why don't you--fuck it, she's gone... And so are the cigarettes! Son of a *bitch!*\"\n\nRajit sighed deeply, and wondered how many other convenience store clerks were sighing at that very moment. Probably millions, he figured. \n\nThe door chimed while he returned the beer to the cooler, but he didn't see the customer until he had returned himself to the register: An old woman in a dark tracksuit pushing an even older man, wearing a matching tracksuit, in a wheelchair. They both held eye contact with Rajit as she slowly wheeled him closer, every few feet his shaky, spotted hand puling a snack from a shelf and tucking it into his jacket. By the time they reached the counter, he had stolen enough sugary food to put the both of them into a coma. \n\n\"What the fuck are you doing?\" Rajit said. It wasn't rhetorical; he genuinely had no clue what was happening. \n\nThe old woman stepped out from behind the wheelchair. \"Come here, kid.\"\n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\"Just do it.\"\n\nRajit leaned over and the woman took his face between her thumb and forefinger. Her bony fingers felt like steel digging into his cheek. \"No,\" he shrieked. \"No, don't!\" \n\nBut it was too late. Her movement was smooth in a way that belied her age--she raised her free thumb and ran it down the length of her tongue in one swift motion. Then, before he knew it, she ground the slimy digit into his chin, again and again. \n\n\"Here, you got some shmutz.\"\n\nThe deed done, Rajit pulled away and wiped the spit off with his shirt. \"God! Gross! Now what the hell is going on? Put the food back before I call the cops.\" \n\n\"The cops,\" the old woman said. \"won't be enough to handle us.\"\n\n\"I'm pretty sure the cops can handle a couple of geriatric Cheeto thieves.\" \n\n\"You must not know who you're talking to, son,\" said the old man. \n\n\"We're the infamous *Connie and Clyde!*\" announced the old woman. \n\nRajit said, \"Isn't it supposed to be *Bonnie* and Clyde?\"\n\n\"I told you it was a stupid idea, Carol.\"\n\n\"BONNIE IS A WHORE'S NAME, STAN!\"\n\n\"My *mother's* name was Bonnie,\" whined the old man. \n\n\"I rest my case.\" \n\n\"Did that drunk lady shoot me? Is this Qwiki-Mart Hell?\" Ranjit slapped himself across the face. \"Wake up, Ranjit! These crusty white folks aren't real, it's just a dream! Wake up!\"\n\nThe old woman smiled a menacing, Polident smile. \"It's not a dream, kid. We're here to clean you out. Your only hope...I said your only hope...STAN!\"\n\nThe old man startled. \"Huh? Oh, oh, right. '...is to call The Guardian of Good!\"\n\n\"Um, I'm pretty sure I don't need a superhero to stop you two.\"\n\nThe woman reached across the counter. \"Wait, I see more. Right there. No, *there*. Just come here, let me get it.\"\n\n\"Okay, alright, I'm calling him! It'll be fun to watch him pound you two geezers anyway.\" \n\nRajit reached under the counter and pressed the Guardian's call button (every convenience store has one) and within moments, a blur of green came flying thorugh the door. Fists on his hips, the hero in green tights puffed out his chest and said: \"Did someone call...THE GUARDIAN OF GO--Oh for fuck's sake. Ma? Dad? *This again?*\"\n\n\"My baby!\" the old woman squealed as she shuffled to him. The old man tried to turn in his chair to no avail. \"Eh, is that him?\" he asked Ranjit, who was too stunned by the developments to reply. \n\n\"Ma, what did I tell you? 'No petty larceny to get my attention.' I'm too busy for this!\"\n\n\"Too busy for your mother?\" she said, whacking him on the shoulder. She then turned to Ranjit, who hadn't had the chance to pick his jaw up from the counter. \"You see how he talks to me? You see how he *treats* me?\" \n\nThe Guardian of Good slouched, as if all the energy had been sapped out of him. \"Ma, I'm supposed to take you to jail. Jail, ma. Understand? That's the position you put me in!!\" \n\n\"Don't talk to your mother like that!\" barked Stan, still turned the wrong way in his chair.\n\n\"Yeah, don't talk to your mother like that!\" Rajit heard himself say. \n\nThe three of them looked at Rajit as if he had just farted. The Guardian of Good opened his mouth to speak, but as he did there was a terrible cackle in the air, like the laughter of the devil himself. \n\nSuddenly, a dark figure appeared at the door. He wore all black, and a half-mask that covered his eyes, leaving a large, frightening grin from which protruded a long, reptilian tongue. \"IT IS I, THE BLACK LIZARD! AND I HAVE COME FOR YOU, GUARDIAN! AT LONG LAST, I HAVE COME FOR YOU! MUHUHAHAHAHA!\"\n\nThe Guardian of Good stepped in front of his parents and put up his dukes. \"I've waited for this moment ever since you slithered out of the sewers, snake! It ends tonight!\"\n\n\"Not so fast, you two!\"\n\nThe combatants halted. Turned to the speaker. It was Carol. In her hand, a cellphone. \"Sonya?\" she said, looking at the screen. \"He's here.\"\n\nThe door to the ladies room flew open and banged against the wall, and a middle-aged Puerto Rican woman emerged. \"Mi nino!\" she screamed, arms wide as she ran to The Dark Lizard. She threw herself at him and tackled him to the ground, peppering his face with smooches. \n\n\"Wait, she was in there the whole time?!\" Ranjit asked. No one answered. While the two families sorted out their strange business, Ranjit slinked off to the back, where he promptly called his mom. \n\n","David Enfield was raised in a tough neighborhood. But he had managed to come through and made a good life for himself. He however went down a dark and dirty path, becoming a corrupt cop. He had married a beautiful Russian woman named Sola and together they made a wonderful little girl named Alexa. However one day as David was responding to an industrial accident on bring your daughter to workday, there had been a terrible industrial accident at a local genetics research facility, her daughter who had been curious as a monkey was accidentally exposed to chemicals but it did not kill her, however it did give her the ability to control electricity. \n\n\nDavid and his wife Sola, were distraught and terrified of their daughter,bit one day a bald dude in a wheel chair came and offered to take her to a special school for the gifted and help her co trol her powers. The parents obliged grateful for his help. As Alexa grew up she became \"Acer\", a crime fighter. And graduate of the Xaviers school.\n\n\nHer father however was finally caught for his corruption but he made a deal where he ratted out his fellow corrupt cops and he wasn't jailed but a gap formed between him and his daughter. She had become ashamed of him. She refused to return any of his calls, answer his messages. So after years had gone, he came up with a brilliant plan to meet her, he would commit an armed robbery of the local diner. So he bought an old Colt. 45 and headed out to the diner. \n\n\nHe entered the diner, walked towards the cashier, pulled out his gun. \" Give me the money he screamed!\"\nThe cashier recognizing that his shitty minimum wage job was not worth dying over quickly handed over most of the money pocketing a few dollars himself. \"Call the cops now.\" David asked. The cashier was perplexed but did it anyway.\n\n\nSuddenly one of the patrons of the diner a fat white man who had seen too many Chuck Norris movies and bought into the NRA propaganda about good guys with guns tried to pull out his Desert Eagle, the size of which was meant to compensate for his lack of. David however being a trained cop had the drop on him and shot him before the man could pull it out of his holster. He collapsed in a heap\n, clutching his chest the ground trembling a bit from his weight.\n\n\nDavid was expecting his daughter to come through the door any minute to apprehend him but today was not his lucky day. Suddenly Wade Wilson aka Dead Pool walked out the diners toilet, he was struggling with his red suit. He uttered as he casually walked into the scene, \"Boy did I just take am epic shit in there.\"\n\n\n\nEveryone stared at him in silence. \n\n\nHe noticed the scene of murder, the dead man oozing his cholesterol laden blood on to the diner floor. \"Today is your unlucky day.\" He said looking at David. He pulled out his katana, \"I am gonna do to you what OJ Simpson did to Nicole.\" David tried to aim his gun at Dead Pool but he was too fast and with a few quick stabs David lay dead on the floor, his entrails leaking from his guts. Dead Pool quickly robs hims, high fives the cashier and ran out the room.

My wife will surely have it and this post killed a good weekend. ruined."],["2016 was horrible for both parties.\n\nSee, the Democrats had Hillary Clinton, but most people didn't want to have her as the president. In fact, about two-thirds thought she was dishonest. The Republicans had Donald Trump, or as John Oliver put him, \"a clown made of mummified foreskin and cotton candy\".\n\nSo, my friends and I decided to file FEC paperwork under my name. See, I've never really voted along one party line, so I just kinda put both parties. It was a joke! Honest! I hung those papers up on the wall and my friends and I had a good laugh.\n\nThen Iowa came. I won 70% of voters across the state. Turns out Mic. was doing an article on satirical candidates, and I had become some kind of internet sensation overnight. r/PhillipsWoodsForPresident was one of the most active subreddits, above r/HillaryClinton (but that's not much competition), r/The_Donald, and r/SandersForPresident. Hell, I had a campaign website, an ActBlue and an RNC donation page with about 10 million in donations from small donations of less than $2,700.\n\nThen I won both parties in New Hampshire, trailed Clinton in Nevada, South Carolina, Alabama, and Arkansas, and won the Republican primaries in all of those states. So, apparently both the DNC and the RNC provided me with campaign managers, staff, etc. that I didn't even know about until they came to my house and asked why I wasn't out campaigning. Seriously? I work Data Entry at a dental office.\n\nSo, they made me say a couple speeches. Basically, I was pro-gun, pro-LGBT rights, favoring a smaller government with more economic regulation, neutral on immigration, all of that. I started believing in myself, too. I shook hands with nearly every congressman and congresswoman in Washington. I was \"the savior of the Democratic and Republican parties\".\n\nI went to a couple of debates, and I just talked. Seriously, I didn't yell, didn't scream, wasn't aggressive. I literally just told people what I believed, and people were happy with a \"refreshing new candidate\" that didn't take corporate money. I flustered O'Malley and Webb, and they dropped out before Colorado. Hillary Clinton dropped out because she had received such low voter turnout, so it was just between me and Bernie Sanders.\n\nTrump dropped out in disgrace, saying, \"He's a loser! He's a democrat! The democrats are ruining the Republican Party! But now, I must make America great again through the private sector, not the public one. Also, my hands are not small!\" Jeb Bush dropped out because he had the whole of 10 votes in 6 states. Ted Cruz couldn't run because he was a Canadian, and public opinion shifted against him. John Kasich was John Kasich. Nobody voted for him.\n\nAnyways, that's how I ended up as the front-runner of both parties. I took Sanders as my Vice-President due to the public support and his experience getting things through the Senate.\n\nI had won 76% of this country's vote in the primaries. I won 94% of the popular vote, with 3.5% going to Jill Stein of the Green Party and 2.4% going to Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party. it was the first time in history both the Democrats and Republicans had won a landslide victory. I served my presidency as \"The Great Uniter\", working to decrease the debt and increase personal freedom and security. People loved me. My approval rating never went below 75%.\n\nSo I took a trip to my home state of Texas. Toured around the state, went to Dallas. Drove down Elm Street in Dallas, and I got shot by some guy with the Party for Social Liberation, which got, like, 0.0003% of the vote. As the country's most popular president of the last 20 years, I died during my last 2 years in office, on the same street JFK died on. \n\nThey rushed me to Parkland, but it turns out no amount of surgery can repair a gunshot to the head. I died, and \"The Great Uniter\" was gone.\n\nI'd like to say maybe I had a difference. That the Republicans and Democrats would unite under my death. Instead, both parties blamed the other for not stopping the Party for Social Liberation from killing me. The greatest irony of my death is that \"The Great Uniter\" divided this country more than ever by his death.\n\nThis country's greatest divide was my death. Go figure.\n\n*If you liked this, please read more of my stories on r/TheTexasKid and subscribe!*","&gt;John Kasich was John Kasich.

I talked to Bill about it, he was still optimistic after the first few days.  \n\n\"Trust me man, I know how this works, all you gotta do is say some crazy shit, and then everyone will start clamoring about you. Gingrich did it to me in 94.  Go for the right wing first, they're pretty easy to rile up, just say something bad about Muslims\"\n\nI took his advice to heart, and the next day, I called a press conference, walked up to the podium, Bill confidently giving me a thumbs up from the 5th row.  I waved at the crowd and approached the podium, trying my best not to show my quivering legs.  \n\nI cleared my throat, adjusted the mic, and cried loudly for the world to hear,\n\n\"We're gonna build a wall\"\n\nEdit: I know that Bill Clinton ran on a platform of being super moderate, and would actually suggest to run super moderately, but you know, literary liberties and such","Love it!","Tuesday evenings had fast become my favorite time of the week. It was at 6:30 p.m. sharp that 'Lou's Real Democracy' published the primary polling results of every presidential candidate. Unlike Gallup and Rasmussen and those other giants, Lou's included anyone who garnered a single vote out of the 1,000 or so sample size generally taken. Self-righteous as they were, I did appreciate these super-liberal bloggers.\n\nI popped a few Red Baron french bread pizzas into the toaster oven, settled down into my well-loved suede craigslist couch, and fired up the laptop to Lou's site.\n\n**July 5th, 2016 - Democratic Presidential Nomination (National)**\n\nBernie Sanders:     1982 (182 superdelegates)     48% Popular (+2%)\n\nHillary Clinton:       2122 (319 superdelegates)     44% Popular (-3%)\n\nAbraham Lincoln:   0 (0 superdelegates)              1% Popular (+/- 0%)\n\n**July 5th, 2016 - Republican Presidential Nomination (National)**\n\nDonald Trump:     1201     52% Popular (-4%)\n\nTed Crud:            612       28% Popular (+3%)\n\nJohn Kaisch:        187       8%   Popular (-1%)\n\nTeddy Bear:         0          1%   Popular (+/- 0%)\n\nI snickered every time. I had taken advantage of an obscure early 19th-century rule that allowed candidates to alter their given names on ballots. I had toyed with even more mainstream monikers, like \"Frodo Baggins,\" but decided I was already pressing the envelope. A small part of me still expected some joint Democratic and Republican goon squad to come busting down my door any day now.\n\nThe most astounding part was that I hadn't run any campaign. 30 minutes of Googling nominating procedures and half a day of chasing paperwork around and I was suddenly sitting on each party's respective ballot. *True democracy in action*, I thought.\n\nWith each party's convention only a week away and neither side's top candidates possessing enough delegates to win, I had been daydreaming of just one delegate stepping to the podium and announcing, \"I have decided to cast my vote for Teddy Bear!\" Or Lincoln. As long as my 15 minutes of fame could extend just a bit longer.\n\nI switched over to Google News. *I may as well keep myself informed. I'm a politician now!* I thought smugly. As I began skimming the headlines, my stomach began to drop. I checked the date. No, April Fool's was months ago. Is this *The Onion*? A prank? Must be a hack. My vision began to blur and I had to literally shake my head to regain focus.\n\n***Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Shot at Respective Rallies***\n\n***Ted Cruz and John Kaisch Found Dead in Hotel Rooms; Trump Missing, Presumed Dead***\n\nIt was plastered over every visible page. There were no other stories until I scrolled down to some tech article about Apple iBusiness. My body felt weighted down with lead and my head was a wash of fog. I could smell my pizzas burning, but couldn't bring myself to move, much less get to the kitchen. I heard a bell echo in the distance. It grew louder, more demanding. I realized it was my phone, going off on the coffee table. I numbly reached over and picked it up.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Roberts. It appears a wonderful, *accidental* piece of luck has suddenly befallen you. A car will be by to pick you up in 10 minutes. Be a good lad and don't try to leave before we get there.

Surely, I would wake up soon.","Holy shit, that was intense!

His speeches riled up the masses. He sweeped up states after states with demands further to the left than any mainstream candidate dared to ask. Compared to others, the candidate who held an entire speech in Cherokee, who openly supported basic income and universal healthcare, who juggled during a speech to make a point and who openly suggested an EU candidacy of the USA was the drop of bright red in a sea of drab brown. \n\nHis republican rival Sammy Landvogt looked strong to a very different demographic: Tough on immigration and on crime, speaking with the broadest Texas accent that could still be understood, was armed whenever legally possible, baptist, creationist and dominionist. Tough on crime, drugs and the poor. He opposed abortion, gay marriage and wanted to make America \"as great as she once was\". His healthcare plan was prayer and worker's rights as well as minimum wage laws were to him a way to sabotage the economy, the lifeblood of America. State after state fell for his charm.\n\nThe fact that the republican and the democrat conventions were not on the same day was advantageous for a certain comedian. He decided to satirize the US-elections by running both under his birth name and under his nickname: Sigmar and Sammy. He couldn't imagine that people actually supported him in both forms. He would have thought people understood the exaggerated claims, faked statistics and media gestures but they didn't. He could come out as being Sigmar to the Republicans or being Sammy to the democrats and cause delicious chaos, but as there were only a few days until the first convention, he had another idea: why not run as both? Few people would ever get a presidency handed to them ike that. Why give that away? He called his twin: \"Mark?

Some would say it was rather crass to decide major policy on the flip of a coin but I was getting desperate.  The coin flipped through the air, end over end before hitting the table and falling to the floor.  My campaign manager Corey and I both peered over the table and saw heads.  \n\n\"Alright... What's next?\"  I asked as Corey scribbled the final decision of pro-life in his notebook.  \"Labor unions?  Gay marriage?\"  I went through a list of policies in my head deciding which one to choose.  \n\nCorey finished writing down my newest \"belief\" and thought for a moment before spurting out \"How about gun control?\"  It seems like such a complex issue but I'm sure the coin will understand.  I shrugged my shoulders as if I didn't really care what was next.  Corey picked up the coin and said \"Alright... Heads we go with stricter regulations and tails we go with looser regulations.\"  \n\n\"Sounds fair to me.\"  I agreed as I took the coin from his hand and prepared to send it sailing into the air.  Suddenly I was overcome with grief.  How could I continue to go along with this farce of a campaign?  \"What are we doing?\"  I asked Corey in a moment of clarity.  \"Do I not stand for something?  Do I not have any beliefs of my own?  How ridiculous of us to sit here and make major decisions that could effect this great country for decades or perhaps even centuries!  They will write about me in the textbooks as the Coin-Flipping President.  Students in future generations will study me like they do great dictators for their ineptitudes.  I have an opportunity to be truly great and make a difference in this world!  I've reached across party lines and met people in the middle.  People that are sick of the status quo have looked to me as their savior and here I am treating it like some sort of joke.  What is wrong with me?\"  \n\nI looked to the coin again and decided to set it down on the desk.  I stared at it for a few minutes and then I couldn't bare to look at it anymore.  \"Why would I ever agree to do this?  I feel like the lowest form of scum on the planet.  Global warming decided by the flip of a coin?  Oh, hey, there is a genocide going on overseas... does anyone have a quarter?  I can make a difference and I will make a difference.\"  \n\nCorey looked at me like he couldn't believe what I was saying.  \"But this is how we have always done things Mr. Trump.\"  \n\nI looked back at him and thought for a moment.  My eyes trailed back to the quarter sitting on the table.  After a few seconds of reflection, I picked up the quarter, smiled and gave a quick nod before giving the coin yet another flip.  ","\"I mean look, I've always thought of myself as a Republican, I mean after all I was the president and I won as a Republican in 2016 against Hillary, but y'know folks, I've done everything I set out to do. The wall was built by early 2018, it's a beautiful wall by the way folks, isn't it? Don't we love our border patrol, folks? Anyway, it was paid for by Mexico a month later, and then I focused on making the healthcare system more competitive, which brought prices way way low, and then I focused on jobs and things like that. I brought down the unemployment rate, by the way, to .8%. Believe me, and it's going down still folks, that wouldn't have happened under Crooked Hillary.\"\n\n\"And then I reformed the voting system, of course, our corrupt voting system that I still somehow won under. Amazing. Amazing. I made it so that you no longer have to be afraid of voting for who you want to win.\"\n\n\"So here's the story, folks, I have helped create a Congress that is far more representative of the people than any other before it. You know, I read a story in the New York Times, very bad newspaper by the way, I was happy when it failed, that said \"Trump is causing political unrest\". Really? I'm causing political unrest by letting the people vote for who they want to win? Unbelievable.\"\n\n\"So anyway folks, I did make our political system far more fair, however, the Republican party and Democratic party are still too big. They have far more money. So what I'm going to do before I leave is run these down to the same level as all the other parties. I mean, I've set out to do things and I did everything I wanted to. So the least I could do to end it is bring these parties down.\"\n\n\"So starting tomorrow, I am going to run as both a Republican and a Democrat. And believe me, this is going to ruin both of them.\"\n\nSo God-Emperor Trump did just that. As the incumbent, he was already the Republican nominee, so he focused on winning the Democratic nomination. It was Chasin' Chelsea (because she's chasing her mother's legacy) and Lil' Koch (I'll let you guess why) towards the end. And he was winning. He couldn't believe it. He was mostly trying to go out with a bang, although he did intend to destroy both parties on his way out.\n\nAnd he ended up winning.\n\nCome election day, it was Sanders (now at age 78 it had seemed he discovered the secret to immortality) running for the Democratic Bolshevik party (a party he created), Cruz running for the Christian party, Muhammed X running for the BLM party, of course, the Libertarian and Green parties, and Donald Trump, representing both Republican and Democrat votes. The results came in, and Donald Trump was the winner, followed by the Libertarian party, a close third the Green party, Cruz was a slightly distant 4th, then the Democratic Bolshevik party was 5th, and a dead last was the BLM party (which they declared imperialist racism).\n\nTrump spent his second term making the world great again, and when he left office, there was complete world peace. Working together with Sanders, Trump perfected the life-giving serum he dubbed Trumders, which was sold at a buck a vial, a vial that would extend your life 2 years. Eventually Sanders was given his own territory, where Sweden used to be (there was a year long period of severe civil unrest where several countries fell). There he set up his country, the People's Democratic Socialist Republic of Sweders, and expanded a bit into the rest of Europe.\n\nTrump was selected God-Emperor of the World by popular vote in 2044, and by 2155, the PDSRS fell as we expanded into the solar system. Trump would eventually give his life to prevent the Sun from collapsing, because due to his high energy, the sun would never blow up again. This also helped when the heat death of the universe came close, when Carson gave his life to spread his high energy throughout the universe.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n_I'm tired_"],["Politiburo is after me.\n\nI am richest man in all of Latvia.

It opened to reveal a trio of my specialty. \"The red potato. Renowned for its ability to retain its shape during the cooking process, perfect for frying and for stews. The blue potato. It's rich and silky texture and unusual color make it the royalty of all spuds. This, followed by the most famous and popular russet potato. Its fall apart nature makes it perfect as a thickener in soups, the large size is great for solid baking, and it can be sliced to make either chips or french fries.\"\n\nThe woman at the other side of the table blinked at me. She was covered in clear crystals, her speckled eyelashes catching the light in a beautiful manner as they blinked. Her hand delicately lifted and she pointed over at the box. \"You know those just grow in the ground, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yeah? Well so do diamonds, lady.\" I snapped back in an exasperated manner. \"I don't see how we're that much different.\"\n\n\"Whole industries run off my specialty.\" She lifted a brow, which created the finest of creases in her foundation caked forehead. \"I suppose that's true in your case as well, but I specialize in designer ring centerpieces for engagements and weddings. You just put the 'large' in the extra order of fries at McDonalds.\"\n\nI was about to say something, but her phone buzzed. She held up one hand and looked it over. Her wrist twisted about in the air and delicate crystals formed within it like ice. They shifted together until a large diamond appeared, with a red flaw within it in the shape of a heart.\n\n\"Mixed colored diamonds are all the rage nowadays anyways. And I just made three thousand dollars with six seconds worth of effort.\" She pulled out a velvet bag out of her purse and dropped the gemstone in it. Within the room, the clear sound of a bell rang and she picked up her drink as she stood. \"Good luck with your dirty little spud project.\" Her cocky sneer was what was most off putting about her, but I couldn't help but to tip my head and check out 'dat ass' as it shimmered back and forth towards the next table.\n\nI hardly noticed the small appearance of another woman joining me. She let out a nervous cough and I turned around to see a plain looking girl with a button up off-white blouse. The grimace I had on my face must've been quite noticeable, because she suddenly stiffened her posture and fumbled with her back. A handful of mints were taken out of a tin and stuffed into her mouth.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't you.\" A closed my potato box and put my elbow on the table, shifting my chin into my palm. \"Just some of the people here are terribly snobby.\"\n\n\"Yes, tell me about it.\" She looked down at the table and fumbled her hands together. \"The man at the previous table is a fashion designer specializing in silk products who just wouldn't stop about my choice of a polyester blend skirt and the table before that had a guy who lays high speed cables internationally. I forget what his talent is, maybe carbon fiber or something but it seemed like good work. I guess the high price it took to get into this speed dating lunch-in just brought out the high class people and those who grow root vegetables have no place here at all.\"\n\nShe must've seen what was in the box. \"Tch.\" I turn my head to the side and give a slight lean to see who I would be failing at drinking with next. It was a taller woman in blue who had cotton puff earrings and was having a heated discussion with the silk man. That would probably also be a bust. \"Potatoes are very important. One can eat a mostly potato diet and have nearly all of their nutritional needs.\"\n\nThe woman sitting with me widened her eyes. \"I completely understand. But other people's comments are just so terrible. You probably get tired of all the dirt covered jokes and how they just grow in the ground and everything.\"\n\nMy eyes drifted over to her, narrowing slightly. \"Yes.\" I said in a tone that dripped with venom, tightening my jaw in the process.\n\nHer hands lifted up and waved back and forth. \"I should've explained earlier, s-sorry!\" She delved into her purse and pulled out a wooden box, opening it up. \"My specialty is garlic. It's really difficult to get people to understand the differences in a Spanish Roja or a Chesnok Red. That I can understand, but they just don't seem to get that black garlic is very popular in high class cuisine and I do make a lot of money!\" Her browns furrowed and she seemed to be ranting for a second time since sitting down. \"And I keep telling them that I don't smell but they just always pinch their noses at me and say 'well I thought there was an off putting scent about you,' which makes absolutely no sense in my opinion. Garlic is covered for one, it doesn't have a strong smell at all until processed.\"\n\nI couldn't help but to have the corner of my mouth lift up at the sight of this small woman who was rather passionate about her talent. \"Stop...\" I lifted my head from my hand and sat back in my chair, gesturing towards her box. \"Tell me more about black garlic. Does it go well with a roasted potato?\"","I like this one to no end.  I would pick okra as my special talent.  Then again, someone who plants this stuff already does. ","Infinite loaded baked potatoes...","\"Here boy, take it,\" he said gruffly. The boy scurried over and snatched the tuber before darting off. The streets had gone astray in recent years. As famine let the worst come out in people, so did potatos. Their porous skin and all too starchy interiors laid waste to many men's colons.\n\nBards sang of colossal bowel movements, the size of two, perhaps three bushels of the things. Farms were amazed. They'd only been able to capitalize on one potato per plant, but using the special manure the potato-eaters produced made the potato flourish.\n\nThere were monumental stacks reaching higher than building as kids laughed and played, so it was very odd that a boy would come beg for one. The purpose, no doubt, was to stay away from the potato draft. He is young, his colon still green and lacking in experience to handle the potato shits. It takes a seasoned man to take the broad shape, with salt and pepper being the best combination.\n\nShould it be designated to a specific individual to control the potato market? Men thrived on them. The carbohydrates hooked them from their very DNA. There was a certain viciousness to the addiction, a bloodiness of sorts. It could not be controlled nor stopped once started. \n\nThe lust of potato grew weary on farmers as they plucked their bushels day in and day out, the plant not caring of the season. They worked, and plowed, and picked till the soil grew rot with malnutrition. It seemed the shits took more than they gave. \n\nThere were uprisings at first. Of course, few lasted as the hunger struck the rioters. There was little to be done as potato stock dwindled. Government officials were at a loss, their intestines tied with the vicious starchy goodness, too. Was there no superiority in these matters or civility? The potatoes did not discriminate their victims. The youth were held back by their mothers who sat writhing in potato agony, and here a man sat.\n\nHe controlled the potato market. His palms were black as night, subtle lines tracing themselves across his hands. When he saw fit, potatoes grew from his palm. The starving flocked from the streets to follow him in the fields as he ran his hand across the barren dirt. There was little to do but wait as night set in and each man picked a fledgling crop to lay around. They cradled it and sang to it as if it was the last of their line.\n\nHere he sat, starting to wonder what gifts he had outside of agriculture and humanities. There was more to life than plants. He knelt to the ground, his palms lying flat in front of him. The earth beneath his hands grew dark, spreading outward like a pool of blood. Rich soil rose up between his fingers, yet he did not move.\n\nHe balanced his way into a handstand, his hands pressing against the world as hard as his gift‚Äîthe potatoes‚Äîpressed within him. Bushels upon bushels of potatoes spawned from beneath his hands as the once sleeping foragers sprang into alertness. The soft sound of mashed potatos reached his ears. \n\nUp and up the bushels went, piling into the sky till the man reached the moon. He looked to his left and right for signs of life, but there was nothing. \n\n\"Let me find rest, a respite from the apparent. Potatoes in such quantity drain me,\" he spoke to no one. In fact, there was no sound the issued from his mouth. This made him wary. What strange place as the moon dared steal the words from his mouth?\n\nAgain he set his hands upon the world, this one a different celestial body, and readied himself. Bushels sprouted from places once thought inconceivable till they filled the very universe. Now he could speak, the potatoes acting as a medium for his voice to bounce against.\n\nThroughout his troubles of potation, he thought long on what his first words should be. His result became clear not long after. With a deep breath, savoring the hearty aroma of starch, he opened his mouth to speak the words of a new age.\n\n\"Potato.\"","hahaa I looooooove the ending\n","[removed]","\n#### Off Topic Comment Section ####\n\n---\n\nThis comment acts as a discussion area for the prompt.

","You can try a slow feeder bowl, or placing ping pong balls in the food to make them take more time to eat their food. I have a tripod who would scarf &amp; barf and because she is missing one of her front legs, a slow feeder bowl isn't optimal (they generally make the cats use a paw to dig out food, since she only has one front leg, that wasn't going to work).\n\nAnother thing is your cat may have anxiety or a medical issue like IBS. Trinity (the tripod) is taking a low maintenance dose of an anxiety medicine and now she doesn't scarf &amp; barf.\n\nThere are also timed release feeding bowls for dry food distribution which makes it easier if you do have to stick with 3 meals a day.","Eh he just scarfs food, some cats are like that.

I often thought my sister was home but then yell for her without a response. So I'd figure it was my cat.\n\nHe was very good about not getting up on furniture or counters.

Just gross black and white or random colors?","It still has to calculate geometry, you could have 1:1 perfect simmed physics of say for instance 2d particles, which is where plugins like x-particles and other point based physics systems come in.\nAs long as there is geometry and complex dynamics, the OP posted the non-rendered software display which doesn't look bad but it's not pretty. ","Simulation time refers to calculating the physics in one go and cache the simulation result to my RAM or Harddisk.

I can easily walk past 30 gigs and not bat an eye.\n\nPreviously I would have to close one set of things to make way for another set and waiting for 5-10 gigs worth of stuff to load off the harddisk and into programs is a pain when I might be flip flopping between projects a lot.\n\nP.S.

How did you learn about blender and how to use it? 2. What hardware is best to render something like your simulation? Thanks","Learning a program like Blender is kinda like trying to learn a game like World of Warcraft, except you start at level 100 and there wasn't a tutorial.\n\nYou have to strip it down to the basics and take it in bite sized pieces like how the interface works, how to manipulate objects in 3D space, etc.\n\nThe best way to do this is to simply set yourself small incremental goals and use Blender a lot. Watch tutorials and copy them. [This is a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHVYYMG3QVY); in the lower left corner it shows which hotkeys he uses and can give you a good idea of what features and keys get used most for moving objects and the camera around.\n\nWhen you get stuck try finding more specific info or tutorials about that issue, sometimes if you're **really** stuck, looking up the methods behind a feature can help, for example what does rigid body actually mean? what does convex hull collision mean?\n\nThe good news though, computer simulations are better-suited to work with very simple 3D models. Minimalistic designs can still be very good looking.\n\nAs for rendering, I used Blender's Cycles renderer which allows ray-tracing to be done on my graphics card. nVidia was the fastest at rendering and supported the most render features for a while but I hear AMD is catching up. Although rendering on your CPU isn't the end of the world if it's relatively new and high-end.\n\nMaking a render look *nice* is actually a skill-set itself separate from how technically good your render is(just look at the original Toy Story). Looking at references like how professionals light products or general real life lighting tutorials can mesh well with learning how lights work and look good inside a 3D program.\n\nLearning something new will always be frustrating but eventually the payoff will outweigh the pain. Hope this was helpful. :D","Thanks man really appreciate the reply will try this out.","\"Learning a program like Blender is kinda like trying to learn a game like World of Warcraft, except you start at level 100 and there wasn't a tutorial.\"\nI was a java web application programmer before I retired, which is probably one of, if not the most complicated system to learn.

But big buildings is going to be a looong while off. \n\nThe best option for things like that is split the building into bunches of bricks, you'd get better performance but it won't look as good.(it's essentially big bricks)\n\nAlternatively, \"build\" the buildings out of something bigger. I'd suggest some sort of panelling, but then you need to consider indentations from other rigid bodies. \n\nThere's too many variables to say for sure.","Rust is kind of like that.","Actually a real-time specialized physics engine could probably do this fast enough to build gameplay around it.\n\nAn example that comes close is a game called [Besiege](http://store.steampowered.com/app/346010/)\n\nMy tank by itself without the broken ground or the 5000 brick building simulates at 23 frames per second and could probably go faster with some optimization.\n\nBig game companies ignore massive physics because\n\n* console CPU power isn't going to get faster for a while\n* it's very hard to sync so many object over multiplayer","I have besiege.

Though the tank took longer to make work it's still very simple (really, look at the .blend file. it's just hinges and motors).\n\nThe real reason people like my animation is because of the presentation and rendering like 60FPS to make it smooth, vivid colors so people click the thumbnail, not having any dead time at beginning or end to make it easy to watch over and over again.\n\nBut the fact still stands that if it were only the tank with nothing to crash into it would be 'so-so'.

Good ones have characters that work on two levels, one where they're amazingly stereotypical, and one where they're really fleshed out and have long running motivations that you can read into if you pay attention. \n\nBut really, it seems like every show with multiple writers and a decently sized cast does that. Star Trek almost always had a big enough cast that some characters are just around to fulfill their stereotype and then get out of the way of a story. Kirk runs into an injured life form, waves over McCoy, who scans it with the tricorder, frowns, says something, Kirk doesn't get it, Spock gets it and makes a comment, Kirk keeps looking confused, McCoy explains better, Kirk understands, asks if McCoy can do anything, \"Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a _\" and then Kirk runs off to shoot/punch/screw somebody/thing. \n\nThere, I just described roughly a quarter of the original series. I could do the same with Ponies (to a lesser extent as the series went on), but I could do the same with House (\"It's never lupus\"), or any of a ton of other formulaic shows like that. The characters take their turns developing behind their stereotypes, but the stereotypes don't change much. That's just the nature of most TV, and even the shows which attempt to avoid that kind of slice-of-life-ness seem about evenly split between older and younger audiences. \n\nEdit: I guess the full sequence actually has Spock explain what McCoy said, and then Kirk goes \"but what does that have to do with _?\", and then McCoy drops the bombshell plot twist, and then Kirk asks if McCoy can do anything..., or there's a commercial break.

As well there is one about not taking up false idols. Atheists who \"worship\" other things such as money and power and such, in a roundabout way, could be considered a sin. Yes.\n\nThe Christians who got it right are the ones who realize the point of a concept of sin: we are sinful in everything we do, because we are human, and we have free will, which means inevitably we will all sin and sin again.\n\nOr something. I dunno. I stopped going to church a long time ago, but the Bible has some pretty cool books in it that are written masterfully, if you really look at it objectively.","\"Using the Lord's name in vain\" is referring to blasphemy, and the worship of idols is also in the 10 commandments, but one can argue what worship is very easily.","oh yea, many years of sunday school taught me a lot of ways that things can be skewed just a bit :-p\n","There's more than just 10 commandments. .","Well, if you believe unbelief in a deity is a sin, then my short dialog is exactly right. It's especially egregious to punish an honest belief of the brain, a mental state arrived at through inquiry.","I don't personally believe unbelief is a sin. I think if there could ever be such a being that is anything close to Jesus that ever existed, he would have wanted us to ask questions and explore the world he gave us. I never really understood the \"contemporary\" portrayal of Jesus/God to be a wrathful one, or a narcissitic one.\n\nThe core message of the new testament, to me, is one that preaches acceptance and cautionary thought. I don't believe life was gifted to us so we would spend it in a temple worshiping the Lord. I think a lot of those concepts were invented by man to shape behavior long ago, hence why most of that stuff is in the old testament.\n\nI believe that we are all here to just enjoy the ride, man. And Jesus was just saying, like, be good and be good to each other, because man, it's a drag when you waste your time punishing those who you think are wrong, and so on. Jesus' sacrifice isn't a \"get out of jail free\" card for sinners, it's supposed to be a wakeup call... Like, \"HEY! Chill out and enjoy what you have, because look how BAD it can get.\"\n\nBut that's just me. I would identify as an agnostic over anything. Most atheists I know seem to really feed off of having to be right about everything. But then again, so do most Christians I know. So it goes.","Everyone is born with original sin, so everyone not a Christian is unredeemed. It's just bullshit; they're making up a problem that only they can solve.","No it's not. The point is that you cannot *not* do sin in your everyday life. Then, with differing requirements in different branches of Christianity, you can be brought to heaven or left to the abyss or hell or whatever, which again depends on your preferred choice of religion.\n\nPersonally, I'd go for protestant branches (most if not all I think) that only require for you to ask for forgiveness (even with your dying breath, if you actually believe it) for you to go into heaven, the alternative being just an eternity of nothingness.","That seems like semantics. It's still a punishment that it exists. My God would never even allow this eternal damnation as a possibility. ","Once had a lady tell me I'm going to hell because I don't believe in Jesus. I really didn't know what to say.","Your going to a place you don't believe in because you don't believe in it.","T: You're going to Hell forever unless you mentally think \"come into my heart, Jesus.\"\n\nM: What if I don't think there's sufficient evidence to believe any of that?\n\nT: Then he'll torture you forever and ever for all eternity.\n\nM: Why the fuck would he do that?\n\nT: Because he loves you, bitch","T: You're going to Hell forever unless you mentally think \"come into my heart, Jesus.\"\n\nM: What if I don't think there's sufficient evidence to believe any of that?\n\nT: Then he'll torture you forever and ever for all eternity.\n\nM: Why the fuck would he do that?\n\nT: Because he loves you, bitch.","yup, makes sense to me. \n\n/s","TLDR; I overreacted a lot at the miniature religious conflict in the comments. Anyways here is a unwarranted rant asking the redditors here to respect other people's beliefs and not be jerks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt pains me to see the infamous atheism v. religion conflict break out here in the comments over such silliness. Why should we berate and belittle our fellows if their beliefs differ from ours? For self-validation at the expense of others? While this post is mainly directed at those who have posted hateful comments, I would like to ask all here to be more tolerant, respectful, and understanding of others' beliefs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBefore I continue, you should know that I AM a christian, and such my view will be biased in that way and christian morality and tenets (or at least my version of it) will seep into this post. Additionally, will not be able to meaningfully discuss other religions within this post. However, I will try my best to remain objective. Afterall, it is not only the nonreligious I am writing to, but also my brothers in Christ.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs a christian I must say proselyting, at it's most basic level, is a righteous action, if awkward. But there is no reason to go on a crusade! Aggressive Defensiveness and disdain towards the nonreligious is unwarranted, even when Christianity is under attack. At the end, it is up to the individual to decide what he or she beliefs in and whether or not to accept God; we may be able to convince them in one direction but we cannot force them. It is their choice alone to make. Christianity's tenets call for love and respect of neighbors, thus, we should act as Christians. It proves much better for proselyting.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo the nonreligious and atheists; some posts here have been very aggressive towards religious values. Is it necessary to prove that God is fake? Does atheism, like Christianity, require people to be converted to it's cause for their own good? People find solstice in religion; the hope that life for them and their love ones will extend past death, the comfort of a heavenly hand guiding them through turbulent times, the peace that comes from believing that humanity is not just another blip in the universe, that their lives are not meaningless, but rather that they have a important place within the world given to them by the loving deity who had placed them into existence. Why rob this amenity from them by arousing doubt, or risk their zeal by insulting them?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI would like to point out that it is impossible to disprove or prove the extensive of a God (or gods.) Man cannot, especially the modern man, explore and fully comprehend all existence and anything else that might also exist. If a deity initiated the start of this universe, then retreated to another universe - a universe inaccessible in all ways to mankind - immediately afterward and did nothing these billions of years, could we prove the god's existence? Absolutely not. However, it would be incorrect to say that the god does not exist. Thus, while religions certainly make more assumptions, both Christianity and atheism are faiths; based on things that can not be concretely proven. Until the end times proves otherwise, only the righteous will be \"right.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI cannot fathom that a loving God could condemn anyone to eternal torture and death, even though as sinners we deserve it. It is my biggest doubt in Christianity. I desperately hope that God will draw all to him and save all of us during the end times, and the lake of fire a scare tactic merely to get us on the Christian path early. I ask you, please do not give God reason to condemn anyone. You can debate for your side, but do not be hateful. Respect others beliefs, be tolerant, and, for the love of God, love thy neighbor. ","If you donate 5$ to spacex I will permenantly not give a shit about your beliefs.","Atheism is not a faith system.  It's not believing in any deity. \n\n And while  it us impossible  to disprove the existence of a God (arguably,  since we can use the same logic and attribute it to any mythical being)  it can be quite easy to disprove the existence of the god/s proposed in the various Holy books that exist today.  \n","Some atheists seriously get their knickers in a knot when you describe atheism as a belief system that there is no god.","It's like kids arguing about whether black is a colour.","T: man is selfish and greedy so he is unable to enter a place of absolute holiness without being made holy through the sacrifice of Christ.\n\nM: what if I don't think there's sufficient evidence to believe any of that?\n\nT: since he loves you he has given you thousands of years of written testimony from dozens of sources, verbal testimony of changed lives, and the miracles he has performed as an incarnate man so that, hopefully, you will recognize your unholiness and ask him to make you holy so that you aren't cast out of his presence and into a place of evil void of anything good.\n\nM: why the fuck would he do that?\n\nT: because he loves you.","Everyone born before Jesus is going to Hell!üé§","\"Abraham trusted God and his faith was counted to him as righteousness.\"\n\nBoom. Saved.","But Abraham Lincoln was born after Jesus, stupid!","Good point.","So did the earlier Greco-Roman folk. They trusted their gods. They should be fine.","\"They were wrong so everyone is wrong\"?  Strong logic.","Who says they were wrong? You have no proof.\n\nUnfounded assumptions from yourself right there.
