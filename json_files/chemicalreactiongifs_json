The water is in fact not colorless; even pure water is not colorless, but has a slight blue tint to it, best seen when looking through a long column of water. The blueness in water is not caused by the scattering of light, which is responsible for the sky being blue. Rather, water blueness comes from the water molecules absorbing the red end of the spectrum of visible light. To be even more detailed, the absorption of light in water is due to the way the atoms vibrate and absorb different wavelengths of light.

It's just two different alloys.

The conventional way is to cut the stock 3/4 of the way through, fold it back on itself and faggot weld an inch of it to form the point. Some claimed that this wasn't the strongest way of welding and advocated for a scarfed weld.\n\nSomeone did some testing with a 12mm faggot welded poker and was able to hang 400lb's worth of anvil from the welded hook with no sign of failiure. The exact same discussion was had, that technically the scarfed weld would be stronger, but it's a goddamn fire poker!

If you leave a blade mostly hard, it will take a finer edge and take much longer to get dull, but it also leaves it brittle. If you temper it at a higher temperature you make the steel softer, but tougher. Kitchen knives are usually incredibly hard for their size (especially high end Japanese style) because it gives much better performance for it's intended use, while cleavers and camp knives are expected to endure shock loads and are tempered softer.

The pattern you see is how the two dissimilar steels join up... how they're distributed.  You can see it very faintly without the etching, but it doesn't show up well on camera.  There are many different patterns of damascus you can make.  Modern damascus is forge welded steel.  The old kind is something else entirely -- it's a bit confusing.  The last example here will show the original stuff.\n\n\nThe modern stuff is made by taking two steels, folding them over and over again, and forge welding it all together... reall high temps, more than regular forging temps.

To the layman, probably not a noticeable difference, but a difference none the less. This also varies depending on which steels are forge welded to create the Damascus.","deadly poison increases your attack by 2, so its stronger","The acid wont do anything unless its undiluted and the blade sits there for weeks.  The only thing its doing is causing an oxidation barrier on the higher carbon steels mqking them darker but not on the higher nickle content steels.  How ever damascus or pattern welded steel has a single flaw which is very serious. It's called delamination.  This occurs when the steel isnt welded properly and the layers start to come undone. ","The acid shouldn't weaken the blade any.  Consider it a surface deep chemical attack on the steel.  You can usually remove an acid etch with a quick buff of the surface.  In industry, this is commonly called acid etching.  We use it all the time to pull out visual representations of weld joint macro and micro structures for examination.  It's incredibly useful for repairs as well.  ","If the steel is forged and folded like the layers are revealed, it should have a better structure, but it depends how the forging was cooled and how many layers, that were folded.\n\nBut I think this more of an aesthetic thing, when buying knives.\n\n","Nowadays Damascus steel isn't really that special, but in medieval times it was arguably the best steel in the world (arguably as it's likely the Japanese Katana was superior but there's no recorded instance of them meeting).  To give you an idea, when someone wielding a Damascus blade came up against your average English Knight, it wasn't all that uncommon for the knights blade to straight up be cut in half by the Damascus one.  ","&gt; To give you an idea, when someone wielding a Damascus blade came up against your average English Knight, it wasn't all that uncommon for the knights blade to straight up be cut in half by the Damascus one.\n\nI'm gonna call bullshit on that, unless you can give me a source. Also, Japanese steel was not better. As /u/HuffsGOldStars said, it was folded so many times because the materials were not as good as western steel. This is why western blacksmiths don't have the same tradition of folding steel, because they did not need it.","You are correct on all counts.\n\nAlso,  I'm going to point out something  (and, really this bothers the shit out of me). What we call \"Damascus\" steel today ***ISN'T*** really true Damascus steel. It's forged like it, but the actual formula for the base steel is still unknown.  It seems to me, that there's an additive that we're missing.  \n\nNo shit, I honestly think it's something stupid simple that we just overlook because it's so simple and obvious.  Zirconium Oxide comes to mind. Why? Sand. There is a lot of fucking sand in the Middle East.  I believe that it is possible that a bit of sand worked its way into some of the ore as they smelted it and wound up folding the steel as a means to make up for it and even things out a bit, only to stumble upon something better than what they had before.  That would explain the nano-tube structure they find on surviving pieces.\n\nWith regards to the accounts from the Crusades pertaining to Damascus Steel being able to cut through lesser metals... Obviously bunk. Exaggerated to make themselves the underdogs. But, it is possible that it was strong enough to bite into and sharply dent other swords (like, swinging a cheaply made stainless steel sword onto a piece of rebar)","Umm, I think you're conflating a few things. First, you're correct that what we call damascus steel in modern parlance is more technically called pattern welded steel. However they are NOT forged the same in the slightest. Damascus steel traditionally referred to a crucible cast steel from India with an extremely high carbon content that was cast, allowed to slowly cool, then forged at a very low heat so as not to dissolve the carbide structures that formed in the steel upon initially cooling. Pattern welded steel on the other hand is simply two or more pieces of steel that are welded together and formed to shape, the Japanese did this to even out carbon content in their extremely poor iron ore and the Vikings did it to show off their craftsmanship. Now on to the properties of damascus, damascus (also known as wootz) was the absolute cutting edge of steel technology *for the time* and really only for small knives. When compared to any modern steel it is completely outstripped in every way, true damascus is extremely soft, doesn't take a very acute edge, and is fairly useless for anything but a small knife. Also, people tend to mystify true damascus as some sort of ancient lost hocus-pocus when in fact it was rediscovered how to make it way back in the 80's! If you have a furnace at home (easy to make) you can even make it yourself. And as for the \"carbon nano-tubes\" part? Yeah, any time you get graphite you're going to have carbon nano-tubes, bucky balls, and other similar structures form randomly, but this also happens in cast iron and for some reason no one ever suggests that would make a good weapon... Carbon nano-tubes are even found in soot from your fireplace, it's seriously EVERYWHERE, but it makes a good headliner and gets spread about much like the myths about katanas. Anyways, this turned into a book but I hope it helped clear some things up for you! ","I'd read that the whole reason that Japanese swordsmiths folded the steel so much was because the quality of Japanese iron ore was shit. They didn't have to fold it so much elsewhere because the iron in those places was much better.","now sell it on steam","It's a stattracker!","Surprisingly, some of the CSGO knives are worth more than their real life counterparts.","Most have been for ages.","how is that surprising? knives aren't rare in real life","same with cs:go, everyone has 2 knives","I see what you did there.

The recipe for true, traditional, real Damascus steel has been lost to time, for lack of a better description.","It still is. This is called Damascus steel because of the pattern","We know a lot about what the steel is made of. But to date, nobody has been able to replicate the forging methods to recreate the pattern you see in Damascus steel artifacts. They may have used folding, but true Damascus blades are not pattern welded. The patterns are actually a result of the way the trace elements interacted with carbon throughout the forging process. \n\nSomething similar can be achieved through pattern welding (though it isn't quite as impressive looking, imo), but anything you see today that is advertised as \"Damascus\" is really Damascus-patterned. Not true Damascus steel.\n\nThat doesn't mean modern pattern welded blades don't take an impressive amount of time and skill to produce. They do. And the one in this post is absolutely amazing looking. But labeling it \"Damascus\" is a bit misleading.","Not really, people make it out to be far more mysterious than it really is! Pattern welding or crucible steel almost certainly cover how it was made, we just can't categorically prove it.","We can make pretty a near copy of what it was. We just don't know how they did it. ","Ferric Chloride can also be used to etch copper plates in printmaking. Fun fact: it's not actually an acid but it gets the job done.","Further fun: FeCl3 may not be a Brønsted acid but it is a Lewis acid, and it forms hydronium when made into an aqueous solution, so... it is an acid. ","Did not know that, but now I do !!!","and for making circuit boards","What's the enchantment on that?","Time for some clarifications on misconceptions, because this is not *real* Damascus steel.\n\nThe steel you see above if pattern welded steel, it comes from a process where multiple layers of steel are welded together, then forged to produce a pattern affect that resembles Damasacus steel. \n\nThe process of making *real* Damascus steel (also known as wootz steel) has been lost to us. We can scan old Damascus steel blades to determine their chemical composition (learning what had been used to originally), but we can't figure out how it was smelted in production. \n\nWhen steel cools its molecules align in specific ways that allow it to have different properties; very fast cooling will leave the steel very hard but also very brittle, very slow cooling leaves the steel less hard but also less brittle. In sword fights you didn't want your sword to shatter in battle so this second type was preferred.\n\nDamascus steel seemed to defy those rules though, it was both very hard and flexible; which is why it was very popular and well known. And whatever process that was used to create it left an odd wavy pattern on it. We still have no idea how Damascus steel was made, but we keep finding new properties about it like carbon nanotubes inside the steel's cdystal steuctures.\n\nModern pattern welded steel resembles Damasacus steel, so people have taken to calling it that; but because pattern welded steel isn't a singular piece of steel this modern replica isn't as strong as a singular piece od similar steel would be. So it's very much the opposite of the steel it's ancestral name derivates from, but because people still associate the name Damascus with quality these blades can be sold with a large price increase.\n\nIf you're interested in how steel gets different qualities based on the environment it was formed in, or had any other questions feel free to pm me. I'm a chemical engineer who has been researching this subject with my free time, in the hope to one day bring the real Damascus steel back to this world.","You should probably learn some metallurgy first before you go about reinventing the wheel. You're talking out your ass if you're claiming pearlite makes a superior blade to properly tempered martensite. Also, do a little more research on wootz maybe? It should only take a couple seconds to find out it has already been successfully remade.  \n  \nhttp://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/9809/Verhoeven-9809.html","Maybe you should read the article you link (because I have read it). They believe that they can recreate Damascus sttel ignots, but the ignots they create all suffer from the same flaw, they can't be forged into blades by blacksmiths.\n\nSome would believe that this indicates that we've lost the forging process, but I find it much more likely that the process of creating the ignots, discussed in this article is not the original way Damascus was made.","That's not what that said at all, and if you look the article disproves you since they actually did forge a blade as part of the experiment. The damascus steel is hot short, which means forging it at usual forging temperatures causes it to crumble. This matches the accounts of smiths in France/England who bought raw ingots and attempted to make their own knives out of it. Hot shortness is simply a function of the high carbon content and is similar to cast iron in that regards. The paper outlined two different methods of forging the ingots.  \n\n1. Get the ingot well above usual forging temperatures, let a thick decarburized skin form on it, and forge to shape. Then normalize the blank multiple times to reintroduce the carbide banding.  \n\n2. Forge the ingot at a dull red heat, this is probably the way it was actually done. Damascus steel iron ore naturally contained high levels of phosphorus which contributes to ductility at low heat.  \n  \nIf you actually are a chemical engineer your lack of reading comprehension is scary to say the least.

But based on that show demascus is shit compared to just normal modern quality steel. ","I guess gloves aren't a consideration when working with sharp knives or acid etchers?","Safety third, or maybe fourth.","Knife makers don't tend to wear gloves as they are very dangerous around any kind of rotary tool, which is what 90% of the work is done on.","Yeah but this isn't a rotary tool, it's a container full of caustic chemicals. There's no reason not to wear gloves in this situation. ","Ferric chloride isn't all that bad to get on your hands, it can cause some irritation, but for the most part you'll be fine, don't try to wash your hands in it though, it'll stain just about anything it touches and it's notoriously hard to clean off.","The band aids from the previous incidents are all the protection he needs","I don't really like that it's called Damascus steel.

Many knife makers simply buy a billet and grind it back (stock removal) and never forge it. Forging involves forming steel by moving it, normally with a hammer, stock removal involves removing material to shape it.","it's kind of both. Welding makes two (or more) pieces of metal into one piece of metal via heat, and forging is reshaping &amp; tempering via heat. This blade started off as multiple pieces of steel, and the forging process welds them together. \n\nThis is a simplification, and I'm not an expert, but the overall concept should be accurate enough. :)","I want a straight razor like this.

I just think that something that was a major deal in the old world being rediscovered would be a little more well known, and not be listed as a Lost Art.","Why would it be? There were a couple of articles written in the 80's when it was rediscovered, but bottom line it's a mediocre steel at best. Keep in mind most of the mythical claims about it were just that, mythical. Most of the stories you hear about it originated with the Persian traders who were trying to drive up the price enough to justify carting them across a continent. The modern equivalent, Talonite, absolutely blows it out of the water in every way. ","For multiple reasons. Namely, it's a lost art. A utility that had been the most significant thing in the area. It was more than just weapons. It was farming tools, butcher's knives, and in some cases, even cookware. \n\nKnowing the actual formula is more than just having the ability to recreate it. It's a glimpse into the ancient world. How they got the materials needed to formulate it, how it worked in their economy.  You keep going on about the \"mythical\" properties, but if the real thing was as shit as you say, it wouldn't have been so widely used and for such a long time.","I never said it was shit, *for the time*! You have to remember, most people in Europe didn't have access to good steel, and vanadium (the alloy the ore in India naturally contained) is an extremely good grain refiner, deep hardener, and carbide former. But compared to any modern tool steel of the last 100 years? Yeah it's shit. You are underestimating just how much the Bessemer Process and it's ability to precisely control alloy content in the 1850's changed steel technology. Before Bessemer your choice was either cast iron, or wrought iron unless you wanted to pay out the nose or buy from the Swiss (their iron ore had EXTREMELY low sulfur and phosphorus content) but afterwards you could turn out literally tons of steel at a time with exacting alloy contents and no contaminants. Also, could you link these bowls and utensils? I've only really heard it used for knives, swords, and a couple pieces of armor for very rich people. ","Also, Damascus steel wasn't produced in the middle east, it was produced in India. Europeans called it Damascus steel because it came up the Damascus trading road. ","Nova did an episode on Damascus blades a while back which is where i heard this statistic.  I'll see if I can track it down.  Basically the long and short of it is Damascus blades where made, surprise surprise, in Damascus.  There was a period of a few hundred years where Damascus was putting out Damascus steel blades and then suddenly the secret was lost and no one knew why.  It was eventually discovered (eventually meaning relatively recent, 10-15 years iirc) that the secret was iron containing trace amounts of... some element i can't remember off the top of my head.  Anyway, there was a mine near Damascus where all the iron contained some of the stuff, and that's how Damascus Steel was first forged in the first place.  The reason the secret was lost was the mine went dry.  Anyway, this extra element made the swords super strong.  Nowadays we have a better understanding of the actual chemical composition of steel and exactly what elements it takes to make it stronger, but back then they were just tossing charcol and iron into a furnace and hoping.  They could hold a finer edge than British blades, and Damascus Steel blades were famed for \"being able to cut a silk scarf in half as it fell to the ground\" which was not something western blades could do.  All that said, what we know as Damascus Steel today, still isn't exactly the same so it's likely there's some additive we're missing.  Comparison with genuine Damascus Blades to todays modern versions see a noticeable drop in quality compared to the old ones.\n\nYou're misunderstanding.  Yes the quality of the initial steel was terrible.  But the resulting blade could hold an edge far finer than anything westerners could come up with.  Good British blades could cut a man in half with a single swing.  Katana's however were actually measured buy how much they could cut, and merely cutting through one body would be a terrible sword.  The japanese sword testers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tameshigiri) would cut through straw, cadavers (fake bodies basically), or even convicted criminals in order to test out the swords.  A sword worth buying would need to be able to cut through at least 3 people, and the really good ones were upwards of 5.","&gt; Nowadays Damascus steel isn't really that special, but in medieval times it was arguably the best steel in the world\n\nYou comparing entirely two different things. Damascus Steel today is a completely different product then what you are historically referring to. Damascus steel hasn't been produced in hundreds of years. The present day \"Damascus Steel\" blades are just stealing the popular name and that is all they have in common. [Source](http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/9809/verhoeven-9809.html) and more info on the blades themselves.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the technique of producing wootz Damascus steel blades is a lost art. The date of the last blades produced with the highest-quality damascene patterns is uncertain, but is probably around 1750; it is unlikely that blades displaying low-quality damascene patterns were produced later than the early 19th century. Debate has persisted in the metallurgy community over the past 200 years as to how these blades were made and why the surface pattern appeared.6-8 Research efforts over the years have claimed the discovery of methods to reproduce wootz Damascus steel blades,9-12 but all of these methods suffer from the same problem—modern bladesmiths have been unable to use the methods to reproduce the blades. \"","I go more into that in my reply to the other guy.","Probably because of copyright issues ","wat","#PROBABLY BECAUSE OF COPYRIGHT ISSUES \n***\n\n##[^^^I ^^^am ^^^a ^^^bot, ^^^and ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^respond ^^^to ^^^myself.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CantHearYouBot/)","different time zones.

It works well, but damn is it big(and probable expensive). ","Idk, I counted about 10 seconds from start of peeling to pieces falling off. That's 6 apples per minute. 360 apples per hour. If you're paying a worker 10 dollars per hour to peel and core and slice 3 apples per minute (extremely optimistic estimate, although im making shit up here) you're paying ~5.5 cents per apple. If the machine costs 750 dollars  and 15 cents per hour to run, it basically pays for itself after 40,000 apples (by my drunk math that I was unable to recount how i arrived at the conclusion to), or 120 hours of use. Of course the amount you're profiting off of the cored and peeled apples affects this too but excluding that I'm fairly confident that my math is wrong. If anyone wants to correct me go ahead, but until then I'm pretty sure this machine is a great investment. Assuming the machine needs a person feeding it apples this starts to fall apart but i'm sure an apple-feeding machine exists for some other purpase already that we can use to complicate this equation even more","Your calculation is wrong. It may take roughly 10-12 seconds to peel a single apple, but the machine is doing 3 apples in parallel. I counted 4 seconds between him putting each apple on(which is where I got 12 sec from, 3*4). That means it can do 15 apples per min, much faster than a person. It is surely cost effective, it is just is big as hell too. ","i mean what kkind of use do you have for an industrial (can we pump more power into it to speed it up? i'm sure you could increase the motor speed and potentially profit per time spent running with a better motor) apple peeling/coring machine where the space it occupies is going to be a limiting concern? im not making this argument from a household perspective, unless someone's mom is trying to peel the next year woht of apples for them in a single night, in which case the space issue is likely a nonfactor again regardless. if i owned a business that needed apples cored and peeled and could sell them faster than my employees could peel them i would definitely be investing in this. who knows","Yah, it would have to be an extreme need. But if the business needed 900 apples peeled an hour, this would do it. I feel like it would take 5-10 workers to do it by hand.  ","Nah, the machine is a gimmick, no kitchen would buy this.  it's largely automated but importantly it still needs a PERSON to load the apples. You're not saving on labour.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj2I3TlqoDY\n\nBack in the good old days I'd use a machine like this to peel my apples.  I'd do a box of apples a day for various deserts but mostly plain pies, cobblers and danishes, with a portion set aside for ice cream or other desert combos. I'm just guessing here, my memory is foggy going back that far, but I think it was about 75 apples a box, and I'd finish that in about 5-7 minutes.  After you're done all that I'd end up with an extra step where i'd go over them with a knife, sometimes rough, sometimes precise, depending on whatever needs were.  that would only take an extra 1-2 minutes.\n\nthat's probably between 7 and 9 apples a minute.  At that rate I couldn't really go more than 10 minutes but it seems about right to my recollection.  The tool I used probably cost about $40, Canadian.  They tend to last if you care for them too.\n\nedit: reviewing that video the person went really really slow and was set up w/ mip all wrong.  I got really good at using it and you kind of settle into a quick rhythm, there's even a little trick kind of when you slide the screw back with the right speed and finesse and the core flies off in the same direction more or less where you set your bin up to collect the peels.  Of course, every now and then you get a ripe bit that just won't co-operate but i bet that kind of thing would muck up the OP's machine too.","how hard would it be to repurpose an existing machine and modify it slightly to be able to load the machines up. If you had 100 of these machines and 3 or 4 people supervising an automated system that would load these apples into a machine (we're assuming that you already have people loading the apples for the machine's human counterpart to begin with) i can easily see the machines being more efficient. How many apples can a \"professional\" corer/peeler do per hour, and with 100% efficiency (no breaks, no slowing down as the day moves on, etc)?\n\n\nAlso, no offense, but i do not believe for a moment that any human is capable of *peeling* and *coring* and *slicing* 75 apples in 5 minutes. That's the most ludicrous thing I've heard in my life. That's beyond steph curry of apples territory. Beyond michael jordan. Even anything close to that. I will personally pay for someone's box of apples three times over if they can show me an unedited video of them coring and peeling and slicing 75 apples of uniform perfect quality and equal slice sizes (8 slices per apple). You can't fucking produce that video. It's fucking inhuman. The guy in the video spent more than 10 seconds peeling the apple alone. You triple that speed and you still barely have 5 seconds to cut and core the apple and start the next one. And you're absolutely sacrificing quality at that point. Show me the videwo","I don't have a video of my regular successes from that long ago, nobody had cameras on their phone like now then.  You don't core the apple, the machine does it.  The guy in the link I posted showed the function, but not the capability. You don't sac quality, the machine cuts it to uniform width!  I might only have to worry about clean slices on the apple-slinky for like 10% that would be used as sides for icecream etc, the rest of it would go inside pies or whatever and could be rough chopped.  You don't wanna believe it, i'm not gonna convince you, sorry. This was also only for 10 minutes sprint, not 8 hours a day like it was a shift.","Its easly 15 apples a min, count the seconds between each apple he puts on. Its about 4 sec. 60/4=15.
