","\"Internet customers in the UK are prohibited from accessing a range of web sites by default, because they have their Internet access filtered by their ISPs. The filtering program has applied to new ISP customers since the end of 2013, and has been extended to existing users on a rolling basis. A voluntary code of practice agreed by all four major ISPs[8] means that customers have to 'opt out' of the ISP filtering to gain access to the blocked content.[9] However, the complex nature of the active monitoring systems means that users cannot usually opt out of the monitoring and re-routing of their data traffic, something which may render their data security vulnerable. The range of content blocked by ISPs can be varied over time.[10] Categories blocked across the major ISPs include: Dating, Drugs, Alcohol and Tobacco, File sharing, Gambling, Games, Pornography, Nudity, Social networking, Suicide and Self-harm, Weapons and violence, Obscenity, Criminal Skills, Hate, Media Streaming, Fashion and Beauty, Gore, Cyberbullying, Hacking and Web-blocking circumvention tools.\"\n\nYou can technically opt-out if you're an adult.

It sounds like 90% of the internet is blocked.","IIRC you're given options to decide what exactly you want to block, like a firewall of sorts. Porn/nudity I believe is blocked by default if you don't say anything to your ISP. But from a previous article I read, the ISPs are suppose to notify you if a filter is going into effect and what do you want to do about it (for customers prior to 2013).

David Cameron first announced such legislation in July 2013[31][32] but default filtering was rejected at the September 2013 conference of the Liberal Democrats (the Coalition Government's minor partner)[33] and no Government legislation to this effect occurred during the 2010-15 Parliament.\"\n\n[Another says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_blocking_in_the_United_Kingdom#Mobile_Internet_blocking): \"All major UK [mobile] operators now voluntarily filter content by default.\"\n","&gt;They can't really block them as so many businesses rely on them.\n\nThats actually a good reason **to** block them -- so you can upsell people who just want to work from home on overpriced 'business packages' that they should not need.","Mothers are worthless.","Literally all hitlers.\n\n","\"wow thats what its like in america?? haha us british gentlemen have it *SO* much better here!\" ","The nanny state at its finest!","Fuck that shit.

Even if you opt out, you are stuck with the overhead of a few table lookups on giant tables (which likely aren't in an optimized SQL database at ALL).

The adult section isn't just nudie mags, it's anything that they deem to be offensive or bad in any way, including a lot of stuff you think is perfectly fine and innocent.  The adult section is clearly labeled but is right there with everything else and there is no stigma attached to going into it, because everybody knows the library is overzealous in what they label \"adult\".\n\nThat's the internet.  You can access anything and everything, and you are perfectly capable of deciding what you don't want to see, and you usually know ahead of time based on the link description or other factors, about what types of stuff you'll find.\n\nNow imagine the library doesn't just move the adult section, they hide it behind the counter, and video record you, and log each access, and you just feel awkward going in.  And lots of people come in and don't even know that it's there and so they don't even know to ask about it.  They are blocked from seeing information without knowing.  And less people go browsing there because it just feels more dirty to do it now.\n\nThat is a fundamental change in behavior that was created by the censorship.  Before that, people browsed freely and didn't think twice.  Now they are missing information, sometimes without knowing it, and when they find out and want to access it, they are burdened and recorded and made to feel like it's somehow different and somehow wrong.\n\nIt is a *chilling effect* on how you think and act.\n\nIn an opt-in system, the *default* is freedom, the ability to access what you want without burden or hassle or shame, you are choosing to place restrictions upon yourself for your own benefit, because you are an adult capable of making your own decisions.  In an opt-out system, you are treated as a child and that needs to be cared for, and it is specifically designed to make the social taboo and default be that access to this content is not appropriate.  It is control and manipulation.","Why do you think the internet should be treated differently from the real world?","First, I'm curious where in my post I make any points that require the internet be different from the real word.  I disagree with a lot of real world censorship as well.\n\nThat said, you are correct, and I do think the internet should be treated differently, because it fundamentally *is* different.  The internet has the ability to be even *more* open and free than the real world, and even though that comes with some bad things, on the whole, it's a HUGE net benefit to society at large.\n\nBad people will always use technology to do bad things, but that doesn't make the tech bad, and it also doesn't mean we shouldn't still have unfettered access to that tech -- the bad people may just be a hit we take because the benefit of the tech is so enormous.\n\nSoftware like Tor for example enables people to run hidden services and to browse the web anonymously, and of course a lot of bad people use that for doing bad things.  But it also enables people in repressive countries to secretly communicate and contact journalists and have a safe area they can communicate.  I think that's an acceptable tradeoff and that the good outweighs the bad.","&gt; First, I'm curious where in my post I make any points that require the internet be different from the real word.\n\nI inferred it. Hey it's late here. You make some good points. But at the end of the day I'm just disagreeing with you about the fundamental issue that I don't see an opt out filter on your internet that is part of the sign up process as a big deal. I also have no issues if the government want to proactively try and remove illegal content from the net such as illegal porn or the ability to buy services or goods that are illegal in the real world. The internet shouldn't be above the law imo and if something requires id or a license or is illegal in the real world then the same rules should apply to those partcular items or activities on the net as well.\n\n Anyway we're in danger of going off on a massive tangent here that I don't want to get involved in. As a whole I'm against censorship in the media and online. Your points about repressive countries censoring content and communication is spot on.  I just don't think comparing the internet in somewhere like north korea is at all comparable to an opt out porn filter that is set as part of the sign up process with your ISP. I just think we just have different opinions on where the line is and I don't consider an opt out filter that big a deal in principal. \n\nIf it helps explain my position a bit better if the filter was mandatory AND you couldn't opt out then I'd have issues. Even more so if non illegal \\ age restricted items were filtered or items of political sensitivity that doesn't fit the current narrative. I think it's important for me to reiterate that I'm arguing in favor for an opt out porn filter that you can opt out at sign up with your ISP. I'm not arguing in favor of becoming some sort of North Korean \\ Chinese black out on anything the government doesn't want you to know about which I'm guessing where a lot of the fear in this topic is coming from.","I certainly understand your views, and I also know I'm a bit die-hard all or nothing about it.  I have a great fear of the first steps of censorship slipping down that slippery slope at a very fast rate, and on top of that I lean more heavily on the \"all speech even hate speech and other horribleness should be allowed\" side of things, so even \"reasonable\" things often aren't acceptable to me.  And of course, content blocking, even if you can opt-out, I obviously don't care for.  (Since you can always opt-out by simply not visiting the site to begin with.  Have you ever typed a URL you wanted to visit and then been blocked and *not* been annoyed?  If you wanted to not see the site, you wouldn't have tried to visit it!)  I strongly feel the default needs to be free and open and then you must opt-in for censorship.\n\nBut your views are completely understandable and perfectly fair.","I'm not sure why I'm getting down voted for this.

My friend is my fraternity brother from college and at the time of the story was a fairly high ranking civilian contractor for the military that works on an American base.  About 2 years before the day of the story, he was cleaning up his kids playroom and had extra model clay and thought it would be a random idea to make a fake looking bomb with red curly wires, a clock, etc.  This was of course before 9/11 because as much as an idiot as my friend is, he would never think of doing this in present times.  Anyway, he had brought it to work to show his friends (he is a scientist and thought his friends would get a kick out of it).   He threw it in his desk and ultimately forgot about it.  \n\nOK so fast forward a few years later and my friend gets promoted to an even higher post.  He is cleaning out his desk and boxing things up and heads out to lunch off base.\n\nYou know where this is going.  He gets back to base and at the vehicle checkpoint to enter base there is a swarm of military police.  Upon showing his ID the MPs swarm his car (he is with 3 or 4 other people) and they tell him, with hands on guns but still holstered, \"sir you need to come with us\".\n\nMy friend tells me he shits a brick because he has no idea wtf is going on, and the MPs drive him in a jeep across base and as they approach his lab he sees fire engines, hazmat team, police, and the entire building and surrounding buildings evacuated.  All of a sudden it hits him.  He remembered unpacking the desk into boxes and left his \"toy\" visible in an open box.\n\nHe starts explaining himself and at first nobody believes him.  But ultimately the situation deescalates and returns to normal.\n\nThe next day, my friend is called to the office of the Base Commander and I am told the Base Commander looked him in the eyes with doors closed, allowed my friend to tell his story,  and the response was a calm \"what the fuck is wrong with you?\"  He was told about the cost of the shut down, the back story of what had transpired, and told to never allow something like that to happen again.  The Base Commander left it at that, figuring my friend was an idiot but otherwise spared him.\n\nThe best part of this story is that my friend is brilliant.  He holds a PhD, was very high ranking at the base, and now some 20 years later has been promoted very very high up in the hierarchy.  But I knew him in college when we were stupid and before he was a high ranking important dude.   So the story remains very special to me as a favorite.\n\nI remind him of this story at least once every 2 years.","That's part of the problem.  Being smart, intelligence- that has no bearing on whether or not the consequences are figured out.  \"Who in their right mind would build a real bomb?\"- but fakes they're OK.  Everyone will know it's a fake because real bombs don't look like they do on TV... etc.  \n\nI've no doubt your friend is definitely up there in the intelligence compartment- the 'common sense' or 'societal expectations' isn't a requirement for intelligence.  Fortunately the MPs weren't trigger happy...","18 Intelligence 6 Wisdom","The issue is in American culture if you're in charge you can't just say \"I'm an expert on these things and I *made the executive decision* that the toy did not pose a threat.\" ","Or maybe smart people overestimate dumb people who in reality can't figure simple shit out.

They started knocking on other doors to see if anyone knew where I was located and my friend Al says yeah I know him. They explained about the beer and tried to give it to Al, who's only 20 and a naturally suspicious person. So he declined. They insisted. He declined again and they said they'd leave the beer there for me to pick up. \n\nSome time later I get a call from Al explaining a bunch of SPs are still trying to give him, an underage airman living in a dorm where you can't drink by order of the base commander, a case of beer.

They were Creationists, and they lived in the foothills. During our stay, a huge fire broke out 20 miles away and raged through the hills, wiping out neighborhoods in its path.\n\nAt one point, around 4:00 AM, the fire was getting so close so quickly that the police stormed through the neighborhood and made everyone evacuate. They pounded on doors and screamed through bullhorns: *\"Leave now! Do not pack luggage! Do not gather your pets!\"* They wanted everyone to leave RIGHT NOW.\n\nA minute later, I saw why...\n\nI ran out the door with my baby daughter in my arms, and the fire on the ridge line was *right there*, just behind the houses across the street. In the wall of flames were these tiny little dots on the ridge line. I had to look again to realize they were *firefighters* forming a line, in the thick of it, fighting that fire. The flames dwarfed them. They fought it for days. Some didn't make it out alive.\n\nDays later, we finally got news that our friends' neighborhood was spared. Our friends immediately bowed in prayer and thanked God. I thought to myself, how about thanking the firefighters? But I figured, hey, they're overjoyed and this is how they're expressing their monumental relief. Surely, they know who saved their home.\n\nWrong. Over the next two weeks, they told many friends and family about the ordeal on many occasions, and not ONCE did they thank the firefighters. It was always God. God wanted their house spared. God placed his hand down the center of their street and held back the fire. God refused to let the fire harm His worshippers (or rather, their house, since they were safely evacuated, thanks to the police).\n\nI finally opened my mouth and said \"Don't forget the firefighters.\" They looked at me with daggers. Instead of saying, yeah, true, let's give them due credit, their stance was \"Well who do you think guided them?\"\n\nARRGHHHH!!!","This damn wind got in my eyes...","Maybe it's glaucoma.

If you're religious god is everywhere and in everything, even doctors.","So if god made the doctors, didn't god also make her child blind in the first place?","That's not how they usually think of it but some people view bad things in life as God testing their resolve/god won't give me more than I can take etc. It's comforting for a lot of people to feel like there is something bigger than them out there.

I think they see it more like a guiding force that allows them to be as good as they are, not \"Oh, I'm just derping along in life and God is doing all the precise medicine for me.\"","Exactly. They see God as the being that gave them their intelligence and drive, gave them their access to school, etc. They aren't saying they didn't have to work for it. \"God helps them who help themselves\" sums up the attitude usually.

It holds no bearing in any real religious context other than to say that you're fucked or not fucked because of your own actions.","I didn't say it was a biblical quote, I said it was an attitude. The idea is that God won't just drop good fortune on you from the sky, but that he smiles upon those who go out and work for it.","This seems like a reasonable explanation for the phrase \"God did it\", but it's not necessarily how all people will understand it. That's the problem with it.","She wasn't speaking for all people. She's not a world leader or a diplomat, she's a low income woman from Brazil. She's just speaking to her beliefs and her view of the world.","Because God isn't as kind as people like to think he is, because if you read it, he wants to test us, not fan us and drop grapes in our mouths, and leaves nature to batter us.

What does that prove?","Good question...I could hazard a number of guesses, but I think \"selective thinking\" is strongly implicated in many ways.","I dont think that Christians believe that God does evil, but he lets things happen.  TBH, this is something I'm working on understanding.

Doctors in Brazil couldn't do the surgery, and somehow all these people banded together and got her and her child (who was previously blind, deaf, and unable to walk) and cured her!

She's probably not educated enough to know why the surgeries worked, so she sees the incredible results as God working through the doctors, people who donated, people that coordinated the travel, etc. People in this thread are looking at the world in an entirely different way than a devoutly religious and dubiously educated woman from Brazil is.

Or they chose to live that kind of life. \n\nAgain placebos or self fulfilling prophecy. \n\n","The all good/all powerful thing breaks down like this.\n\nAssume god is all-powerful. There is bad in this world; indeed, the universe tends towards death and destruction (google entropy). People die horrible deaths. Families are broken apart.\n\nA good example of this kind of thing is the disease Fatal Familial Insommnia. It runs in families genetically. When the child of one of these families turns ~15-18, the disease sets in.\n\nThen, they never, ever sleep again; their brain prevents them. No matter how pious, how extraordinary their belief, they gradually fall into a coma, and then die. There is no treatment.\n\nSo now, we have to question the motivations of an all-powerful god. He can, as an all powerful being, stop everything bad in the world. Sure, perhaps humans need some free will here and there, perhaps we set our own ways, but to have a genetic mark on child from birth that makes them die a horrible death? That is not a 'good' thing, and thus an all powerful god is not all good. However, God, supposedly, is a loving god.\n\nTherefore, he cannot be all powerful. \n\nRe; not praying to the correct god; In my book, a god that refuses to help those who believe in other gods, no matter their predicament or morality, is a pretty petty sort of god.","I have no idea of God.

You sound like someone who gets his political news from NowThis and NowThis Election.","The ideology that Trump follows and promotes is particularly dangerous and violent. There is nothing wrong with trying to stop that violence from happening by protesting inside the event. Peacefully protesting outside the event will get nothing done whatsoever. The kind of logic you follow to end violence is what allows violent ideologies to take hold. No one can stop Trump or fascism through peaceful protests. And I don't know what NowThis is but okay.","&gt;Peacefully protesting outside the event will get nothing done whatsoever\n\nNeither does protesting in the event. You have no right to protest on his property (private events, therefore his) and you're interrupting him and wasting his and everyone-else-there-to-listen-to-him's time. Haven't you figured out with all this violence and protesting you're just showing why people support him. And please, just go over this \"violent ideology\" with me because I'm pretty sure I haven't really heard anything from him about racial purity or hurting people.","&gt;You have no right to protest on his property\n\nSays who?\n\n&gt;you're interrupting him and wasting his and everyone-else-there-to-listen-to-him's time\n\nI know, that's a real crime. Just think of the horrors of that inconvenience!\n\n&gt;Haven't you figured out with all this violence and protesting you're just showing why people support him\n\nSo Trump supporters like Trump because some people don't want Trump and his ideology to have any power at all? I think they like him because they enjoy hearing xenophobic statements and hate anyone that is different than them. \n\n&gt;just go over this \"violent ideology\" with me because I'm pretty sure I haven't really heard anything from him about racial purity or hurting people\n\nDonald wants to ban nearly 1.6 billion people from entering the United States because he deems them all possibly terrorists. This is despite the fact that in the United States since 2001, twice as many terrorist attacks were by right-wing Americans than by Muslims according to [NAF](http://securitydata.newamerica.net/extremists/deadly-attacks.html). You'd think Donald would want to ban the most dangerous groups to keep America safe but no, he's simply Islamophobic.\n\nTrump finds Mexicans to be dangerous people also. I'm sure you already read his famous quote: [\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/16/full-text-donald-trump-announces-a-presidential-bid/) Mexicans are first and foremost rapists or criminals or smugglers to him. Sure, he thinks some may be good, but to say that Mexico is actively sending bad people into the United States is ludicrous. That's where his xenophobia comes into play. \n\nAnother thought, if Trump wanted to secure the borders wouldn't he also want a wall on the Canadian border? That may be a little racism although it could be argued.\n\nI think we can all agree that Trump is sexist, I don't even have to get into that.\n\nAll of these ideas are violent and promote the hatred and inequality of people of different religions, ethnicities, and sexes. As long as a person who strives for a magnitude of power promotes these ideas, they are a threat to the people whom will be affected negatively by the ideas and need to be resisted. I also am of the belief that capitalism is an oppressive and terrible economic system, which Donald is clearly a fan of considering his massive amount of wealth. ","&gt;Says who?\n\nSays him you dumb shit. His campaign manager tells EVERYONE to protest outside in the area reserved for peaceful protesting. His rallies are private property, therefore you are trespassing and infringing his rules and are allowed to be booted out.\n\n&gt;I know, that's a real crime. Just think of the horrors of that inconvenience!\n\nClassic. And you wonder why the protestors are booted out and told to fuck off.\n\n&gt;So Trump supporters like Trump because some people don't want Trump and his ideology to have any power at all? I think they like him because they enjoy hearing xenophobic statements and hate anyone that is different than them.\n\nYou're such a cuck it's unbelievable. \"hate anyone that is different than them,\" you have completely summarized left wing identity politics. Trump is popular because he doesn't bullshit things and people are becoming sick of the current political establishment.\n\n&gt;Trump finds Mexicans to be dangerous people also\n\nAbsolutely knew this would come up. First off, notice the line \"And some, I assume, are good people,\" meaning there are some who are probably good decent human beings (don't think I need to explain this). And did you know [80% of girls who cross the border illegally are raped by the men they travel with?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/central-america-migrants-rape_n_5806972.html). [How about some of the murder rates](http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/08/08/illegal-alien-crime-accounts-for-over-30-of-murders-in-some-states/) (I get it's Breibart, but the statistics aren't biased). Can't bullshit the facts. And I don't think I need to explain the massive drug trade across the Mexican border. There's no xenophobia here, just no ignorance towards the facts\n\n&gt;Donald wants to ban nearly 1.6 billion people from entering the United States because he deems them all possibly terrorists. This is despite the fact that in the United States since 2001, twice as many terrorist attacks were by right-wing Americans than by Muslims according to NAF. You'd think Donald would want to ban the most dangerous groups to keep America safe but no, he's simply Islamophobic.\n\nAnother thing I knew would come up. [America's population of muslims is integrated and very moderate compared to the world](http://www.meforum.org/4218/the-moderation-of-american-muslims). Of course there haven't been a lot of attacks. But have you seen Europe lately? Muslims are 23 times more likely to rape in Sweden, and [a crime involving a muslim immigrant happens practically everyday in some European country](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/01/29/migrant-crisis-live-wire/). Also, he never said banning Islam completely, he said banning Muslim entry, which is understandable considering how Europe, Africa, and the Middle East have gone haywire with Islamic radicalism and crime rates.\n\n&gt;I think we can all agree that Trump is sexist, I don't even have to get into that.\n\nActually, please go into that if you may. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/09/donald-trump-i-cherish-women/\n\n&gt;I also am of the belief that capitalism is an oppressive and terrible economic system.\n\nYeah, no it's not. Capitalism gives everyone the chance if they work hard enough. The whole point of a capitalist free market is that it forces businesses to compete against each other, and the harder, more efficient worker wins.\n\n\n\nhttp://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/conrad-black-in-defence-of-donald-trump\n\nhttp://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/conrad-black-dont-underestimate-donald-he-will-win\n\nI suggest you read these to their full lengths.","&gt;You're such a cuck it's unbelievable\n\nSpotted the reactionary alt-right! You really come off as such an asshole when your go to insult in an argument is cuck.\n\n&gt;Trump is popular because he doesn't bullshit things and people are becoming sick of the current political establishment\n\n\"he doesn't bullshit things\" reminds me of phrases like \"He speaks the truth\" when talking about Trump because they mean nothing. Trump oversimplifies issues to black and white. He is just like every single neoconservative except he cannot be controlled by the country he runs. He holds the same beliefs as the rest of the establishment. \n\n&gt;just no ignorance towards the facts\n\nBut there is an ignorance towards how to use those facts. When things like crossing the border or smuggling drugs are illegal, the only people who are willing to cross the border or smuggle drugs are poor people. They need money and or a better life and are willing to do those things because they have no other choice. With crime and poverty comes a lack of education which is the reason why the rape rate is so high and why the murder rate is so high. People who rape and murder are products of an improper education, improper mental healthcare, and poverty.\n\n&gt;Muslims are 23 times more likely to rape in Sweden, and a crime involving a muslim immigrant happens practically everyday in some European country\n\nLike in the response to your statistics about illegal immigrants, the Muslim people who enter Sweden are products of their environment and if you can't tell, the Middle East isn't a great place to live, just like Mexico.\n\n&gt;Also, he never said banning Islam completely, he said banning Muslim entry, which is understandable considering how Europe, Africa, and the Middle East have gone haywire with Islamic radicalism and crime rates\n\nI don't think banning anyone from entering a country is understandable. Simply because a small minority of a religion are extremists does not mean everyone is. And how would he even implement that policy? Would he just ask every brown person at the border if they practice Islam?\n\n&gt;Actually, please go into that if you may\n\n[This](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/18-real-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women_us_55d356a8e4b07addcb442023) article directly references that quote so you may find it helpful. By the way, a person can say they aren't sexist but can still say sexist things. You do realize that?\n\n&gt;Capitalism gives everyone the chance if they work hard enough\n\nNot if they grow up in a poor background. How is someone growing up in low income housing, working a difficult minimum wage job supposed to compete? The world shouldn't be difficult for the less fortunate. There shouldn't be a less fortunate, the world can move past classes.\n\n&gt;The whole point of a capitalist free market is that it forces businesses to compete against each other\n\nThis is code for paying workers the least you can, selling products for as high as you can, getting rid of pollutants as cheaply as possible which destroys the environment tremendously, and profits going directly to those who did not labor to earn those profits. \n\nWe can move beyond capitalism. The profit incentive that causes starvation and low wages doesn't have to exist. Socialism is more than capable of ensuring no one starves in a world where there is enough food and shelter for everyone. I enjoy having complete worker autonomy and that is impossible under capitalism. You will always have a master under capitalism.\n\n","Ugh you are an insufferable fuck. Im definitely to the left but you are just so dense its ridiculous. I'll let someone more eloquent and less rude then myself to explain to you how stupid you sound.","But then is the violence even stopped? ","Violence is used to stop violence and for no other reason.

If you're bringing government into violence, call Socialism or Communism violent since most genocides have been under those forms of government","&gt;How the fuck is capitalism violent?\n\nCapitalism requires a state to enforce violent property laws in which the working class is exploited and doesn't receive the full fruits of their labor. Profits off of their labor, an extension of their self, are taken by capitalists who benefit and use those property laws to live off of other's labor.\n\n&gt;If you're bringing government into violence\n\nCapitalism and socialism are general economic ideas.\n\n&gt;call Socialism or Communism violent since most genocides have been under those forms of government\n\nCitation needed. The countries you're thinking of as socialist or communist are, I assume, the Soviet Union and China. They are considered state capitalist by many because the undemocratic states of those countries took over the means of production leaving the workers with no power over their work, the opposite of socialism which is capitalism. Socialism is worker control of the means of production. Communism is a form of socialism which is stateless, moneyless, classless, and propertyless. The countries were definitely not communist although a case could be made for them being socialist at times. Even if you consider those countries socialist (which they really weren't), the atrocities which happened in those countries were not caused by what economic system in place. They were caused by power hungry dictators like Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. The Soviet Union and China are, if anything, a sign that power cannot be monopolized by small groups of people like the wealthy under capitalism and the state under failed attempts at communism.

Half the front page posts on /r/the_donald aren't even about the campaign, it's just news articles about refugees in Europe and people bitching.  \n\nOne time, for funsies, I checked out some profiles posting on the_donald, and a lot of them also post on r/european, which is probably the most racist subreddit on this site.  They say nigger not like \"we're saying nigger lol\" and more like \"get these monkey ass niggers the fuck out of my country.\"  Also lots of good shit about wanting to kill Muslims, etc.  I don't understand their end game, anyways.  What do they want, a good ol' fashioned race war?\n\nAt least the internet presence of Trump supporters has become less about actual politics and more about participating in an echo chamber of racism.  Like, dudes, I don't want unchecked immigration like those dumbass Germans but Islam is not on my radar of importance for issues in U.S politics.  Shut the fuck up.\n\nThis post made me giggle, tho.","Hey man, not here to start an argument but as a poster and browser of r/european I can answer a few of those questions for you. Yes we do have some extreme racists on there and I don't blame you for being shocked about it. It's quite cancerous but I am a true believer in free speech and I allow anyone to express their opinions freely no matter what they are. The general purpose of the subreddit in my honest opinion is to post relatively unbiased and uncensored news regarding europe which would normally be taken down due to some progressive left censorship. As an aussie, I am still concerned with certain situations in europe as I still have some family living there. I hope I cleared just a few things up for you atleast, thanks mate.","As an actual European, let me tell you the posts on /r/european are mostly very biased.","Whatever you say, man.  Every time I walk into one of the comment sections there's always someone going on about how Arabs and Africans are racially inferior, did all the of the bad things in history, and have no right to be in Europe, and anyone who questions that ideology is denying history and science.  But if you want to use that place as a news source, more power to you I guess.","Reddit is generally a place of draconian rules that impede on free speech and extreme propaganda and censorship. I go there to vent and receive a metaphorical breath of fresh air. I know it may not be your cup of tea, but if you avoid the stupid comments which are quite prevalent throughout  (though which fucking subreddit doesn't have their fair share of retards?) It is a great place to gather and share information which would be otherwise censored on any other news website.

No racism there.\n\n/r/european is the subreddit known for \"the negros are inferior\" posts.\n\nThere's a lot of overlap between the two subs, but there's no overlap between religious intolerance and racism.","Hating Islam as a set of doctrines isn't xenophobic though. Hating muslims as a matter of principle because they're muslims is wrong but there are some fucked up doctrines in Islam.","&gt; I agree with you hating muslims as a matter of principle because they're muslims is wrong but there are some fucked up doctrines in Islam.\n\nI respectfully disagree. I see where you are getting at, \"Hate the ideology, not the follower\".\n\nBut to me, the followers keep the ideology alive. It's like saying \"Don't hate the nazi, hate hitler\". But Hitler's support is what made him Hitler. So I *do* hate Muslims solely because they're Muslims, they keep the Islamic doctrines alive. Remember, associating yourself with a religion is a **choice**. It's like **choosing** to be a white supremacist and then claiming \"Naziphobia!\", or \"Hate the game, not the player!\", when called out on your racism. Islamophobia is justified in my eyes because of this, it's inherently different from racism.\n\nNow before you call me out on anything, I just want to say that;\n\na) I know that some people don't choose their religion. Babies born in the Islamic state will most likely be converted to extremists because that's how they were raised, and due to a lack of education, they don't know any better. I don't hate those guys, I hate ones that live in a westernized modern city, but want to apply Sharia law to it. I hate the ones that escaped their hellhole, and now want to turn our society into their hellhole.\n\nb) I know that there are 'progressive' Muslims who don't strictly follow their religion. Those who condemn the Quran's intolerance, and those who even fight for womens' rights and LGBT rights. But these guys are hardly Muslims, they're Muslims by association. These guys are about as Muslim as Liberals born Christians are actual Christians, in other words, not at all.\n\nBut thanks for sharing, you bring up a good point, I just wanted a chance to refute.","That's not to say I am not against all muslims. I am. They believe in a set of doctrines which is at odds with modern western progressive society. Now obviously Maajid Nawaz isn't as high on the agenda as ISIS as to who I'm against and hate.

I don't like radical Islam either, and I don't want tons of Muslim immigrants in the U.S.  This is mostly Europe's problem right now, and it's not even close to a big issue in the U.S.  Blaming Muslims and Mexicans for America's laundry list of problems just shows the lack of education of Trump's supporters.\n\nIt's hilarious how not wanting Muslim hate to dominate the conversation automatically means I fucking love the religion.  Try again.","&gt;when they spew so much hate about Muslims\n\n\nYou do realize that the above statement in the context of your post is deriding Trump supporters for the act of spewing hate at Muslims. You are taking issue with the problem we (Trump supporters) have with Muslims and the derision we profess at them.\n\n\nSo, you're issue could be one of two potential scenarios;\n\n\n1) You take issue with anyone or any group that derides another weather legitimate or not. This means you just want everyone to be \"nice\" to each other.\n\n\n2) You take issue with the actual derision aimed at Muslims. This is indicative of an individual that supports or at least accepts the positions of Islam and it's Muslim followers. \n\n\nYet you then make the statement:\n\n&gt;I don't like radical Islam either\n\n\nThere is no such thing as \"radical Islam\". There is only Islam and its teachings and the adherents to its teaching.

You either misunderstand the meaning of xenophobia or are purposefully misconstruing the meaning to suit your contentions. The definition of Xenophobia is: *\"having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries.\"*\n\nI challenge you to find posts on r/The_Donald where supporters indicate hatred for *middle easterners*. You see, Islam and Muslims are not a race and do not come from one specific country. Trump supporters take issue with MUSLIMS and ISLAM which is NOT a race, but a RELIGION and as such no such xenophobia is being propagated. \n\n\n","I really enjoyed this comment because it's just interesting to see your mental gymnastics and how you people actually justify your warped view of reality.

My dad is retired and is quite handy with these moderately difficult upgrades.  There were a few of the houses that had very out-dated bathrooms and kitchens.  They saw roughly 1.3x returns by renovating them.  It's not a guaranteed return, but it can definitely add value under the right circumstances.","People will pay more just to not have to deal with bathroom or kitchen renovations.

","That depends, a lot. If you pay someone to do the work, there may be little or no ROI. But if you do the work yourself you can have a huge return.

I did almost all the rest myself, but paid a few grand for the tile guy's labor and 1400 or so more to the plumber, [edit: and spray foam insulation, and shower walls] and I'm sure many thousand on the tile, fixtures, etc. but still a small fraction of 42k. I'm still finishing up the trim, which takes me forever, but it's already a nicer bathroom than we've seen in million dollar condos around here.","It depends on if what you've got is total shit now.  If you are looking at 80's laminate wood cabinets and shitty color tone sinks, you will significantly raise your house value by renovating to something new and neutral.  If you already have something reasonably neutral, even if its a little old, you are better off keeping it.  Doing it yourself is a huge difference, too. If you are reasonably handy or have a friend who can help with stuff like simple plumbing you will save a TON which is cash back in your pocket.  If you are paying a contractor to do all renovations, the payback will naturally take a lot longer.  \n  \nSource: Tried to sell my house a few years ago with original fixtures. 0 (none, zip, not even a nibble) offers after several months.

In a hot or high priced market, buyers are not going to care about most of the renovation you do.  Chances are they will rip them all out for their own style or will just value any renovations at a minimum. In really low markets, it may also be hard to get back any costs. YMMV ","The ROI on renovations is frequently negative, but the same can't be said for routine maintenance and repairs.

Having a shitty cluttered mess didn't make it more tactical.

CSGO is being played during times where everyone has an outlet to quickly vent their frustrations. During the 1.6 era, where would you go to complain of you didn't like something?

Combine this with a **tighter** area, this makes pushing up banana something completely different and, imo, less rewarding and interesting to watch/play.","After reading some of the comments, I think that the best solution would be to have banana as wide as it is on the pictures of the map, but have the fountain in the middle of it.","Banana looks like it would play so poorly. the car plays just fine on banana it just needs to be a bit wider without being open nothinness like in this picture. also the way you have that arch angled would make gun fights super awkward.","I'm going to drop my 2 cents as a shitty player. \n\n1. I agree with widening banana, but we can't go straight to \"OPEN EVERYTHING UP, NO COVER.

I understand that people had problems with it, but I don't think removing it is correct. However, I understand that we can't make it polygon heaven. I don't want that either, I've got a comp that struggles enough anyways. We don't need Fish AI, we don't need perfection on details. We need consistent hitboxes.\n\n3. Please don't forget that not *everything* is about competitive. It has to be **ENJOYABLE** to play. That's why I dislike the \"WHY NOT DO WHAT WE DID IN 1.6\" that people are saying to everything. Because we want a map that's appealing to players, enjoyable. We don't want a map that's only played in competitive because it's no fun to play. \n\nTL;DR: Widen banana but keep it closer to current banana. Keep the fountain, fix it.

Hardly 2 entrances","CT is a lot harder to get to and the CT's will have a lot of time to prepare for that hit, but by that merit D2 A has 3 entrances. \n\nOk lets look at it this way, mid on inferno is that wide, and if you flash out there you can catch opponents off, but its much more risky because you have powerful angles like underpass, mexican, bench, and second mid to worry about. On this iteration of banana the only angle is the wood pile, which is 1 angle which I don't think is as powerful as the other examples which makes those positions contestable.\n\nE: The problem is you're not making a valid point","Dumb question: What's/where's Mexican?","That hole in mid where T side tends to hide.

However, if it's too wide terrorists can get easy banana control that can make the map t sided. The difference between long a and banana is that you can take shots at the site. If you take banana control, you can't just spray at the other side of the wall. It's why often ct's need 2 at long. Long control is essential in dust2. Banana isn't to inferno. It's mandatory to lock down a site without long control (usually) but it's not hard for ct's to secure b site in inferno without banana control.","Imo their should be 2 pillars on bannana, one closes to T's, one closest to cts. Also add the roof back for flashes.\n\nB site I like alot, the addition of that crate seems like it would introduce a new element to the site, both for retaking and and executes, and i'm sure it'd be my new fav spot.\n\nWhy is the arch so wide? It being able to be smoked off means that there's 2 ways for T's to enter the site and not just 1.\n\nWhat's with the bridge? I see no reason for it.\n\nWhy have you cut off that door way in ct? Rotates are long enough already. \n\nI Like the rest of the A site changes, but why remove the stone pillars at truck side?

In 'old' Inferno, 2 T's could clear apts by having one in alt molly dark room and another watch from the stairs for exiting CT's. The stairs player watches the head angle of boiler while the alt player jumps into balcony; he clears the rest of boiler and then they double peek long hall.

The only way to counter that would be to boost an AWP in the corridor, which can be risky given the extra ground T's will now get. The door in apps doesn't work, it may seem like it gives more to the T's but it actually hinders them massively, gaining access to apps isn't the issue it's the exit that creates the problems. The door stops things such as grenades into boiler to support a player jumping into window room. It also ruins any surprise moves from window room to someone playing L, often times you can catch them looking at stairs and with a quick shot it's pretty much a free frag. If you wanted to do something like this then you should really just copy 1.6 and have a little hatch that goes into window room and remove that section pretty much altogether, but personally I feel the current version of apps is fine, if a little bit hard to exit onto the site from.  Perhaps a doorway opposite arch site underneath the little roof thing would help it and give a little bit more freedom to players trying to make a play onto the site. Personally I feel most of these changes are unnecessary. Fountain for example, why remove it? the real issue with fountain is visibility which is created most because of the small reeds that pop out and the colour of the fountain against the CT players, so why not simply make the fountain a more clean one? thus making the black CT bodies pop out and without strange foliage to block vision. \n\nWhich brings me onto my next point as to what Inferno needs. The visibility of CT's vs T's is so unfair it's no surprise CT's demolish on the map. Take dark room for example, it is not even funny how much easier you can spot T's hiding in the room over CT's, and that's an issue throughout the map. \n\nSo to finish of my stupidly long rant about what should and shouldn't be done, remove the arches from banana and give some extra benefits for the T side of it to give the T side extra pressure from that point throughout the round, widen arches so that smokes have to be as precise as D2 A mid smoke, thus making the constant smoke barrage a least harder, keep apps mostly the same but add some more aid to exiting them, clean the map up, make the map brighter and make it so that in places such as dark room both CT and T can be seen as clearly as each other.

Ok, might be easier for the CT to fight the T behind the car, but a few rounds later you will be in the other team anyway.","Not \"easy\" necessarily, just consistent. Fighting someone at forklift or truck on inferno pit is just awkward because a lot of the time your bullets will hit the metal parts which usually have really terrible penetration making it annoying for both sides. \n\nWhereas with a box or regular angled object, you're getting the same fight but without the bullshit of an enemy being saved by a 1mm metal bar.","I second that.\n","the way HE grenades work in  CS:GO create a need for less obstacles.

That is why we are still playing 1.6. /s\n\n\nAesthetics (sound,animation,placing,collisions etc) are incredibly important in generating the feel of the game. No game taught me more about that than Arma3 after playing Arma2 for years. The small things bring so much life into the game that it is incredible that the basics of both games are the same. Furthermore, in generating viewership and popularising a game, such things are important. Not everything is up to the pros that surely lack the vision (due to personal interests). Trading all these assets for boxes is also lazy and I think the issue these assets have are overblown due to people trying to label everything as RNG.\n\nI agree that banana should be somewhat wider, but I like the the cache forklift and the banana car. Not everything should be straight up and simple. It used to be like that because we lacked the proper time and technology. Some people are just too used to that framework.","The maps were way better in 1.6 from a competitive point of view and I would still play 1.6 if there wasn't a severe lack of opposing players(who could shoot back) to play against.\n\n\nI don't really mind cool aesthetics in CS:GO maps, as long as it doesn't make the game worse.

It is a bit more intricate than that. The whole system is a system similar to gambling, I make this distinction due to the before mentioned reasoning and because the legal inaction by law enforcement and the judical system puts it into a grey area as a whole. \nI think the monetary gains Valve gets are more from the skin boxes RNG than the full-on betting of skins.","&gt;And you know why tournament organised went CSGO?

Then the devs balanced the game out a bit, removed a few crazy stats here and there, got the OP weapons in check and the underpowered weapons got a buff. The pros starting looking a bit towards this game, it was a fresh new experience that was provided thanks to things like no bhopping and a new meta surrounding weapons.\n\nThen the devs introduced matchmaking, the community started growing again.

You are, and it further displays your inability to be reasoned with.\n\n CSGO isn't a popular game because the pros are here. The pros are here because it is a popular eSport.

No, you wouldn't be still playing and watching 1.6 even if by some deus ex machina the tournaments organisers decided not to come and then the players didn't decide to come. Both circles would crumble into themselves and new organisations would arise to take their place in CSGO eSports that would replace them.

I see no real reason for some of the design changes but \"well, it was like this in 1.6, guess it is better then!\". This is not a good mindset to have, 1.6 was not perfect nor it was superior in every aspect to csgo. I do agree with some things like widening some areas, changing the truck and adding visibility, but some changes like returning the bridge on moto I find highly unnecessary. ","It honestly depends, the only thing bad about the pond was the moss on it which could maybe abstract a bit of vision but other than that it's fine, it's a simple enough object it should be fine but things like forklift/cars/trucks its usually better to use a box, look at forklift in cache it's all around just an annoying spot for both cts and ts and I personally think cache would be better without it, but truck on cache is fine because of how simple it is, you won't be climbing over it, unlike on car in banana. The truck next to pit is probably the most frustrating thing to climb on if you don't have it down yet and even them it would be easier to just have a box instead of having to jump onto a certain part to get up onto truck. Boxes are over all better for competitive consistency but cars/trucks should be used if they can be properly implemented.","The pillars on the opposite side of Banana actually would probably work out pretty well.

Nuts you new people think every map should be 8-7. I guess bomb sites should be in the middle of the maps next right?","I'm not saying every map should be 8-7, 9-6 and even 10-5 halves are fine but when the best teams in the world with the best strategies struggle to get more than 3 rounds on their T half shows that there are some issues. \n\nAnd to back up my point about how the pro's don't like it, look how often old nuke was played in the past, it was an auto ban for most top teams with exception of NIP and Dignitas. Almost everyone prefers more balanced maps with the odd side balance which is why current inferno is great in terms of balance, it's a CT sided map but a good team can still sometimes come out on top on their T half, which nearly never happened on old nuke and older versions on overpass","Of course you'd rather get a map that's even, so that even if you have an off day on T or CT, you may not get totally punished for it. We'll see how newke will play out.. but this new inferno looks perfect so far.","Every map should be a bit CT-sided.

You can't win a 1v4 (your grenade might do damage to 2 people, and they'll probably push the smoke, expect the flash, etc.). With four people rushing your little corner with no cover with P90s, AKs, Tec-9s, nades, you're basically dead. If you want to get out of cover and fall back, you're fucked too,  you'll be exposed for a long ass time before you can go to sandbags area. Then when you want to fall back, you'll be exposed to banana again. In the current banana, you have a ton of cover, even if it has bad geometry. Plus, you can just stack up enemies. About 2 enemies can go to car at a time, which is easy for 2 people to kill.","But the T's would need some flashes to get into the position (AWP/crossfire) and the CT's could fall back and get to another position.

One smoke can stop the T's almost everywhere in the banana(at least 3 spots). That is the main reason T's hate banana and why top teams can't change the meta.

Idk, I just rarely see CTs with mollies retaking on A.","Yeah, you are right about the pace of the map. It's obviously more situational then I made it seem, just generally if both B players have mollies, and they don't get pushed, there's few instances that they'd both use their mollies before a retake. One instance being if they pre-Molly a possible rush. Another being if they want to retake car control mid round. I suppose if the other team makes a good point of baiting out utility, then both mollies could go out, but generally once the first smoke is gone you play info angles to delay the rest of the smokes, which frees up the Molly for stopping a push.

As someone who could do the jump beforehand, I like what they have now much better. Let me explain why. Nuke was way too CT sided for the map pool it was in. This map pool doesn't operate like the 1.6 one did, now it operates around a bunch of even maps that specific teams play better than other specific teams. Therefore, maps should be balanced. \n\n\nYou shouldn't have to be able to do a specific jump to make a map balanced. The silo is a huge benefit to Ts controlling the outside, and taking that away seriously hurts the map, all for some people's egos. I get it, it sucks that something we practiced and worked hard at got snatched. But it really affects the map.\n\n\nThe rest of it is great, but the A site looks dope as it is.","Thorin did an amazing job in one of his videos explaining not just why not all maps need to be even, but why not all maps should be even. There should be even maps, but there should be T and CT sided maps too. That diversity is healthy. \n\nAlso, what do you mean by \"the map pool is different.\" For your statement there to be justified you cannot mean simply that the maps in it are different. (And I don't see any other point to be made there.)\n","The maps *are* different, and significantly so. 1.6 had dust2, which was pretty T-Sided for the time, Tuscan, which has always been T-sided, Inferno, which was as balanced as you got in 1.6, Nuke, which retained its 63% CT win rate, and Train, which was almost as CT-sided as Nuke.\n\n\nTrain has been re-made. Nuke has been re-made. Inferno is gone, Tuscan is gone, and we've had Cobblestone, Overpass, Cache, and Mirage, all of which are reasonably balanced maps. The dynamic is completely gone. What Thorin said in that video (which is really a great video) is that the whole idea revolved around a very select map pool. This is gone. Therefore, throwing one oddball in there for no reason is just going to fuck with the new dynamic. I'm all for returning to the old map pool, but fucking with this one just won't work.\n\n\nThe old dynamic was this: five maps. Two CT-sided maps, (Nuke/Train) Two T-sided maps, (dust2/Tuscan) and one relatively balanced map (Inferno.) This would have been possible even with the seven maps. however, Valve have decided that that's not what they want. Old Nuke makes no sense anymore.","Cobblestone is t sided, and overpass is pretty ct sided. Inferno literally just went out for a remake. See the thing is, what valve wants isn't necessarily a good thing for the game. Often it's actually super shit, the pistols, newke, R8, jump scout, rifle nerf etc.\n\nMirage isn't super ct sided, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it balanced. It's not like every map is super balanced, not every map is inferno. ","I checked out the stats on hltv, and according to the last 3 months of professional play:\n\ncache: 50.4% T sided\n\n**inferno: 53.55% CT sided**\n\ntrain: 52.71% CT sided\n\ncbble: 50.8% T sided\n\noverpass: 51.52% CT sided\n\n**mirage 54.26% CT sided**\n\ndust2: 51.53% CT sided\n\nNo map is more than 55% sided either way, but Mirage and Inferno both stand out as being the least even (not that it's necessarily a bad thing).","I'd be curious to look more into the specifics regarding those stats because it seems strange to me. But I guess that's all I have to say.","Nobody is saying \"make Nuke perfectly balanced\", the problem was always \"please make Nuke not have 13-2 halves\". Not being balanced doesn't mean being unbalanced as shit. The entire map basically came down to \"who wins there pistol rounds\".","The silo wasnt exclusive to people who learnt the jump, it was a boost. It was as accessible as it is today you just need a teammate, the point of the jump is to reward people who took time to learn it. It's like in cache CT mid boost, do you want a ramp from the garage thing to the boost? No, because its a boost and the jump was an alternative just like in the Silo. ","But if Cache was ridiculously CT-sided, and FMPONE was looking to make changes, he would definitely consider making the boost possible to reach without a boost.","There's a big difference between those boosts. Cache boost is basically on the way to the bombsite, whereas the nuke boost is a huge delay","What is wrong with having ct sided maps? I think it just adds to the game and makes advanced tactical teamwork on the t side more important, which is, what cs is about.","If a map is too ct sided pistol rounds start to matter too much. I dont think a map should average more than 10-5 a half","CT sided is okay, Nuke-level \"win pistol to get a 13-2 half\" CT sided is shit. Valve overreacted with Nuke but that doesn't mean the complaints were wrong.","I never said that something was wrong with CT-sided maps, which is most of the game, I think, it's that ridiculously CT-sided maps (60% and above) are not fit for the current map pool. They would have worked great in 1.6, but not in GO, where the most unbalanced map currently is Overpass. ","On nuke at anything above a mediocre skill level you wouldn't just have people trying to execute or push on one site/area. Someone would play ramp another dick around in hut while someone tries to catch a pick outside; this let people do the boost to try and get onto silo if they were bad @ movement. \n\nThe issue isn't the stairs its the fucking massive wraparound catwalk the CTS cant do anything about.","you have never had to do a jump to get onto silo. have a teammate boost you if you can't make it.\n\nit rewards movement skill (although the movement in go sucks anyway) by allowing the self boost but in no way does it prevent a team who cant do the jump from playing silo.\n\nnot to mention that removing the stairs doesnt make the jump any harder, it just makes the easy was slower\n\nthe issue i  DO have with the change is that it has no effect on real cs because the 'hard' jump is too easy. silo/redrock was probably already a little too easy to make a significant difference for any competent team but it was at least failable. the new 'hard' jump isn't even that.","I don't think the removal of stairs would reward movement much, just be a nuisance. However, I would like to see the hard jump back, and I'll explain my reasoning.\n\nEveryone should invest time into developing good movement, and they should be rewarded for doing so with faster access to difficult areas to reach. Adding the stairs up to Silo would be like adding a railing to reach the Cache self-boost. You can reach both jumps with a simple boost from your teammate, but you are rewarded with faster positioning and independence by having good movement.\n\nRegarding your thoughts on the map being too CT sided. I agree that it was, but making the Silo skill-jump easily accessible was not the right move, in my opinion. I'd rather they just take away some of the CT's angles rather than adding new paths.\n\n&gt;A site looks dope as it is.\n\nWell, yeah, the map looks great, but it's more about the gameplay. Evening out the A site is something that should have been in from the start. I don't see any reason as to why it wasn't smooth from the beginning, it's just a small annoyance if you get stuck on it. The railing sometimes blocks bullets and nades, so if they make this like the railing on Cache's Catwalk, it should be fine. In its current state though, the hitboxes are out of wack, and the railing is hardly penetrable. It should be an easy fix, though.","The problem is it's not a little perk of being good at movement, it was a legitimate balance change. If Cache was really CT-sided for some reason, FMPONE might make the boost able to do just by jumping. Someone at Valve said \"Hey, we need to make Newke more balanced! How do we do that?\" and someone replied \"Howabout we give Ts easy access to silo! It'd really help them hold outside easier!\"\n\n\nSo they did. It shouldn't just be one of those small perks like the surfing stairs in overpass or the small mini-boosts in Inferno, it should be what it is, because it's a legitimate balance change. Also, I get your point about A-site. It still looks really fucking cool, though.","I suppose there are two sides, and I understand your point. To be honest, I don't really have a big problem with it. It's more that I feel like Outside plays out weirdly, so I'm just looking for something to complain about :3.","Can we have some pics ? :)\nBtw great ideas","[Just for you](https://imgur.com/a/0SvNO)","Don't think they should remove the stairs. It kinda goes against what they were trying to do in the first place.","thx :)","I don't see the point of the white tarp. It's not exactly hard to spot people against a yellow background. ","I agree, both Ts and CTs stick out like sore thumbs against the pure yellow backdrop.","Plus the tarp looks like ass comparatively ","2.\ntbh the tarp isn't the issue at hand. the issue is where the secret/oldtoxic door is. the fact that t's can just jump and be safe from ramp is just stupid, it gives such an incentive to go B. move the door deeper into the site and you'll see less unwinnable CT rounds.\n\n\n\n4 that railing isnt going to solve the issue that is the massive red box outside blocking cts from doing anything.","I agree on removing or lessen the design of the railings above in A-site. \n\nAlso the railings on catwalk outside, they should also remove some of that.\n","Tarp added to improve what visibility? It just looks ugly as hell with the tarp.","With #4, that is the slow way up anyways.

I often use them as cover towards the back of garage if I am clearly against inferior opponents, they are a part of my arsenal to defend the outside area while still being able to retreat.\n\nBut if the visibility suggestions are not only for less clutter but to make the sort of cheeky shit I do less prevalent then I am all for it.\n","This would make it sooo much less laggy","This \"rewarding movement\" shit is so dumb, do you really not understand they don't want strafing to be a requirement to get on the silo?\n\nThey want 100% consistency on terrorists being able to get there and be an early threat on any round.","strafing wasn't ever a requirement to get on silo, you could always just boost","Which they obviously don't want either","yeah forgot, teamwork is too hard for a lot of people, my bad","I understand exactly what they're trying to do, I understood what they were trying to do with the R8 as well. Doesn't mean I agree with it.","I don't know, most of the people I've seen complain about the improvement of the silo jump are people who knew how to do it, and are just miffed that they're not special anymore.\n\nBesides, now that the catwalk's been lengthened and CT's can get to Mini Roof just as easily as T's, what's the point of making it a skill jump, now that Silo and Mini Roof are no longer overpowered positions? It just gives T's an unnecessary roadblock.","Holy shit this video was to fast for me","Literally all you have done is make the map uglier without making it better. The only thing that I could see increasing visibility is the removal of those pipes. That tarp removes one of the nicest looking areas in the game for what? If someone was standing there without the tarp, do you REALLY think you would miss them? The Ts and CTs models are green/brown (dark) on this map. The background is FUCKING YELLOW. You're just being pedantic for the sake of it.","Slow it down... SLOW IT DOWN!","The stairs, I don't see the point in removing them, and the pipes, I think they are not there randomly. ","Nah, they are more focused on removing my fps","The second you brought up removing the stairs to reward movement was when I stopped watching.","I disagree with all of the points you made.","hey guys! so i scrolled around this comment section and made a good  visualisation of what nuke should be according to the fans \n[here] (http://imgur.com/fIHtMcN)","&gt;reward movement\n\nThat's the dumbest thing I've read all week.","Also remove unnecessary props, I counted and there's 25 fire hydrants and 37 cords in this map.","I just want the old nuke back. I honestly think this new one is complete bullshit. I do like the new textures tho.","the old one had like 70% CT winrate so it was clearly not okay.\n\nthis new one on the other hand has way too many angles and visiblity is really bad, also it is a littl eheavy on the hardware too. ","If they couldve taken old nuke and gotten the winrate down to like 65% instead of like 75%, then it would have been OK. Either way, old nuke was by far better than new nuke.","I don't like how overly colorful the map is. It hurts my eyes sometimes. I do really enjoy your suggestions though, especially removing those stairs on roof to reward movement. One of the biggest problems I have with Nuke is that they removed the areas that required skill to get to. Boosting onto Silo. Strafing onto Mini Garage. The little skill based spots that could make or break a game depending on a player's knowledge of game mechanics. I do understand why they did it and it makes the map user friendly at most ranks. But as a Silver player who's trying his hardest to learn bhops, strafes, and boosts, I didn't put in that effort only to have those spots available to everyone whether they know how to do it or not. ","You can still have a few seconds advantage by skill jumping it.  \n\nAnd I would also not recommend learning bhops and strafes if you purely doing it to get a advantage at your level as time on aim and game sense is much more valuable. ","I know that it's not important at my level but I get bored sometimes and practice in bot matches just to know when I do need it. It still feels disappointing though that most of the work I put in was replaced in a single patch by stairs and walkways.","I was thinking about this yesterday.\n\nInstead of removing the stairs, move the walkway away from silo just far enough that you at least have to jump from on top of the railing. \n\nmy controversial ideas were to make the shorter ladder there go through the roof into the squeaky room, and to remove the ladder and hole in heaven/hell, and place a ladder from the lower roof outside heaven to that part of the catwalk.  that way, CT's can/have to jump up the yellow barrels to get into heaven","From a competitive view-point, I think these changes are necessary:\n\n* Outside rafter - Silo rafter connecting to annex roof is fine, but the rafter around the corner leading to heaven should only be accessible by terrorists using a run boost/standing boost (doesn't have to be as hard as it was before)\n\n* Do not allow the bomb to be planted on top of the bombsite silos\n\n* The map needs to be optimized a little bit better (Sorry I can't suggest how)\n\n\nOther suggestions:\n\n* Colour scheme: I did like the old colour scheme. The new nuke feels just a touch too vibrant for a competitive first person shooter. I'm sure there's a middle ground that can be reached.\n\n\n\n","Suggestion: Delete this abortion of a map ","Answer me, you shit.","Are you thinking of the jump between catwalk and mid window or mid window to ladder room or something?\n\nThe one from balcony to apartment window is a gimmick. If someone is waiting in kitchen and staring out at the door, you have no cover whatsoever inside the window, and you fall out outside of it. It's good if it's unexpected but idk what you are even talking about with regards to it being faster or giving you a positional advantage ","[removed]","lol ok. It's really not important but u can just blame rank if u want, bc u have no actual logic.","well movement is extremely important in cs, and it definitely should remain that way","Maps should be CT sided anyways??","Maps should be CT sided, but GAMES should be 50/50. Nuke was previously 60/40 even taking into account the T weapon advantage.","If the map is T sided then what's the point?\n\nThe catwalk between heaven and silo should've never been added, neither should the walkway to silo","You misunderstand. Terrorists have a massive advantage with better weapons, no need to buy defuse kits, and cheaper everything.\n\nTherefore maps need to be CT sided in order to balance this out.\n\nSo the map should be CT sided enough to counter the cheaper weapons and 1tap headshots the Ts have access to. This isn't the number we see however:\n\nWhen someone says old Nuke is 60% CT sided, they mean that the CTs win 60% of the rounds on nuke. This means that the map was HUGELY CT sided: even with their much better weapons, the Ts didn't stand a chance. This was no fun to play and no fun to watch, so valve made the map MORE T sided (but not even close to being T sided overall).\n\nIt's like how Dust II has almost exactly a 50% winrate for both sides. It's still a CT sided map design in that the CTs have easier angles to hold to counter the extra power Ts have. Do you understand now?","Not even talking about old nuke though\n\nMaking the map AND the economy T sided just makes it tilted more towards the T side, rather than balanced\n\nI get what u mean, I'm just sayin that catwalk between heaven/silo + essentially a stairway to silo shouldn't exist if the map wants to be ~50/50","The map isn't T sided. It's more T sided than before, yet before was horribly CT sided. It's actually about even now when you take the economy into account. The catwalk isn't even that good: the person watching outside can easily pick off Ts using it (no cover), and all they did was simplify the Silo jump: you could do it easily before but you had to practise. Waste of everyone's time.\n\nAll they did was remove bullshit like CTs being ANYWHERE in A rafters, or one of like 10 entrances into B site. It makes it more fun to watch and play while being pretty well balanced.","wow so many salty people who never made the jump\n\nif you want to become good at something, you gotta invest time into it like EVERYONE else did it who can make the jump","https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4g1ca7/what_we_all_hope_valve_doesnt_do_to_the_new/d2dxvmg\n\nnot everyone agrees","Quoting launders does not make up for your lack of reading comprehension.\n\nFirst of all, i agree with launders in the quote you took out of context to use to prove yourself right instead of using your own words and explaining your reasoning. i know its easier to quote community members so you don't even have to bother typing or thinking for yourself.\n\nLet me break it down for you, in the context of the current map, making it take longer to do the catwalk jump to boost is pointless because the current \"fast\" way of doing it does not actually require any strafing, it is not a hard jump that requires KZ practice.\n\nIn fact it is even easier than it looks because the hitbox of the pipe actually protrudes past it so you can completely miss the yellow valve and still hit the jump.\n\nLaunders is correct that the old nuke jump was not \"to hard\" and that putting thousands of hours into something their should be some reward to learning how to strafe. However the OP and your approach to this on the current nuke is incorrect, if you want to make the current jump \"hard\" again you would need to do multiple things.\n\nYou would need to change the elevation levels of the roof to match the old nuke, remove the catwalk entirely, remove the AC units and the yellow pipe that currently allow for \"fast boost\" that is a total joke to anyone who has spent 5 minutes on a kz server.\n\nYet still with all that being said, nuke has far larger design flaws that need to be addressed that have precedence over the current boost issue.\n\nThe map is poorly optimized with gigantic amounts of unnecessary rooms and scenery that cause major FPS issues.\n\nThe butchering of the outside area is completely ham fisted to make the map more T sided, which is arguable that T sided maps do not need to exist and cause ridiculously sloppy CS. With how CT economy works with kits and more expensive guns causes sloppy CS with tons of half and forcebuys from the CTs. Cobblestone is a big problem and not a very good map, and should have been a key indicator that making a map heavily T sided with one area of the map being extremely easy for the Ts to plow the CTs on has major design flaws.\n\nAll the hidden walls and hitboxes that grenades are bouncing back off, the inconsistencies of sound with some metal sounding like concrete and vice verse.\n\nThe list goes on and on, the map is a disaster.","[deleted]","Gotta say I love when a reddit comment says something about reading comprehension then has multiple grammar and spelling mistakes throughout it.

And [good falafel](http://bahnans.com/), of course (a must for any city). There's a great new [hipster-y/crunchy-granola bread bakery](http://www.birchtreebreadcompany.com/) too.

What he is accused of smacks of corruption to me though maybe there is another, better, word to describe it.\n\nBut I want to call this part out from the article:\n\n&gt; The mayor insisted that as a union leader he was not one for hardball tactics, such as erecting inflatable rats outside nonunion construction sites. “That’s in the past,” he said. “It’s a business now. I don’t agree with those tactics.”\n\nWhy is that a \"hardball\" tactic from \"the past\"? That's protesting and activism is it not? It's actions that occur, at least, not behind closed doors with deals made unbeknownst to most union members so that should be a plus, no? Did the former Union leader forget where the roots of the Labor Movement drew its strength and influence? To me, it's far less \"hardball\" than calling up developers and threatening them but...perhaps I am in the minority on this one.\n\nAs a resident of Boston, this whole story is yet another thing to put on my list of reasons why I won't vote for Walsh in the next election. I truly hope Tito Jackson or Ayanna Pressley run next go-around because where there is smoke there is usually fire.

Re-electing Walsh should be out of the question for voters but time will tell. People have this annoying habit where they forget shit like this.","I wish I had known Walsh would run for mayor so we could've saved the voicemails he'd leave us.\n\nHe was a bully and jackass.\n\nAlso fun little fact, \"Scabby\" the Rat that they haul around and inflate at protests is built at a non-union textile mill in the Midwest.","&gt; Also fun little fact, \"Scabby\" the Rat that they haul around and inflate at protests is built at a non-union textile mill in the Midwest.\n\nHa!","its not corruption when you live in an Oligarchy, this is business as usual.","Yeah, fair enough.","With you on Walsh.

When I was an SEIU member at Harvard, I personally beat up 2 anthropologists and 3 associate registrars until they accepted my grading curve policy. \n","Remember, dude, **every time**.","Seems like we both have a similar outlook on unions even if we came to different conclusions about them. I think it is better to have worker protection than to not have it. However, I think unions need to be drastically re-evaluated. When you can't tell where management ends and union begins - that's a problem. When unions decided to throw their support behind one of the two main political parties - that was a problem. Their real power and influence came from being outside of systems of power and threatening it rather than being co-opted by it. And when union presidents/leaders earn much more than the workers they represent, that is absolutely a problem but that's part of being co-opted by systems of power.\n\nAnd aside from police and maybe fire unions, I don't think there is that much bullying going on overall though I admit if it happens even once that's a bit of a problem as they come off not looking any better than the corporatist/capitalist agenda that they should be protesting against and I definitely don't think they have the numbers.","&gt;  And when union presidents/leaders earn much more than the workers they represent, that is absolutely a problem\n\nI'm not sure how this is a valid complaint. The unions are businesses. Their commodity is labor. Running a successful business requires competent leaders, which almost always means significantly higher pay.\n\nIn fact, most complaints against skilled labor unions (not necessarily from you, just in general) stem from failing to realize that they're just another market competitor looking to run a successful business.","&gt; The unions are businesses. \n\nThat's my complaint. They ought not behave like one. The struggle is against businesses and to become like them is where they begin to be co-opted and rendered ineffective, I believe.\n\n&gt; Running a successful business requires competent leaders, which almost always means significantly higher pay.\n\nSure for business but unions should be about solidarity and union presidents, in my opinion, ought to be paid the average of the salary of those they represent. Because in my experience, being in meetings and labor negotiations with union reps, they are all too willing and eager to agree with management **or** they just want to maintain the status quo. Never demanding more. Maintain the status quo and if something goes away, something must be put in it's place to *appear* to be going to bat for their membership but it's a farce. Usually what was taken away was much more meaningful to their workers than what was given. Their pockets are full, they are rubbing elbows with other people of power and I believe that many of them forgot where they came from. But that's just my lived experience so take that as you will. \n\nMaybe if Union presidents or leaders weren't earning big bucks, they'd be less likely to bend over and grab their ankles or agree to increasingly shittier deals on behalf of the workers they represent in the name of \"keeping good relations\" with management or systems of power. They'd be more cognizant of the struggle of the working class.\n\n&gt; In fact, most complaints against skilled labor unions (not necessarily from you, just in general) stem from failing to realize that they're just another market competitor looking to run a successful business.\n\nYeah, fair enough. I think where we disagree is that while I agree they operate *like* a business, that's exactly where I think they begin to lose their way.\n\n","&gt; That's my complaint. They ought not behave like one. The struggle is against businesses and to become like them is where they begin to be co-opted and rendered ineffective, I believe.\n\nThey've *always* been businesses. They faltered when their leadership stopped understanding this and started protecting inefficiency. That's when they got their bad reps and started losing jobs in the 70s and 80s. Strong arm tactics and inefficient workers is why they've lost so much marketshare.\n\nIn the last decade or two, unions leaders have started to realize the only way to be successful is to get back to running successful businesses. The only way they're going to hang on to market share is to provide a product (labor) deserving of its higher price. This works particularly well for skilled trades, as they can provide a higher quality of training, with a known standard, than their non-union counterparts.\n\n&gt;Sure for business but unions should be about solidarity and union presidents, in my opinion, ought to be paid the average of the salary of those they represent. Because in my experience, being in meetings and labor negotiations with union reps, they are all too willing and eager to agree with management. Their pockets are full, they are rubbing elbows with other people of power and I believe that many of them forgot where they came from. But that's just my lived experience so take that as you will.\n\nPaid the average salary? So you want leadership getting paid less than half of the people they're representing? That's how you get terribly unskilled leaders protecting terribly unskilled laborers and losing jobs to non-union labor.\n\n&gt;Maybe if Union presidents or leaders weren't earning big bucks, they'd be less likely to bend over and grab their ankles or agree to increasingly shittier deals on behalf of the workers they represent in the name of \"keeping good relations\" with management or systems of power. They'd be more cognizant of the struggle of the working class.\n\nBut they're not grabbing their ankles for shittier and shittier deals. It's actually keeping people employed, still with significantly better deals than their non-union counterparts.\n\nThe alternative is simply putting union laborers out of work, as demonstrated by the failures of the UAW.\n\n&gt;Yeah, fair enough. I think where we disagree is that while I agree they operate like a business, that's exactly where I think they begin to lose their way.\n\nIt's really when they stopped operating like businesses that they lost their way. The UAW is the best example of a union refusing to accept its role as a business and make smart business moves to protect its marketshare. They've put countless members out of work due to the \"old school\" approach you're advocating, rather than embracing a similar approach to many building trades that have realized the only way labor stays employed is when contractors are making money.\n\nIn the short term, sure you can fight to protect the lazy incompetent few and it keeps them employed. In the long term, keeping those few employed puts a far greater number of productive people out of work.","&gt; They faltered when their leadership stopped understanding this and started protecting inefficiency. That's when they got their bad reps and started losing jobs in the 70s and 80s. Strong arm tactics and inefficient workers is why they've lost so much marketshare.\n\nGlobalization is what played a large factor in the decline of labor unions, I would argue. Though to back up for a second, where I am coming from is someone who worked for a little while in the public sector in a heavily union work environment. Just to provide some more context here.\n\n&gt; Paid the average salary? So you want leadership getting paid less than half of the people they're representing? That's how you get terribly unskilled leaders protecting terribly unskilled laborers and losing jobs to non-union labor.\n\nI think it's worth trying out because unions, to me, shouldn't be so damn hierarchical. Instead, the attitude should be a \"first among equals\" mentality or something close to it.\n\n&gt; But they're not grabbing their ankles for shittier and shittier deals. It's actually keeping people employed, still with significantly better deals than their non-union counterparts.\n\nOh, no. That's not what I have seen in the slightest but if you have then I won't begrudge you your experience.\n\n&gt; The alternative is simply putting union laborers out of work, as demonstrated by the failures of the UAW.\n\nWhat failed them was globalization and trying to be too accommodating to capitalism. UAW was not radical enough.\n\nI do think you are minimizing the role that globalization and corporatism has had on labor unions in particular within the private sector.\n\nWithin the public sector is where most of my work experience comes with labor unions and union reps and \"protecting marketshare\" is not the aim there at all. It's about feeling important and powerful all while doing little to nothing for their union membership.\n\n","Let me start off by saying public sector unions are an entirely different animal, and shouldn't be conflated with skilled trade unions or unskilled trade unions (note: most T employees fall under skilled trades, despite operating in the public sector). I've kept to discussing skilled labor unions, as they're the only ones actually capable of providing value commensurate with their price. Public sector unions don't really have competition or marketshare to be protected, lost, or gained in the way skilled labor unions do. Unskilled labor unions (UFCW, much of SEIU, etc.) have plenty of competition and marketshare up for grabs, but little value to add unless they have a monopolistic hold on the labor supply.\n\nGlobalization hurt certain types of manufacturing in the US, yes, but it played a very small role in the UAW's failures. The UAW continually supported inefficient labor and the poor quality that comes with it. Americans cars earned a bad reputation for quality because the UAW refused to budge on those issues, and refused to realize they were partners in success with the Big Three. What's happened in the last 30 years is more an more foreign automakers have actually moved production to the US, but avoided the UAW like the plague that it is. The UAW's bullheadedness is almost entirely why they've permanently lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, and why those jobs are being replaced with more talented non-union laborers.\n\nThe contrast here is skilled trade unions like the building trades. In Boston, at the least, many of them have realized their predicament and made efforts to change so they can still make a value proposition that includes higher wages for their members. This is the only way they're going to have sustained success. Labor leaders flirting with the line between corruption and representation are temporary fixes, if they're fixes at all. If unions are hard to work with, and provide no value over non-union labor, companies that are free to choose their labor suppliers will choose non-union labor whenever they can.\n\nThis is why the UAW has failed to protect jobs. Doubling down and being harder to work with for lower quality work isn't a successful business model for unions providing labor any more than it is for OEMs providing electronics, brake pads, tires, etc.\n\n&gt;I think it's worth trying out because unions, to me, shouldn't be so damn hierarchical. Instead, the attitude should be a \"first among equals\" mentality or something close to it.\n\nGoing back to this, no successful business is run this way for very long. It's a fine mentality for startups with 10 members having different but equal inputs to the success of the business, but it doesn't work beyond that stage. Competent leadership has a price, and it's a hell of a lot more valuable than the average salary of a single employee.","Same. The days when the USA was prosperous enough to afford to have unions get away with robbing the public blind are over.

They are the ones that make up these amazing mom and pops restaurants, small shops etc. They need a place to live as well, and if the rent is too high, well all we will have is Hip Yuppies with in my opinion little to no soul.\n\nNobody is saying people don't care about low income people, but it what world do you live in that a low income person is going to be able to live in a brand new 40 story condo with skyline views?\n\n&gt;Cool, you forget to mention some of those developers are also building up in Chinatown, Columbia Point Dorchester, Egleston Square, Jamaica Plain.\n\nNobody is tearing down houses in Jamaica Plain to build apartment buildings.\n\nThe corridor down Washington Street in JP being developed is replacing parking lots and warehouses and other light manufacturing.\n\n&gt;I'd like to see that 90% stat because millennium tower,  ink block\n\nWhat was the Millennium Tower before hand, do you even remember? It wasn't apartments, and it wasn't too long ago that it was considered the Combat Zone, so I don't know why you're making it sound like families were kicked out to the streets to build an Ivory Tower for rich people.\n\nThe entire Metro area is going through a giant market correction like every other big city does.\n\nThe more you push back on developers building new housing stock, the more those people coming to work in these new jobs are going to have to rent somewhere else, so the better chance that landlord is gonna jack the rent because he knows there's ten people looking at that apartment.\n\nSupply and Demand dude, it's not hard.\n\nYou want cheaper housing and rent? Build a shitload of it.\n\n","Just go to some of the neighborhood community centers in Chinatown, Dorchester, Mattapan and ask them how rent has gone up too much in the past few years, how they are not able to afford the apartments they used to be able to afford. The towers are nice and all but they also affect the smaller housing around them. So while they may have cleaned up a plot of land that was nothing, it ends up fucking over every other apartment there by jackingup the market rate. Boston Housing Authority used to do a good job of having free/subsidized housing in housing that has expensive apartments but sets aside some for the low income people. But you see lately these new buildings, only like 10 or so apartments out of like 200 will be set aside for these people. I don't know man, I used to make 100k via a comp sci job and I still wouldn't want to pay 2k+ for a high riser studio apartment and feed the rich fuckers. I'd rather live in an old apartment owned by some person that has been in that neighborhoods for decades and support the local people. The city needs to just make sure these developers are setting aside like 30% of the apartments for low income or more it is necessary, we all need to do our part in helping bring up others in the community. There is just too many homeless and low income for me to care if there isn't enough housing for rich yuppies. ","&gt;Just go to some of the neighborhood community centers in Chinatown, Dorchester, Mattapan and ask them how rent has gone up too much in the past few years, how they are not able to afford the apartments they used to be able to afford. \n\nChinatown is sandwiched by the Theater District and Financial District. It's literally one stop away from Downtown Crossing. In what world would it be cheap to live there?\n\nThat being said they do a great job of keeping the identity, but come on dude. That's like bitching some spot on Park Avenue is expensive. You're in Manhattan, of course it is.\n\nDorchester is seeing raising rents along the Red Line, well, because it's along the Red Line. That's supply and demand dude, what's your solution?\n\n&gt;The towers are nice and all but they also affect the smaller housing around them.\n\nThe locals and landlords are the ones raising the rents on the existing housing stock, get mad at them for pushing out their own neighbors.\n\nAnd what's your honest argument against that?\n\n\"No we want to keep that old manufacturing warehouse with the environmental problems just the way it is so that our rent stays cheap?\"\n\n&gt;The city needs to just make sure these developers are setting aside like 30% of the apartments for low income or more it is necessary, we all need to do our part in helping bring up others in the community.\n\nNo.\n\nThe larger portion of the building you take and put into the hands of the government agencies, the more rent that the developer has to charge on the others that are actually on the open market.\n\nThe only way. The absolute *only* way that this works is building more housing stock. Yes, rents will rise, but that happens. You'll have to live a little farther from the city to afford it.\n\nKeep in mind the only reason most were able to afford it to begin with was because \"white people\" left in the 1970s for the suburbs when the schools went to hell.\n\nWell now there's a generation of white people who are putting off having kids so they don't care about the schools, they care about not sitting in traffic going to/from work. They care about living close to downtown so they can walk to work and have bars and restaurants closebye.\n\nNeighborhoods have *always* always been organic and evolving. I don't know why now it's this things where they have to be stuck however they are now forever.\n\nMattapan used to be Jewish, the North End used to be called the \"Black Sea\" full of sailors and degenerates. Part of Beacon Hill used to be black. Eastie used to be Irish. It's all different now. It'll all be different in twenty years.\n\n","I love how you mention white people are the ones moving into downtown, which clearly shows these other colors clearly can't afford these areas. This clearly shows there is income inequality between races. I'm sorry I am a man of color, so I live in this world of problems a colored person has to face, so you'll never understand life from my eyes or the struggle my people face.","&gt; I love how you mention white people are the ones moving into downtown, which clearly shows these other colors clearly can't afford these areas. \n\nI also mentioned why these areas are desirable. Chinatown is prime real estate. So is East Boston.\\\n\n&gt; This clearly shows there is income inequality between races.\n\nOh dear.\n\nYes, there's also not a perfect distribution across all industries.\n\nAsians and Indians are a smaller minority than African Americans *and* may have a language barrier, yet there's definitely an income inequality there because they probably make *more* than white people.\n\n&gt; I'm sorry I am a man of color, so I live in this world of problems a colored person has to face, so you'll never understand life from my eyes or the struggle my people face.\n\nAnd so what are you proposing?\n\nStop economic growth?\n\nStop adding jobs?\n\nOr it's only okay if white people only displace white people?\n\nAnd only colored people can struggle?\n\nI went to college with some of \"your people\" who's parents were doctors and had everything handed to them.\n\nI went to funerals with some of \"my people\" who grew up poor and found their way into drugs.\n\nI used \"white people\" in quotes because it's colloquially known as \"The Great White Flight\" when they left, which is what created the opportunity for affordable housing for many minorities in pockets of downtown to begin with.\n\nSo, you know, markets are cyclical. The market went down and created an opportunity, and now it's rebounded and I'm sorry you're at the age where you can't benefit from it like the previous generation did, but it is what it is.\n\nIt's like complaining the Celtics are doing better because now tickets are expensive.\n\nIt's economics dude.\n","T-minus one hour until comments about Walsh's corruption and ineptitude begin.\n\nT-minus one hour and one day until the same commenters flip back to shitting all over the Globe.","Aside from all of the \"T-minus\" stuff you're posting, how do you feel about this? You're a Boston resident as I am. This is your mayor and I am going to assume that you have also been paying attention to his tenure so far so you know this is the first of many things he's either said or done that have been questionable.\n\nSo, what's your stance on this?","&gt; Aside from all of the T-minus stuff you're posting\n\nI made one comment. I don't think that suggests that I'm a serial poster along a particular line.\n\n&gt; This is the first of many things he's either said or done that have been questionable.\n\nI don't accept that premise. My impression has been that Mayor Walsh has been choosing his positions on issues based on what's most likely to get him reelected. And when public sentiment on an issue has changed during his tenure, so too has his position (see: Olympics). To that end, I think this is absolutely not the first time in which something he's said or done has been questionable, but then, I don't agree with him on many things, so it's only natural for me to say that.\n\nFor the record, I didn't vote for Walsh in the primary (Consalvo), and I didn't vote for him in the general, so I'm not predisposed to support him anyway.\n\nAll that said, my comment was more a defense of the Globe than anything else. My expectation was that people would come in here and use this article as evidence of misconduct or questionable behavior by the mayor. And then only 24 hours later, return to shitting all over the newspaper that brought said evidence to light. It was an observation of the irony of throwing stones at the major press in the city within a day of using their work to throw stones at something else.","&gt; And when public sentiment on an issue has changed during his tenure, so too has his position (see: Olympics).\n\nYou mean the 15 minute warning press conference he hastily put together when Baker was giving his presser at the top of the hour after Baker made the decision he was taking the olympics away from Walsh?\n\n&gt; And then only 24 hours later, return to shitting all over the newspaper that brought said evidence to light. \n\nI think /r/boston is very favorable of the real journalists on the Globe. It is Henry and his abortive stance of 5 articles a month before you have to pay to see ads and the columnists. The columnists that are there for clickbait and not actual reporting.

The original Arab ethnicity emerged in the southern Arabian peninsula but through the expansion of Islam and the concept of the Ummah (shared Muslim identity) the ethnicity expanded to include many different people.\n\nThere's actually a lot to be said for many of the intra-Arab conflicts throughout the last 500 years stemming in no small part from the highly heterodox composition of the Arab identity. When you think about it, \"Arab\" as an ethnic group is actually quite unique in that it incorporates other ethnic groups within it.  Anyone who's every been to the Middle East and North Africa could tell you that Egyptians are very different from Saudis who are very different from Moroccans.  The distinctions obviously dont fall on synthetic nationhood lines, but there are clearly sub-ethnicities within the Arab ethnicity.","Most do but some don't, the Berber Algerians don't.","Of course, most do. A very small minority don't. \"Riyad Mahrez\" is an Arab name, and many Arabs look up to him on TV.

I always root for my African teams in international competitions. \n\nAt the end of the day the country is on the continent of Africa and I've grown to be see the image of Africa and hold some level of nostalgia. I wasn't born in Algeria(or anywhere in Africa) but whenever I look at a map and I see that big land mass under Europe, I know that's where my heritage lies. \n\nBut Algeria is an interesting place in itself because there are people within Algeria that might be quick to say that they aren't Arab either lol. There is another ethnicity in Algeria(The Berber people that is.

Personally, I think the fact that defence is so based on organisation and tactics means that it's incredibly difficult to put a part of a successful defensive unit up for an award over say a striker or winger who will dismantle defences to win games. ","But if you compare Spurs' defence last year and this year, and note it's Alderweireld whose the big change, you can pretty safely assume he's been doing a bang-up job.","I understand that but look at united this year. I'm a united fan myself and despite the fact we have about a million clean sheets I recognise that our defensive, oppressive style of play is what has contributed partly to Smalling's purple patch.","But Spurs don't play defensive football, as you can see by the fact we've scored the most in the league.

","Overrated? He came into this year with people doubting he can repeat the form from last year, people continually disregarding him calling him a \"one season wonder\" ","The flashy winger will always win over the hardworking defensive midfielder. The fact that Kante is even nominated is already great recognition, as defensive midfielders who barely score rarely gets nominated here (see: Dembele). ","Kante is honestly your best player. I haven't seen a midfielder be so present defensively and offensively for a team like he is. ","Fully deserved IMO, he was incredible all year but especially in those first 6 months or so. He performed in all the big games like, City away, Chelsea at home and was there when Leicester needed him most. I remember he turned one of the most consistent defenders of the league and who Gary Neville described as the \"best\" only a season ago in Azpilicueta to dogshit that game. He has 17 goals and 11 assists in the league and his ability to glide and dribble past players with sheer ease reminds me only of Messi.

Those points could have changed the season but we forgive Toby because he is a vital part to the team.

Of all the players in Premier League history I'm glad to see the back of, it's him.

How do you hate him ?","Yeah apart from his first season when he was hit and miss he was sensational during his whole Chelsea career. The main thing for me that stood out was that when there was a high ball played into him, he just had this uncanny knack of beating the defender to the best position to receive the ball. He would do it time and time again and due to his strength he was able to hold off defenders to get others into play.

Arsenal fans would be the first ones to say they'd trade in Giroud (great build up play, but doesn't score enough) for a high scoring ST.\n\nAlso, the guy said \"top class\" seasons. I wouldn't call 12 goals a top class season unless he made up for it with plenty of assists. No doubt he was a great player, but Chelsea fans have their head up their ass if they think Drogba was a dynamic all dominating ST every season he was at the club. He was a big game player with great strength. Top ST, but not every season.\n\nOf course, the same revisionism that new fans use (before you ask, yes I'm old enough to have watched most of Drogbas seasons) to justify poor stats, fans of clubs will use to hype up older players.","&gt; Goals are a pretty big part of being a ST though, regardless of other factors.

No. Like I've said before, I do rate him and as an Arsenal fan I'm fully aware of what he's capable of, but he had very few seasons of showcasing he could be the best. His best season he had (in terms of goal-scoring), he was up against an In-Form Rooney as well.\n\nLike I've said before though, my point is that he was never **the** best in the League and wasn't consistently at his \"cup final/important game\" best, which is why it was understandable that he never won the PFA Player of the Year.","&gt;  in somewhat similar setups. I\n\nNo way, drogba's role was to be a one man attack, a battering ram occupying the opposing defenders in a conservative system to hold up the ball long enough against entire defenses by himself till chelsea get bodies forward more than to bang them in. Giroud is the target/link up player in a  attacking system *with lots of support*. ","Drogba was always a beast but his impact benefitted Chelsea more than stats could tell which I feel like really influence who wins it usually.","He was great especially in big games. I feel like his stats didn't reflect how good he was and number of goals and assists plays a big part in these awards.","Plus think how much work mou makes him do relative to other prolific strikers ","Drogba was a big game player. You remember him because he was immense in the biggest games. Not discrediting him, he is one of the best. BUT his overall game across a while season wasnt as good as his best performances, its also worth mentioning Ronaldo tore up the league during Drogbas best years. ","Drogba was their main striker and was great for them, but he was never really their best player imo. I can definitely see why he never won player of the year. ","I think it's because Drogba truly delivered in cup matches as opposed to the league.\n\nIf there was a player you could count on in a final or in a big occasion it was Drogba ","It's a league award, and as consistently brilliant as he was in cup finals, he only scored more than 12 league goals twice. Maybe stats don't paint a full picture, but a striker never has a top class season with 12 goals.","Drogba only scored 20 goals I think once maybe twice. Let's be fair there were better strikers in the league just about every season he played. He was a great striker but he was always a level below the top guys. For example you'd never take him over Henry or Van Nistelrooy for example ","Disagree completely. Drogba was unplayable and scored in almost every cup final Chelsea won. They wouldn't have been anywhere nearly as successful the past decade without a striker like him. \n\nHe may not have had the same amount of goals as Henry but you bet he's one of the reasons why Lampard was able to score as much as he did (besides penalties). The center backs were too tied up with Drogba. ","Yaya was our best player 2013-14.","Very true, but nobody other than Suarez was ever gonna win it that year","31 goals, and he missed the first quarter of the season due to a ban. No question he was the winner.","No penalties... fucking monster\n\nOh so so glad he is in La Liga now...","Gerrard took and scored 10/11 penalties that season. If Suarez had taken and scored even half of them, he would've broken the 42 game season record too. ","Who holds the record though?  Cristiano? ","Alan Shearer 34 goals - 42 game season\n\nAlan Shearer, Ronaldo, Suarez 31 goals (joint record) - 38 game season","I'm not glad :(","One of the greatest seasons, if not the greatest ever in EPL history. Never seen someone do to a team what Suarez did to Norwich. ","Wijnaldum to Norwich?","He only missed five games due to the ban and didn't miss any due to injuries, so he actually played a pretty average number of games","He also didn't take any penalties which is almost unheard of for a top scorer in the PL. Gerrard scored 10 out of our 11 penalties that season. If Suarez had taken and scored even half of those, he would have absolutely smashed the record for even the 42 game season.","It's not that special. Drogba didn't take penalties when he won the Golden Boot with 29 goals. We had eleven or twelve penalties that season too, I think. He also missed a month due to the African Cup of Nations. ","&gt;Drogba didn't take penalties when he won the golden boot with 29 goals\n\n[That's not true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP65uuZAvbg). \n\nWithout the penalty that puts him at 28 goals in 32 games, Suarez had 31 in 33. ","Right, he took a penalty but my point still stands, he wasn't the main penalty taker at Chelsea and he could've easily smashed the record for most goals in a season too. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not trying to downplay Suarez's season - he really was special that year. But there's no need to exaggerate and make it look better than it was (\"missed a quarter of the season\", \"almost unheard of\" etc). ","Except for the fact that it *is* practically unheard of- Drogba and Suarez are the only examples of it in almost 40 seasons of English top flight football.","He's almost as good as Gerrard at pens so he would have gotten close to 40, probably gotten more.","He is? Must have scored a lot for Barca then.","But he wasn't as good as Suarez 2013-14.","Oh of course not, I'm just saying to OP though that as critiqued as he is, he basically won us the league that year. Phenomenal player then.","Shouldn't have forgotten his birthday :/","Nah fuck his agent though. Causes all sorts of drama and says the shit yaya wouldnt say cause he likes that weekly pay. Hope he either shapes up or we drop him this summer.","He was very good, probably our best player but he didn't 'basically win us the league'. We had many players who were crucial to our title that year.","Scored 26 from midfield and scored in the C1C final and in the crucial penultimate game against Villa. But he's a City player so that's par for the course.","No one was beating Suarez that year ","You can't not give it to the striker who scores 31 goals and assists 21 in 33 league games.\n\nThe only argument you have for Toure is that he played the whole season, as opposed to Suarez who was banned for the first few games.","But he wasn't part of anything grand. His team didn't actually win anything. Hazard won it last year and Mahrez this year because they drove their teams to titles. Suarez was the top scorer yes but that's what the golden boot is for. Not to mention the fact that he dropped off massively towards the end and his goal scoring record against the top teams wasn't anything to write home about. ","The player of the year award has nothing to do with whether or not trophies were won. It's the best player. End of story. Who was better than Mahrez this year or Hazard last year?","Drogba should have won it in 2010.","&gt;top class seasons\n\nScoring seasons, not seasons as a whole. If you think Didier Drogba was only 'top class' for two seasons of his Chelsea career, you didn't watch Drogba.","It's really funny having an Arsenal fan saying that. ","While 'top class' is impossible to define theres no taking away from the fact that after his first big season he was seen as a bit disappointing for years and a huge amount of the chelsea fanbase wanted a better striker (but one was never brought in). It was only after his second big season when nobody expected much of him that he got this reputation he has now. And mostly thats for a few big matches while he could play most of a season in the league with poor return.\n\n[Edit: downvotes and no rebuttal. Somtimes i wonder why i try to actually discuss football here when its obv just a brigade of non football watchers]","&gt; a huge amount of the chelsea fanbase wanted a better striker\n\nDid you just make that up? Sure they wanted to have more than one world class striker, but no need to twist that to \"prove\" something. ","No. I remember it from that time. Drogba was not good enough because he didnt score enough","I think you might be the only person I've ever met with that opinion.","Its not a fucking opinion its what happened.\n\nA quick google turns up forums like this\n\nhttp://www.footballnews.com.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;amp;t=33500\n\nAnd news artlcle a like this\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/30/chelsea-didier-drogba-luiz-felipe-scolari\n\nAnd this \n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/may/13/didier-drogba-chelsea-transfer-debate\n\n\nEdit more fan forum discussions here (go on for years)\n\nhttp://forums.cfcnet.co.uk/topic/372-didier-drogba/?page=636","Did you even read the links or just copy paste searches?","First of all there were a couple seasons where Drogba was pretty poor in the Prem but great in other competitions. 11-12 being the perfect example. Despite being probably the most important player in the CL run he did essentially nothing in the league, no way he has a chance at player of the year.\n\nBut Drogba's Chelsea career is filled with revisionism these days, he's remembered for his big game performances and two outsatnding seasons but the times when he was in and out the side and his reputation as a play-acter and diving cheat have been largely forgotten about. Sure he had some pretty good other seasons but nothing anywhere close to player of the year worthy","I wasn't disputing him being 'player of the year worthy', I was disputing the assertion that Didier Drogba only had 'two top class seasons' for Chelsea.\n","Drogbas' stats don't do him justice. When he wasn't scoring goals he was still a key player to his team. Defending someone like Drogba is an absolute nightmare. He bullied center backs in the air, was fairly quick for his size and he was fantastic with the ball at his feet. The havoc he wreaked on defenses can't be translated into statistical terms which is why people have the misconception that he wasn't a top class player because he didn't bang in 30 goals a season. ","Holy fuck. An arsenal supporter every time. You guys are seriously an embarrasment on this sub. On just about every top thread you can find an arsenal supporter saying something ridiculous. Drogba was a world class player for a long time. We didn't need a 30 goals a season striker when we had lampard and winning was a bigger priority than heavy leads. He wasn't player of the year because his qualities don't make him an appealing pick but ignoring a silly award, he was a great player.","You sir, are delusional","Drogba was a quality player and for sure top class for quite a while. You sir, are the delusional one.","Drogba scored at a goal every other game for the best part of a decade.\n\nHe scored 10 cup final goals in 10 matches.\n\nAs an Arsenal fan you should know better than anybody.. Wenger still wakes up in a cold sweat thinking about Didier!","You only need one top class season to win player of that season, Mahrez has just proved that, so Drogba only having two doesn't mean he couldn't have won it for them.","Any Chelsea fan will tell u with enthusiasm how clutch drogba was in cup finals .. The rest was just icing on the cake","Arsene Wenger still wakes up in a cold sweat thinking about Didier Drogba.","13/14 I suppose he was alright. How many goals did he score in that season again? Can't have been that many.","Around 20 I think, a huge total for the role he had that season.","Wow, I forgot that. ","Come on mate. It was like 2 years ago. ","Fantastic memory.","you're gonna need a /s i think","You need to put /s, most of this sub can't pick up on blatant sarcasm.","He was your top scorer.","He was Manchester City's top scorer? Must've been a lot of own goals seeing as he was a Chelsea player. ","I'd argue there was a stretch of 3 or 4 years where Yaya was the overall best player in the PL, so it's a little surprising in my opinion, but I'll concede there's been better players on a season to season basis. RvP, Bale (his second - the first was cheap imo, but Yaya wasn't a contender IIRC) and Suarez were all deserving winners.","3 or 4 years?! \n\n","Right after he megs you. ","Is it coincidence or do Spurs like buying bent players? Nabil Bentaleb, David Bentley, Darren Bent...Whose next, Benty McBentface?","&gt; Not only do we have Forest...fans\n\nStanding by. Watched your highlights on 'East Midlands Today' all my life and now rooting for ya! My best friend moved to Leicester last September and says the place has been electric all year. Nothing but love for you guys, is what I'm trying to say...\n\n","The Netherlands also! I know so many people cheering on Leicester, myself included. \nMy team sucked this season, being relegated last year, but Leicester has made this the best season I can remember. Its something special, it really is. I try everything I can to not miss any of their matches! You guys are awesome haha :)","No, You're awesome!","Have a source to say Mahrez prefers arsenal or barca although barca is less keen from what I gather. \n\nEither way I'm just a random guy from the Internet, take what you want from it. ","Hmm what source is this? I highly doubt we'll get Mahrez, I prefer that he stays at Leicester with Kante and you lot can build on this season and establish yourself as a top4 challenging team for years to come.","&gt; I prefer that he stays at Leicester with Kante and you lot can build on this season and establish yourself as a top4 challenging team for years to come.\n\nWhy?","Its boring to see the same teams up there year after year","Yes but surely you see that if more teams are challenging Arsenal are more likely to miss out on Champions League?","Why the fuck would you go from a Prem winning team to the perpetual no.4 team in the league?","If he can take a team that was almost relegated the year before to the Prem he can surely do it with Arsenal.","That's what I thought about Ozil too ","&gt;Why the fuck would you go from a Prem winning team to the perpetual no.4 team in the league?\n\nMoney and prestige. ","He'd get neither at Arsenal. ","No chance he goes to United. ","No offence to Mahrez, but I think United are looking at a player on a level above him, like Di Maria was. It'd be next to impossible, and it'd take a world record/an obscene offer to get it done (especially because of the transfer ban looming on Atletico Madrid), but they're after Griezmann. That's the level they've been after for a while, and I think they'd go all guns blazing in this transfer window.","It was a joke about \"perpetual no.4 team in the league\"","Well, then it wasn't a joke, as United are anything but the \"perpetual no.4 team in the league.\" In fact, I seriously doubt that apart from last year, they ever finished 4th in the PL.","We've either suck badly or win the prem/come top 2 in recent years.","Didn't say he would mate","Well deserved","You're not lying...","Get out!","I've spent around 90 over three trips and you're right. I found a lot of Berber people feel persecuted/generally treated unfairly by the Arabs though.","I can confirm that. I come originally from Tunisia. Over there a lot of people hate it when they are called arabs because our ancestors were conquered by arabs in quest to spread islam, destroyed our culture, and imposed theirs. It's so complicated to explain it thouroughly. However  most of the people are okay with it due to the strong relathionship between arabic ethnicity and islam. Also technically, the word \"arab\" should only refer to people who come from the Gulf area.","barca? ","He would rot on the bench he is nowhere near good enough for the first team. Hope he stays and help Leicester next season.","Huh I think he would be the first go-to sub there and would play loads of matches. Though not fan of him going anywhere (especially to Barcelona), I think a lot of people underestimate Mahrez and Kanté just because they are part of this fairytale journey. Both of them could go anywhere imo.","&gt;Kanté\n\nKante is a different story he is a player who I could see going and holding a place on the Elite clubs.","We'll throw in a bid of €40 million, he'll have a stop start season and then there'll be some one with a Liverpool flair called /u/fowlersnose complaining that he's nothing better than a Conference North player.","Why is he a different story? Both of them are special and could walk straight in the starting 11 of all clubs bar few. ","Because Mahrez is not good enough to be a starting player for the Elite teams because of his position he has a lot of Competition unlike Kante\n\nNote: Im talking about the likes of Barca,Madrid,Bayern etc.. Mahrez for sure can be a star player and starter to the likes of Arsenal and Man united and other similar teams.","I don't really agree, Kante's a perfect fit for Leicester because he's given a lot of defensive freedom to break from position and cut passing lanes/close down players. In an \"elite team\" as you put it, a player like that would be near useless, because organisation and team movement as a unit are valued a lot, lot more highly. ","Kinda like Alexis then ","&gt;Because Mahrez is not good enough to be a starting player for the Elite teams because of his position he has a lot of Competition unlike Kante\n\nBut that is simply not true. Tell me one of those teams that has this position not covered. Barca has Busquets, Real has Casemiro, Bayern has Xabi Alonso,   Kimmich and whoever Pep decides. Although not necessarily the same type as Kanté, they would most probably not be let out by Kanté. On the other side, who does Bayern have on wings ? Old Ribery and Robben and spectacular Douglas Costa who most of people never heard before the season started? Real has Ronaldo, Bale and then who? Jesé? Is he really better than Mahrez? Or James? And Barca also needs to widen their squad, it's MSN on top all year, nobody nearly as good on the bench. I can easily see them being rotated with Mahrez, and it definitely doesn't seem to me like less probable than if Kanté did so. Also, as you said, it's 3 or 4 clubs in the world, they both would get into any team straight away bar those few, just as I said.\n\n","I honestly think that Kanté would be an upgrade to Casemiro, Xabi Alonso, Fernando/Fernandinho and Thiago Motta, when considering the \"huge\" clubs with big CL chances and all. Xabi Alonso is too old to start a lot of games, Casemiro is just straight up stupid at times, Fernando and Fernandinho are good but not quite as good and Motta has really struggled over the course of the year.\n\nTo take on part on the Mahrez debate, I think he'd be a good signing for Barca or Real, but not necessarily for PSG or City. First winger on the rotation for Barca and Real for sure.","I can see us going for Mahrez, it's well known that we need better options on the wing... But his price would be too inflated. If we are to pay 30m+ for a player, might as well go for someone better.","&gt;might as well go for someone better\n\nWho though? What wingers are out there that are available for less than 30mil, are happy to play second fiddle and are better than Mahrez? Honest question, I reckon someone like Yarmolenko, but he is untested in the \"strong\" leagues. Brahimi maybe, Feghouli? Maybe even Deulofeu or Shaqiri. But these are not quite on the level of Mahrez imo.","Nolito as a prime target this last window, and I imagine he still is.\n\nAnd if we are paying 35m+ or whatever Mahrez would cost, Reus could be bought for around the same money.","Who do you have in mind? Assuming he's available for somewhere around 35m (which, to be fair, he may well not be) there aren't all that many better options. Reus maybe? I'd imagine Griezmann would cost a fair bit more than that. ","Reus, Denis Suarez, Nolito among others.","For sure he can be a sub who is always used or as a rotational player for the top elite teams but what I mean is if he wants to play every single game then that would be hard. I guess ''rot on the bench'' is too extreme I mean if he wants to progress and plays every single game then he should stay or move up to the likes of Arsenal/man united tier teams.","Nobody is arguing that. But I still maintain that Kanté has no higher chances of getting to those teams than Mahrez. Kanté is very specific player and if he played for Barca, Real or Bayern, he wouldn't be used that much for sure, there matches when his presence would simply be unnecessary and too defensive-minded. Tho I agree that they both should stay at least a season more.","Especially Kanté. That man is the second coming of Makélélé","Fair enough dude. I hope he stays as well. ","Thats what the rumours said in january eh","tbh I have no idea where he can go. Athletico? Juve? Bayern? Don't think he'd stay in the PL. For only 400k, thats a bargain. Like one of those cheap gems you discover on FM ","I think he'll stay at Leicester next year and play in the Champions league, but I'm sure he would get into lots of top teams.

If I remember correctly, Hazard was expected to kick on before the season started and assert dominance. In fact, there were conversations putting him in the upper echelon of players in the world.","I wouldn't be THAT surprised with the Champions League runners up possibly signing a world-class player, not really. \n\nBut the comment was more aimed at a top club possibly signing a player from a big team, and not quite believing its Mahrez in that position. \n\nEdit: Also, I wasn't talking about Hazard specifically and last year's season but a general comment about how this season has gone mate.","I understand at what your comment was aimed at, but I would be surprised if Juve pulled away Hazard from Chelsea. Not because they're not capable, but because Real would be much more likely to get him with their unlimited finances.","Sure, you're totally right, but I wasn't specifically talking about Hazard you know.

He didn't have as good a season as Suarez the year before, but he had plenty of goals and assists, and in the second half of the season literally dragged us through most games.\n\nAguero and Sanchez were also very good, but I think Hazard was consistently the best last season, and it wasn't a particularly weak year.","Nah, compared to Van Persie's last season at Arsenal, Bale's last season at Spurs and Suarez's at Liverpool, it was pretty mediocre. Even statistically it wasn't *that* impressive with 14 goals and 9 assists when you contrast it with someone like Mahrez, whose team has been far less dominant.","Well, we've got Costa to score goals and Cesc to provide assists, so his direct goal involvement may not be that impressive. However, he always plays a very important role in the build up play. \n\nStatistically, last season he got 14 goals from a relatively low 2.1 shoots per game, 9 assists with 2.6 key passes per game, plus completed 4.8 dribbles per game (65% succession rate) and 58.4 passes per game (87% succession rate). \n\nThis season so far, Mahrez got 17 goals with 2.4 SpG, 11 assists (1.6 KPpG), 3.3 DpG (56% SR) and 27.5 PpG (73% SR).\n\nI'd say they are both great player and deserved to win their awards.","Damn, every one of those players was poached shortly thereafter.","I'd probably agree with all of those, although I think Hazard was a huge reason we were dominant last year and his season was every bit as impressive as Mahrez's.\n\nYou are forgetting a few of the other POTYs in the past few seasons that probably had less of a shout than Hazard did, like Bale's first one in 2011, Rooney's the year before, and Giggs' the year before that.","Downvoted but I think you're right. Comparing him to Bale, Suarez, Kompany before and his season definitely felt less awesome.","You clearly didn't watch us last season. He was the only reason we scored goals in the second half of the season. He was good in the first, but players like Fabregas were huge at that point and were doing wonders in attack. Once Fabregas' dip in form came, Hazard was basically the only reason we ever scored goals. He started every attack, had huge roles to play in most goals, and was great in general as well. \n\nHe obviously wasn't as good as Suarez the year before, but who could beat that? Suarez was banned for a bit yet he still came back and scored 31 goals...that was unreal. ","Call me biased, but I thought Balein his final season was better. We were utter shit and he still scored 21 goals, most of which were from a long way out from what I remember - he was literally the only threat we had on the pitch pretty much every game. At least with Hazard you had Costa to pick up the slack on goals (he scored 20).","&gt; Edit: Mahrez's season is reminiscent of a certain Belgian who won it last season.\n\nNo it isn't. Hazard was fantastic many years. He wasn't a sudden one year wonder.\n","I don't think that was his point.","That was most definitely not my point. ","Your point is that he will/can suddenly turn bad.","No, no, no. I don't know where you got that from, but no. ","Then I apologise.","I don't  know anything about the award, who votes or who has won previously but I'm assuming if it's voted for by players it makes sense it will generally be a forward winning it.

He's 25 and has plenty of time to sign for one of the big sides.","I don't know what he will do but I've seen plenty of top players move to a better club. There is no certainty he or Leicester will play at the same level this year.","I'm not sure when his current contract is up, but they could make a deal with him to let him go next summer and not fight a move, if he hammers down and puts in another season. A lot like Ferguson did with Cristiano. \n\nAt the end of the day, I can't imagine Mahrez feels he needs to go now or he'll miss his chance.

Over and over. People don't *want* to be told they want their world view re-affirmed. I mean, it's now fairly widely accepted that FFP would maintain the status quo rather than even the playing field but at the time people would just say \"You're just saying that cos you're a City fan.\" \n\nI used to write quite a bit about football business, finance and sponsorships. It's something I have been involved in to some degree so I reckon I've got better knowledge than most on here. Or most fans anywhere for that matter.

FFP was a bit of a mess as you said but he was basically just being defensive of his team in a long winded way about it, very little of what he said turned out to be accurate. It was what he wanted to be right because it meant his team came off better from it and in the end it didn't work out that way and you got the fine and restricted squad or whatever it was. I'm sure some of what he said was right but the big arguments and major points he was making didn't really turn out to be right at all. It was an example of his biggest problem really other than his inability to deal with dissenting views/criticism: his blue tinted glasses were far too strong and so anything he said City related had far too much bias getting in the way sometimes and colouring his otherwise good content.

Funnily enough I don't see people foaming at the mouth over those deals.)\n\n2.) He said we would not fail on the value of the Etihad deal. He was right. We failed on a payment c£18m related to inter-club licensing royalties.\n\nHe was principally wrong because he believed what *the club* itself believed. Not what he'd heard in a pub or read in an article written by a \"journalist\" with no more knowledge than is available to the public. He was wrong because he had an *informed* opinion - one held by some of the people that actually wrote the thing. \n\n&gt;It was what he wanted to be right\n\nWell conversely, most of the clowns naysaying his every word were saying what *they* wanted to be right.

And he was wrong (in a big picture sense), he had decided that was how it was and so he wouldn't listen to anything else. I'm sure he's right about the City people being more knowledgeable than us but either what he thought they were trying to do was wrong in some ways or they failed at pulling it off completely. \n\nThe people he was arguing with mostly were arguing from places of ignorance and wanting teams like City to be punished but if you're going to get on your high horse and tell everyone how stupid they are with complete certainty in your convictions well you're not going to look too clever when those convictions turn out to be wrong. His problem wasn't really his opinion and beliefs, it was the strength of them and the attitude he delivered them with. Which really is what divides everyone on the guy - no one denies he knew his shit most of the time, his attitude could just stink some times and those blue tinted glasses needed the tint taken down several notches. If he had argued the FFP stuff as \"here's what I think will happen and how I think City are trying to play it\" instead of \"here's the truth you cretins\" I probably wouldn't even remember that he ultimately got it wrong. ","I didn't start out with \"you cretin,\" but I'll give you it ended that way.","I? Devineman alt or typo?","Typo I'm afraid. Unfortunately I've no way of proving it...","I thought everyone except me was Karmanaut, I guess if you're devineman then he was Karmanaut too so it checks out still. I'm on to you!","One thing I hugely admire about people from all over Africa is this shared pride in Africa as a continent. I don't see that anywhere else, not in Europe or the Americas anyway. Maybe a little in Asia, but a lot in Africa.","\"European Pride\" is... I think the word kids use these days is \"problematic\". ","It shouldn't really. Stefan Zweig described brilliantly what it meant to be european, as someone from a land of fraternity and cultural achievements.","I think because Africa is always being ridiculed and discrimated as a continent so the Africans have more defending pride and love for their continent.\n\n\n\n","Maybe it has to do with a lack of conflict between many of the countries, for example I doubt that Algeria has gone to war with Ghana, compared to Europe where many of the countries have long histories with each other. Not to say that there isn't any conflict between countries in Africa, but I doubt that any of it is as deep running as European \"rivalries\" (for lack of a better word). Then again, I'm probably completely wrong so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.","I think you might be on to something. Only a few countries in Africa have serious international rivalries; Egypt and Algeria is the only real contentious pairing, whereas countries in South America, Europe, and even Asia can have three or more serious rivals. Argentina alone has Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and England, and even South Korea has big rivalries with Japan, Australia, and North Korea. I can't think of any African countries with rivalries, even outside of football.","That's one thing I loved about the 2010 World Cup when the whole of Africa came together, cheering on Ghana when they got to the quarter-finals but then a certain Uruguayan's hand crushed the hopes of a continent...","Asia is a huge clusterfuck. No one loves one another here and there is really no collective pride. ","defenders rarely get any love with these kinds of awards. its all goals and assists","Yeah a tad bit overrated for me. He's played very well but in some games he's just gone completely missing, City away and West Ham away pop up immediately. tbf to him that may not all necessarily be down to him","What? I don't follow you... Kane is overrated because he's had a few games where he hasn't scored, yet also this isn't just his fault it's the entire team... Wow, who would have thought that?\n\nWhat part of Kane's season has made you think he's been a tad overrated? The boy broke his scoring record from last season and now he's on course for the golden boot. ","It's not just because he hasn't scored, he was completely anonymous in those games I mentioned. Even the Arsenal game at WHL he had a bright start, then was pretty anonymous until his goal. You can still play well without scoring, but those games I mentioned you wouldn't even realise he was on the pitch.\n\nLike I said I think Kane's been good this year, but in no way do I think he's been out best player like some people have been suggesting. That's where the tad overrated has come from","So deserved","Most of the difference in our improved defence comes from our CDM being way better at covering for our back four imho. Last year we were a mess in that area.","That's a little over simplified.  He is a very good player, but he is the final piece of jigsaw.  The other pieces are just as important in the defence, he was just the last piece to make it all fit together and work.","Plus I can't imagine any top team outside England would want him right now. He wouldn't significantly improve their squads and I'm sure Leicester can match whatever wage offer they make him.","I wish I was a Leicester fan just so I could feel the same emotions they're going through right now. I think I'd die of happiness if they won the league.","This is without a doubt my favorite subreddit.

Vardy and Kane probably split the votes for 2nd/3rd place, any other year one of them would have won.","I'm with you on this Womble_Don for the most part. \n\nOne of the things I disagree with is the \"macrocosm of British youth football culture\", honestly, i've been to loadsa games. I've interacted with lots of fans and so many of them, mainly the younger ones, are thick cunts. Middle class American lads from Alabama have more reasonable assessments than some of the reactionary guys i speak too. \n\nI reckon /r/ soccer is more representative of British lower middle class footy fans. The type who go to the singing stand, get fully involved but secretly in their hearts don't feel connected with the rest. They don't have season tickets, they probably go to university or do well in school. They are anti-social. They are a weeny bit above the typical LADFAN. \n\n&gt;I don't actually think there's much of a problem. \n\nMe too, I like the state of the sub. We get lots of gifs/videos of action posted seconds after the event. We have pre &amp; post match analysis of games. We have discussion about every facet of the game. The only major thing i think we're missing is some indepth tactics discussions; but i'm ok with that because i find that incredibly dull. \n","Oh yeah definitely, those are the comments that get downvoted haha.\n\nAgree with your second point too, though there's probably a mixture of those types and lad types, I fall into the lad circle which is why I have the odd controversial comment, but for the most part I do well for discussion on here - whether it's actual discussion or banter lol.\n\nAye. Not gonna lie sometimes I get pissed off with this sub, but I also get pissed off with real life football related stuff as well. There's really nothing like this subreddit in terms of sports news/highlights/discussion aggregation.","Leicester will give him a new larger contract, I'd assume. Still your right, difficult and risky to pass up on a potentially once in a lifetime $$$move for the honor/pride of staying with smaller team you helped make great","Hard to turn down the chance of winning the champions league though if he gets a chance to go to barca, madrid, bayern. Even if he doesnt always get game time a top player in my mind doesn't think like that, they are usually confident enough in their own ability to think that they will get starts and get games.","Yeah, and he's a barca fan. There are pictures of him in barca shirt and stories of how when he was young he told his friends that he is going to play for barcelona some day","He will definitely leave. Leicester won't be able to do this again next season and I think he (or his agent) knows that the offers coming in this summer will be the best he will ever recieve. ","Bigger wages is the thing that will move him and a chance to play in a great team. Of he can get paid more and play in Barcelona I think he would take it. He won't start at Barca but he could play more than Arda or Munir","I really hope they don't lose anyone. I'd love to see their counter attacking style in the champions league. ","Even though he has got a bit of \"criticism\" in 2016 then it's still fully deserved. He has made things happen for Leicester this year. ","17 goals 11 assists... those are insane numbers \"made things happen\" is one hell of an understatement","What a lesson to every player out there, playing for any team whatsoever. Fantastic! ","Well deserved","But it's edgy/hipster to like the less glamorous. Jeeeez. ","whoever got, it's team's prize tho.","That wasn't what he was asking though","Meh, someone tried to start a threas discussing the reason for Leicester's success today and was downvoted and bombarded with \"dur, because they have the most points\" comments.\n\nI frequent a few other sport subs and this one is by far the worst for just shite-talking. r/NFL, for example, is full of decent discussion yet manages to stay light-hearted and have a liberal sprinkling of jokes.","What did OP contribute to the discussion?\n\nThat's one of the most important things about asking questions on this subreddit - you'll sometimes only get decent responses if you don't expect people to do all the work for you. Asking a question isn't enough, you need to either ask several provocative questions to spark discussion, create OC giving your own answer so people can chime in with their opinions, or be completely wrong so everyone corrects you as fast as humanly possible.\n\nAgain, it's a cultural thing, and it comes down to the cultural differences and background of the NFL and English Premier League or whatever.","Our back 5 is largely the same as last year with the addition of Toby. He's made a world of difference. But you're right, I think the second year under Poch really helped and obviously Jan and Walker staying mostly healthy was the real key.","I agree with your overall point, but Alderweireld has been truly amazing this season and played almost every game","Great comment! I couldn't agree more.","Why don't they wait till the season is over to announce these awards?","as much as people from Panama consider themselves North American","He'd play every game for us, assuming we're classed as a \"top\" side","but I hope he gets an upgraded contract as a reward and incentives ","Not really going to complain about Mahrez winning it but I think if you break the record for number of consecutive scoring games and provide a good number of assists then I think you deserve the award.\n\n","Thought De Gea would get it for single handedly keeping United relevant throughout the season.","Lol relevant enough to get you to talk about us in an unrelated thread anyway it seems ","I thought Keepers could get player of the year too. Which makes it related?","You think he was better than all the other players in the short list? ","The thing is is that Kante should win it because he's been the player who contributes the most to Leicester's success both offensively and defensively, he's had a lot of crucial assists and honestly in terms of pure running with the ball and going past defenders he's equal to Mahrez, Mahrez is just fancier about it. Meanwhile Kante is also their best defensive player while being the third most important offensive piece, which I think makes him the best. You will find other tricky wingers who score and assist for fun, but there's never been a player who shares Kante's skillset.","he'll win for Most (Hair) Product used.  and he will likely repeat with Grealish being relegated at Villa","of course we're african. Anyone who says otherwise is in denial. The majority of algerians are arabised berbers anyway, who are indigenous to north africa.","Dembele is an absolute beast.  I would break the bank to get him to UTD.  It's never going to happen though.","Africa is a continent and Arab is an ethnicity, they aren't mutually exclusive.

For example, I chose not to comment separately in this thread because I haven't watched enough of Leicester to discuss his season.

","I disagree. I think Mahrez will continue to shine and go on to have an impressive career. Mahrez is 25 - time is on his side. ","Sure but I feel like he is riding a lot of talent and confidence right now in a team that is clicking well. He has been fantastic this year but I'm also seeing him linked to places like Barca. I don't think he has the football IQ for that top level. ","Footballing intelligence? Are you saying albrighton has better vision than marez? Why would you need marez to do the albrighton role when you have the albrightons of the world to do it for you? Mahrez's role requires far more intelligence. He's constantly creative. ","I mean in terms of positioning, runs, and use of space. Sure Mahrez can pull off magical moments other players can't. But I think that Albrighton does a better job opening up space for other players, sort of like Pedro's role for Pep's Barca. In general I do rate Mahrez above Albrighton, but I don't rate Mahrez as having a higher than great sense of space and positioning","I think he does. His role is different. Unlike Albrighton, he's got to be available to receive the ball, instead of making space for others. And when he has the ball, it's to do the unexpected, not the textbook football that many others in the team excel at. Okazaki, Drinkwater and him are amazing in passing and moving in small spaces. Better than Albrighton. Their interplay can be world class. ","I disagree.

","I get what you mean, and I guess it depends how you look at it.\n\nBut I just think that winning the CL is so huge that any other achievements can't really compare to it.","When we say I'd take the chance we forget that these players have some 5-6 years to earn as much as they can and then live their life on that.

In fact, MOST algerians don't speak arabic properly. Our language is made up of Berber, Arabic, French, and Spanish (Darija). Mahrez's parents spoke Darija at home. Just like Zidane's parents speak Kabyle at home. \n\nI really don't know who he would have chosen, but Mahrez is on record saying that he chose Algeria because his late father wanted him to play for the national team. His father played at the club level in Algeria, and Mahrez has been going to Algeria on holiday every year to visit family since he was a child. I'm not saying the Mahrez is not culturally french also, but he is as much Algerian as he is french by the virtue of being born to north african parents. Also, he is treated as such by french people or else they would not differentiate between franco-algerians, and other french.\n\nI'm guessing you are not an immigrant, but rarely do immigrants leave their culture behind completely and adopt another culture 100%, especially not the first generation. In time, that'll probably happen though. I'm an Algerian immigrant myself to the USA. I moved here when I was 9, and I very much identify as Algerian even though I've been here for over 20 years. My kids will be Algerian too as well as American. That's the beauty about America, it's a country of immigrants.\n\n","Mahrez is not an immigrant,  he is parents were. \n\nI know a lot of 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants who visit the country of their recent ethnic origin on holiday,  it does not make them less foreigners there. \n\nThis is also a bigger discussion which I don't really want to start now. . It's also not at all comparable with the USA which is a pure immigrant country in the first place. \n\nIn my opinion, if someone is a second generation immigrant and still feels he belongs to the country of his parents,  then this is a major failure from the country his parents immigrated to. \n\nThere is a difference between keeping your cultural heritage alive and being a foreigner in the country you were born and raised in. \n\nThis is a different discussion but considering him an African player is a stretch,  he was born and raised in France,  lived his life there,  received his football education in France. \n\nHe is very much French whether he feels like it or not. \n\n\n\n","No one said he isn't french.

This doesn't seem like just Simeone being Simeone.\n\nThis is more on the lines of a conspiracy to cheat. This wasn't a heat of the moment thing, the ball boy must have been prepared to do it to react that fast. So they probably had talked about it before. ","I'd like to see the club docked points. Maybe 6 points and a suspension for the manager or any players involved. Make it so that it's not worth the risk. ","Dock both them and any club above them in the table. Only fair way to punish this act.","and dock the first four teams in the EPL as well, just to make sure the virus does not spread.","If its true that Simeone had a pre-arranged signal to the ballboy to interrupt the game while the ball was live, that's comparable IMHO to the [Bloodgate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodgate) affair in rugby, which resulted in multi-year bans for the people involved.","I agree. I see a lot of lighthearted comments about this but the moment I heard of this incident, I was disgusted. This is blatant cheating and I agree with your assessment. At least a couple of months ban and heavy fines. He was blatantly interfering with the game illegally and used it to stop an opponent from counter-attacking. They should be embarrassed at this behaviour. What a scumbag.","Maybe it could be deemed cheating but I don't believe it warrants a double-digit game suspension...like really? You don't even get double-digit suspensions for some other forms of cheating or even violence, why should he get one for that?","Hm, on-pitch cheating is punished well enough, external cheating shows a level of intent and organization from management that deserves extra punishment. Also ball-boys have been becoming way too influential on games tbh, so I think it would be good for someone to be made an example of and make a precedent. I'm always surprised swansea as a club got no punishment for the hazard ball boy incident.","Cheating in the heat of the moment from one player, is different from premeditated cheating by the head of the team.","If that counter had tied the game it could have cost Atletico the entire league. It's a big deal.","Double digit might be a bit too much but it for sure warrants a big suspension. Showing clear intent to (a organised) cheat BEFORE the game is a very bad thing to happen and should be punished severely.","Double digit is necessary to discourage other team from doing this shit. Either a 6-10 point reduction or a double digit ban is perfect. This is almost as bad as match fixing- using external influence to stop a potential goal.","There's playing dirty and there's outright cheating which this is.

He does look like him. Wears all black all the time too!","Ball boys who do this must be banned from ever being a ball boy ever again, Diego Simeone should be suspended a couple of matches.","Ball boys shouldn't be punished that extremely. It's like committing fraud because your boss made it clear you had to for your job. That's duress, and you can't be held accountable for that in the US at least. I think that's sensible. ","I've seen ball boys do this without someone explicitly telling them to, either way, ball boys are helpers to the game, they should be completely neutral like the referees.","Unlike the referees, they're on the club payroll.","How do you know what was said to the ball boy???","Oh no, think about their livelihoods!  What will these teenage ball boys do with their life?  You can't take this away from them, they were forced to!

Guilty imo.","Haha you can see a Malaga player blasting it away into the crowd","http://i.imgur.com/Ea2TJXR.gifv","I think it's pretty obvious that he at least communicated something to the ballboy. It might have been something else though. Can't prove it without sound but it sure looks like he looks at him, then says something and then requests a stop in the game right when the ball is thrown. To me he looks very guilty here. But RFEF will find out what actually happened here.","Yeah. Why else would a ball boy randomly throw a ball onto the pitch?","I have seen ballboy stop the game before. Ask Hazard.","I'm still happy he kicked that little shit. ","He still didn't kicked him..","At this point I hope he did.\n\nAlthough yes, I don't think he actually kicked him.","Got him right in the swan ","Well, hypothetically (while I don't believe it to be the case): \"Get ready with the ball, kid!\", to be ready for a counter if the ball went out. But I find this to be a bit far fetched as his reaction to the throw is: Stop the game, ref.","I'm not sure how anyone is doubting it. He turns and shouts at the kid, and instantly the ball is thrown. Before the ball is even on the pitch he has his arms up and is shouting at the ref.\n\nI think his popularity and the fact that Atletico are viewed as underdogs to Real/Barca is making people ignore this. \n\nMourinho/Wenger would be crucified here for this.

He is even better than Simeone at this. He also always had very physical teams that played on the edge of what was allowed.","I don't think Mou did as much time wasting as Simeone, of course he did some in tight games but everyone does and it wasn't as much as this Atletico team.","I don't claim to watch Atletico games very often, but Mourinho was the king of time wasting. Not necessarily in dirty ways, although he did do that as well, but just knowing how to kill off a game. ","I agree he did time wasting but not as much as Atletico, partly because he had more talent and money in his teams (Inter and Chelsea).","Against us Mourinho did it more.

To me football is about more than just the results, it is about playing beautifully. Who wants to watch a team park the bus for 90 minutes and win off a header from a corner? That shit is terrible. I remember teams for the way they play and not neccesarilly the results.","Sorry if I'm taking this wrong, isn't that prioritising entertainment over competition? As boring as some may call it, I'd rather watch two very technically solid teams, with great defences play out a 1-1, than two crazy teams just attack after attack play out a 5-4 for example. It might be exciting but there's less skill involved. Similarly, if a team defends well and wins, they fully deserve it (barring exceptional cases) and I don't see the issue with it","Id prefer the 5-4... especially if its my team scoring 5.","&gt;Who wants to watch a team park the bus for 90 minutes and win off a header from a corner? \n\nIf it's my team and they're winning titles, they can crab walk all game so long as they get results. My team shouldn't compromise results to please neutrals.","What if you were a neutral? That's what makes the EPL so great, everyone seems like they're purposely playing shit defending (or attacking and sitting back less frequently) which always leads to more interesting football.","Sorry mate, but I couldn't give a rat's arse what you think about my team's play style. I can understand that high scoring and end-to-end football is great for neutrals, but I don't think managers or coaches should instruct players to play in a certain manner to attract more business. Results above everything. \n\nThe EPL is great for neutrals because they have the money to spend on the highest quality players and it's the best English speaking league so more people can feel they relate. Last few years Bundesliga has averaged more goals/game and I'd argue they show just as much, if not, more endeavour going forward. ","If anything, everyone hating my favoured teams play style would give me some sort of satisfaction ","What's the highest quality of players epl have?in Top 50?hardly 5-6 players will come from EPL.

Good luck watching kick and rush football with tier B players.","If the EPL is great due to the quality of players, then why is La Liga considered boring to many?","&gt; then why is La Liga considered boring to many?\n\nHere on this website, people you know or who exactly?","This sub generally considers the league is too defensive","Lol what?\n\nThis sub considers La Liga to offensive \"shit La Liga defending\" was a common sentiment.","Can't share this sentiment, but i guess it has to do with the matches people watch. You're gonna see a boring game if you watch Real/Barca vs bottom 12 teams. Granada/Getafe or who else will park the bus hoping for a 0:0 draw.","Whatever works...","Teams should be playing to win not to look good losing. It's sport not dance. 1-0 wins when you've been defending all game are pretty much the best feeling you can get from football.","Yeah, and it's not like parking the bus necessarily leads to a boring game for neutrals. The second leg of the 2010 CL semi-final (Barcelona v Inter Milan) was one of my favourite games ever.","And attacking team against a parked bus is always exiting to me... it gets dull when two defensive sides meet each other though.","That's ridiculous. The best feeling? Are you freaking kidding me? I feel a lot better when my team wins 3-0.\n\nYour comment is one of the dumbest things I've ever read.","Obviously i'm not saying it's best result, but that moment when the whistle blows on a hard fought 1-0 win is hard to beat. Basically, everything feels better when you've had to work for it.","Ok fair enough.","Fuck off, if we go up this season by scoring shit goals from set-pieces, playing it long, wasting time from the tenth minute, and knocking seven bells out of the opposition, you won't hear me complaining. I couldn't give a toss about how neutrals see my club, and that applies whether we're in the Premier League or the Conference. If you offered me the choice between League One football playing football that would make Tony Pulis wince, or League Two football playing like Barcelona, I'd pick League One every time.","I agree. I couldn't give a toss about the neutrals, I just want the results by any style.

Edit: although Nolan has nothing to do with anything, you can't fire him as he's not employed. ","Nolan pushed for Snyder. He shares the blame as well.","He just wanted to make himself look better in comparison.

Though I thought he played a great batman. Also I loved the movie but I'm an unabashed fanboy. ","I really didn't get much from Wonder Woman's inclusion. She didn't add anything. Nor did I care about the character. Gal Gadot is beautiful, but her acting is bad.\n\nAs for the handling of Batman's character? Yeah, that was a major gripe for me. Batman shouldn't kill people and he was almost too bitter.

I was feral, high on several types of stimulants (modafinil, ritalin) and hypercharged. The days were sweltering hot, and I was just in transition, on Progynova and in a haze of adventurous spirit. I visit the Singularity University, Google Campus, Land's end, Chinatown, the whole lot. Then I noticed the premiere of Dredd in the cinema. So I went, late in the evening.\n\nI got kinda deep in the movie. *I forgot I was in the US during te movie*.

","Piracy is an arm's race. Developers tend to not think about things in terms of getting cracked or not but rather, how long it takes until a crack.

You faked an app and it rode on the back of Falcon Pro, totally skirting Twitter's asinine limitation.\n\nSure he works at Twitter now, but after that stunt, I'd say he has nothing to do with this. There is no conspiracy, it's just Twitter being mad about 3rd party apps (i.e. they want you to bask in their ads on the official platform).","Plenty of other apps have it (Fenix included).

He was on it all by himself, and now he's working in the US and his position at the Twitter HQ jumpstarted his career. He's meeting a lot of interesting people and can look at a bright future in the dev field. He's a nice guy and FP3 still kicks ass overall.","How does that work? ","I'm only speculating that he's actually doing it but it would work by having multiple apps listed on the Twitter developer site, where each app is given 100,000 user tokens. He then just codes it into his app that once one limit is reached it just switches to the next token.","If that kind of thing is allowed by twitter, why impose these restrictions in the first place?? ","It's not allowed.","I don't think it's allowed, but the developer probably gets away with it because he currently works for Twitter *and* also hasn't really done anything with the app aside from bug fixes in a long time.","That's against Twitter's policy. Your app will be blocked if you do stuff like that. You need to have actual separate apps to get around the token limit.","\"Fenix 2!!!\"","I am sure development will slow, and eventually stop.

It's either 100,000 tokens or 2x the active tokens if your app was around before the api change. \n\nSince Tweetbot is pretty much the only game in town on iOS I'm assuming they have a huge (but still finite) amount of tokens. ","Ohhh, i thought they circumvented the limit by just making a new app, thanks.","I think this also works. I remember one of the Klinker brothers mentioning it as a reason for why they released a new Talon version for 5.x only. Not only was it a massive overhaul of the app, but it allowed them to reset their token counter.","I know they release a new version when iOS 7  released. They do released separate versions.

Much, much, much harder to program and maintain.\n2. Can break at any time if Twitter changes their markup structure, metadata, or internal API structure or format.\n3. Slightly higher CPU usage and network load.\n4. Using the internal Twitter JavaScript API will result in relatively high memory usage (&gt;100 times more) compared to using their public external API. This is because you will essentially need to load Twitter.com with a real browser (e.g. embed Chromium) and programmatically interface with the browser. This is extremely memory heavy.\n5. If Twitter really hates you, they can easily break your product right after every update by doing intentional changes that result in the consequences of drawback \\#3. This is very unlikely to happen as it requires a lot of effort from Twitter to constantly restructure their internal APIs.\n\nAll of this has got me thinking: I should make a framework for this and make it compatible with the public external Twitter API. Clearly there is a need for this, and developers would probably pay a flat $200/mo fee for such a product if I maintained it with updates for when Twitter breaks things.","Or just make an app called Phoenix 2 with a new API key.

It's one thing to have critical mass, but with superior enough competition you can still lose that critical mass eventually and when you do there's no recovery from that. Ask Myspace, or Digg or Altavista. There's no such thing as too big to fail on the Internet. Twitter is failing to compete because they're treating their users and developers like second class citizens, it's going to catch up to them sooner or later.","The company is already falling apart. In a desperation move, they hired back the founder. Many of their best engineers have jumped ship, along with [half their execs](http://www.wired.com/2016/01/twitters-leaders-leaving/).

The fact that Dorsey has not removed this insane API user limit makes it clear they have no intentions to do what's right for the user and platform developers, which will kill them in the long run.","The Twitter stockholders demand it to have much faster growing userbase. I'm not an expert, but to me Twitter is already almost everywhere, how much more popular can you get? There is always a limit to how many users you can obtain, maybe their expectations are too high? ","Well Twitter has around 300 million users, while Facebook has 1.2 billion and YouTube has around the same. So there's definitely room for growth. The problem is Twitter is still quite a hard product for users to grasp, especially if your friends aren't active on it. ","This right here I'll never use Twitter because none of my friends use it. Why use Twitter when face book does everything twitter does plus more. Also who the fuck wants to deal with a character limit. No bueno. ","I couldn't care less if my friends are on it or not. I use it purely for news. No better way to see breaking news when you follow the right people in your field of interest. \n\nThis is something that Twitter needs to push further. ","That's actually a really good point, I get most of my news via reddit but I never considered using Twitter as a way to get the news as it unfolds. ","The problem with using Reddit for news is you can miss the news if you don't go to your subreddit or it doesn't hit the front page. With Twitter you just start off where you last left off (obviously only possible if you follow a reasonable number of people. I have 250ish and it's fine)\n\nThen it's down to you. Just follow the right websites, journalists and reporters (turn off their retweets) and you've got a fine and manageable stream. ","Huh you see the most annoying thing to me was the retweets I didn't know you could turn them off I might have to give it a second go. ","Yep. It's the first thing I do when I click to follow someone","Agreed completely. I use Twitter for one thing: chess news. Most of the top players, clubs, and organizers have active accounts, and there simply isn't a better way to see what's going on in the chess world than following the right folks on Twitter.","Care to share some of your favorite sources? ","I'm an Apple, soccer, Tottenham Hotspur and cricket fan (on Twitter) so the people I follow probably aren't going to be much use to this sub. \n\nGeneral tech wise: Joannastern, Panzer, benedictevans, charlesarthur\n\nEven those might be a bit more skewed towards Apple. I don't really have anyone from the Android scene, besides MKBHD. Anyone recommend one?","news and customer service. I'm sure it works just as well with facebook, but if I have a (possibly negative) inquiry and post it to twitter, I'll get a *lot* better results that if I'd just sent it through the contact me email page. ","Agreed. When Google Reader was killed, I used feedly for awhile. Now, I've replaced RSS with Twitter by following the websites I read.","As a man interested in tech, security, and exploit news, this.","At first I thought this, but then I realized all I wanted was a stripped down version of Facebook. I don't want the ads, the clickbait, the absurd levels of data mining, the asshole CEO, the endless shitposting from all of the \"friends\" you met once or knew years ago but don't want to offend by unfriending, the crippling battery drain from the phone app, etc. Twitter's not perfect on these points, but it's a hell of a lot better.\n\nI was forced to make an account for my freshman writing seminar (no joke - I wrote an essay about Charlie Sheen) and I've really liked it ever since. It's particularly excellent for organizing, and for following news and reactions. I really noticed this for the first time after the Boston bombings; I was able to get live information far before any news outlets and even other online news sources, which was important, especially since I go to school about 20 minutes from the bombing site and 10-15 minutes from where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was cornered in that boat. I think the character limit actually makes it even better suited to this purpose; messages get out quickly, and they're always short and to the point. No fluff, just information.\n\nAnother plus is that it really isn't a time suck. It's easy to set up notifications for the people and organizations you care about, so there's hardly any need to open the app. The character limit is great here too; the you can read the whole message from the notification shade rather than seeing an ellipsis and having to continue reading in the app. I'd guess that about 80% of my interactions with Twitter happen in my notification shade. I only open Twitter these days when I'm looking for tweets on a specific trend or event, like a soccer match or a presidential primary.\n\nFinally, the fact that few of my friends use it is actually appealing to me. Back when I had a Facebook account, the amount that people knew about my life was a bit creepy honestly. I would go out to eat with friends, for example, and would have text messages asking how it was before I had even left. Even more common was trying to tell a friend story about something cool I had done recently, only for them to tell me that they had already seen the pictures on Facebook and knew all about it. I seldom posted either, which made this all the more annoying; all it takes is one friend to post a picture of their food or something and either link me or tag me and boom, everyone else knows where I am and what I'm doing. Something like that has never happened on Twitter since I got my account, which has been really nice.\n\nTL;DR Twitter is less popular and doesn't have as many features, but that's actually a good thing.\n\nSome edits for clarity.","I actually think Twitter is a horrible medium for friend communication.      Posts go by far to fast to ever see anything from \"friends\"... it's different than a Facebook wall.  Where it *does* excel is acting as a real-life notification system... Follow local news, sports teams you care about, your local transit authority, breaking world news... pretty much anything/anyone where it would be handy/interesting to know what they are doing *right now* but it wouldn't matter if you missed something more than a half-hour old.\n\nI look at it more than any other social media but I don't ever actually communicate with friends through it.","Twitter is also great for occasional chatting with content creators - musicians, webcomic artists, game developers. Typically not the \"big ones\" because they're usually too busy to go on social media themselves, but for the smaller guys it's a great way to personally interact with your fans. \n\nOr a terrible way if you're a critic of anything, just ask TotalBiscuit.","That's not entirely true. Yes, Facebook can do  a lot that Twitter does, but Twitter is  a lot more streamlined. \n\nTwitter also has a slight learning curve so the user base isn't as horrible as Facebook. ","I'm not a heavy Twitter user personally but what I like about is that my friends aren't on it. I follow people that I think are interesting, news outlets, stuff related to my hobbies. \n\nExample. I'm a big Star Wars fan and software developer. I follow Star Wars news sources, people in the star wars community like costuming groups, podcasters, etc. I follow developers who work in the areas i'm interested in or do work in. I'm also a big fan of comedy so I follow several stand-up.\n\nTwitter, for me, is much more stuff I'm personally interested in and topical. I don't tweet much, but when I do tweet. It tends to be relevant to those interests. I'm not posting my daily schedule or what I ate for lunch. ","&gt;Well Twitter has around 300 million users, while Facebook has 1.2 billion and YouTube has around the same. So there's definitely room for growth. \n\nThat assumes that there are 900 million non-twitterers who would *want to* sign up for twitter. \n\nMost of the people I know in real life have no interest in twitter (either for tweeting or following).","That's the dilemma Twitter faces, either it makes the product more appealing or stays on this course of stagnation. ","The trouble is \"more appealing\" to a wider subset of the population means removing the things which make it different from Facebook in the first place. This alienates current users and no one will switch from Facebook to Twitter just because twitter became more like Facebook.","Right, but I don't think removing the character limit or changing the way people add/reply to each other is necessarily moving towards Facebook, it is just making the features of its product more user friendly to people that've never tweeted before. ","It also defeats the purpose of Twitter. If I had to scroll through 1000 word posts and stuff like that, I'd leave Twitter. I use it for news and updates, not stories.","I don't think they need to pull people away from Facebook. I would guess that most people who use Twitter ALSO use Facebook. So the problem is just making it more appealing to a wider demographic. ","I can't imagine what Twitter could do to make themselves appealing to me.","Pretty much this. I used to use Twitter, but eventually I realized that I was wasting my life trying to keep up with it and gave up on it. I just don't have enough time in the day to follow it, let alone contribute. ","I feel like Facebook has a more family friendly website compared to a Twitter. I don't really see families tweeting each other to stay in touch. ","That's the money people for ya. They are slaves to infinite expansion. I believe that when there are companies investing millions in super niche apps that there is gonna be a bubble bursting. \n\nSo many apps/sites that everyone knows started from dorm rooms with little money or investment. If they did it then, they think this can happen again if enough money is thrown at the devs. \n\nI believe that the only money that gets transferred between these huge sites and apps are money from big companies buying ads to investor's pockets. Only a few categories (mainly games) get money from actual users. \n\nThe users are the ones who carry money from ad people to investors so it's no wonder they demand impossibly high membership numbers. ","&gt;I'm not an expert, but to me Twitter is already almost everywhere,  \n\nAustrian here. Twitter is what? I visit it sometimes because most international companies use it(server up/down info for games), but I have not met a single person in Austria that uses Twitter. I myself only have an account because it's the fastest way to get screenshots of my ps4.  \nIn the German speaking sphere it barely exists, the tech afficionados use it, but it's nowhere near the size of Facebook here, and newsstatins only started using hashtags once Facebook made them a thing.  \nThey just never captured the market here, so I suppose there is room for growth still.   \nBut personally I wonder why it is still around. I definitely like it more than Facebook because it's simplistic, but I also get why everyone uses Facebook primarily, as it's simply a social tool and great for events and reaching people without having their phone number.","Twitter is the social media equivalent of text messaging.","I've always explained it as \"The worlds biggest IRC server.\" Once you understand it as a massive chat room (complete with # channels!), it makes a lot more sense.","It's the same for Ireland and the UK. Almost every TV show lists a hashtag at the beginning, and radio shows always want you to tweet them, but nobody in the real world uses it. People that work in media love it and they all follow and tweet at other journalists/presenters/companies but they're living in a bubble. They work hard to funnel all their fan interaction through their Twitter accounts and as a result, they end up thinking that people actually use the platform normally. For joe public, Twitter is a good avenue for when you really want to contact a specific media personality. Other than that, it's just the place you go to complain to tech companies about your devices not working properly.","The APi limit exists solely to fuck over 3rd party devs. Why? Because they want to retain control over how you use their platform. 3rd party devs can filter out ads, or rearrange your feed as they see fit, and ignore the retarded \"trending\" shit that's full of sponsored BS (seriosuly, does anyone but Buzzfeed actually look at 'trending' on Twitter, or is that just me?), all contrary to how twitter think you should use the service.\n\nThey allow third party apps though because it allows them to steal good ideas, the API limit is only there to prevent 3rd party apps that are popular to actually become a major player. Once they hit their (stupidly low) limit, they can't viably grow any more, and they remain a niche product. Twitter can then look at the app and steal any good ideas it might have.\n\nWhy does Twitter do that? Because the very nature of the medium prevents it from growing. As someone else said: twitter is already everywhere, it cannot grow its user base any more, except by heavily going for new foreign market, but those have dried up too: sure, they can chase some African and Asian countries, but the ROI to conquer those markets will be low.\n\nSo, how else increase revenue? Milk your users more. Except: twitter is so stupidly simple (from the simple types of messages you can send/recieves -tweet,retweet,reply, DM- to the messages limit of 140 characters to the simple follow/unfollow system), there simply isn't a whole lot more Twitter can actually *do* to milk its users for data. It's not Facebook, where you have pictures, pages, groups, messenger, profile pages, etcetcetc... It's just... twitter: if they start adding features, 99% of its users won't ever use them, because they have Facebook for those features.\n\nSo all twitter can do is prolong its slow death by clinging to the control they have over the apps in the most shitty way possible.\n\nPersonally though, I do actually like twitter in one way: it's *perfect* for customer service. I hate having to call, and contacting CS via email is usually painfully slow. Over twitter, somehow companies feel the pressure to answer you quickly.","Twitter is so searchable or discoverable and very public so CS pounces on complaints.  That is also what makes Twitter great for breaking news.  Setting up complex searches works great.  ","As a Hail Mary, at least Jack seems like he has more imagination than your various C-types. Seems. We'll see.","When he was brought back on he said that one of their goals was to be more friendly to third party developers. \n\nI'm not sure what or when. ","I get the sentiment and as a Fenix user I am annoyed by this, but third party apps don't help twitter. Fenix doesn't serve twitter's ads to me. I, and my app, are using twitters servers and resources and not doing anything that let's them make money to offset the cost. Third party apps are basically ad blockers at this point, I can't think of any that serve ads, it's a miracle twitter doesn't just shut them down all together.","Yes, it's like expecting the Spotify API to work with free account. You can't ensure they show your ads in third party apps. \n\nTo make it work Twitter has to find another way than ads to make money. For now it's just not possible economically to let third party apps run unlimited.\n\nThey could make the API access paying to compensate. They'd get a share of the app sells. ","Meh that's not a good excuse. Easy way to \"ensure\" they are showing your ads is by putting ads it in the api - if they don't show ads for an oauth user then limit their userbase.","This is Twitter, though. Facebook is awful yet still has a massive userbase. I doubt the entire public are going to leave Twitter any time soon.","You can have a billion users and still be falling apart because you can't make enough money out of them","It isn't about leaving, it is about failing to grow. I'm on fb and so is my 60 year old mother. Know who isn't on fb? Teens. New users/new sources of money are not there. The same can and will happen to Twitter, their actions decide how fast.","All my (teenage) friends are on Facebook… I'm pretty sure it's still growing. Only a *massive* controversy (or its closure) would get the masses away from Twitter.","This is dumb. There are so many teens on facebook. Twitter may be more popular than  fb in the US but not in the rest of the world.","facebook has successfully gained traction in large parts of the developing world, these gains are huge. In the U.S. their growth among teens is much lower than their growth among every other age group. Nobody is saying a company with 1.6B users is going to fail tomorrow, nor is anyone saying no teens are on FB. The point is their growth is slowing, and the 13-17 market is where they are going to get their new users from to sustain growth.\n\nhttp://radar.oreilly.com/2008/12/facebook-growth-regions-and-ge.html","&gt; Know who isn't on fb? Teens\n\n&gt; nor is anyone saying no teens are on FB.\n\nAnyway your source is 8 years old. [Entrepreneur recently released a study that shows 71% of teens are on Facebook](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246777)","I doubt it. Twitter is making pretty heavy losses, it needs to prioritise sellings ads to survive, not allowing lots of ad-free third-party twitter clients.","Twitter ad ROI is very low compared to FB or other ad networks. It's not usually worth spending money with them. I think that's their biggest problem.","They're actively doing things like this, is the sad thing. They shut down the TweetDeck app on Windows. They have an *incredibly* restrictive API- third party apps don't have access to group chats, or polls.\n\nAnd, from what I've heard, their official app is full of ads now, so I assume they are trying to push people to it in the long run anyway.","Twitter, like Facebook, has filled my news feeds with so many ads. I'm so done with both but unfortunately people still use both and some apps or websites still require you to sign on using the account","Can someone ELI5? I don't really use twitter and I've never heard of fenix. ","Fenix is a Twitter client. In order to use the Twitter API (to read and post tweets and so on) the dev needs to obtain a secret key from Twitter. This key is baked into the app. When a user logs in with an app for the first time, Twitter adds that app (via that key) to your account. Only 100K (iirc) people may log in with any given app; after that no new user (ie someone who has never logged in with that app) may log in with that app, unless either a) someone removed that app from their account, or b) the dev asks Twitter to get more logins for their app (which they can reject of course).","Thank you. That sure does sound like it will back some devs into a corner. It seems like either twitter has a problem with spammers masquerading as 3rd party apps or they just really don't like them.","If spammers used their own fake apps, Twitter could revoke that secret key (any tweet is associated with the app it was posted from). No, I think they want to make people use their own app, which has no limits but serves ads to users (from which Twitter gains revenue, unlike with ads in 3rd party clients).","What's stopping them from saying, \"Twitter clients that don't display our ads will have their API keys revoked\"?\n\nThey could monitor all the popular apps, and test them at random every so often to make sure they were complying.","That would kill them pretty much instantly. Some people paid good money for their Twitter clients (7 apps across 4 platforms for me); if they started displaying mandatory ads in the Twitter stream, people would get pissed. If Twitter said \"devs can pay us [amount] so they don't need to display our ads\" many devs would probably abandon their apps, pissing users off.","So what you're saying is Twitter devs and users what to have their cake and eat it too?","Right? While this token stuff is definitely the wrong way of going about it, they do have to do *something*. And I don't expect too many people are willing to pay for Twitter. Ads are really the only way to go for them.","But people buy paid apps. People would pay for twitter, Twitter never capitalized on it.","I really don't think they would. Specially considering that the age of a really big part of their usebase is pretty young. \n\nThen there's also that it wouldn't be sustainable to make it a one time buy. Server costs are an ongoing thing, if they charged, say, 99 cents once, eventually the users would still cause a net loss for them. So, it would have to be a subscription type of service. Which I believe pretty much no one would bother to subscribe to.","That wouldn't kill them lol. Most people use the official app","&gt; What's stopping them from saying, \"Twitter clients that don't display our ads will have their API keys revoked\"?\n\nNothing, and no it wouldn't \"kill them\".","At the same time, Twitter only makes money from ads. When people use third party apps, they use the product without bringing any revenue.\n\nTwitter should probably make the API access paying. ","Yeah, I think that's a fair compromise.  It's what Imgur is doing, now, but people aren't exactly happy about it.","They don't want people to use third party apps at all, they really want them to use their own app.","What's to stop the dev from masquerading as a browser and scraping/pushing the data over https rather than using their shitty api?","The API is documented, the website is not. Twitter may change the website at any point without prior notice, something it can't do with the API. Even if someone had written a parser for the website that transforms the website into a fake API, there's no guarantee whatsoever that it'll be working tomorrow, let alone five minutes from now.  \nAlso I'd almost bet a tenner that scraping contents off the website is against their T&amp;C.","&gt; Except as permitted through the Twitter Services, these Terms, or the terms provided on dev.twitter.com, you have to use the Twitter API if you want to reproduce, modify, create derivative works, distribute, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or otherwise use the Twitter Services or Content on the Twitter Services.\n\nThough you could just post .apk's manually on github or something (Because I assume the gplay store won't allow applications that bypass the twitter API). What are they going to do about it, if you act like a normal browser?","They could notice it because the browser would only ever request the site, but not the ressources like images and stylesheets. And like I said, a minor change in the structure of the website can easily throw off a parser, requiring an update of the client. What I'm also wondering about: how would you go about posting tweets? You'd have to parse the website and its scripts figure out how to emulate sending a tweet, that's another thing Twitter can easily break for you.","Yeah. The mobile version might be simpler to parse.\n\nI'm not saying it's easier than using the API, but you might just have no choice when the API is fucking awful.","or you can register your own fake app and get tokens like the old falcon pro app.","So does this mean the end of fenix? Or just new users?","I really hope this doesn't spell the end, the app will continue to function for current users but will the dev continue development without the incentive of new users?","He uses it too, so I hope not…","Note: I can't seem to find Fenix on the play store.\n","Missing for me too.

I really don't like your OFFICIAL app. The only reason I continue to use the twitter at all is programs like Fenix make it bearable. Kill this and others and guess what Twitter I won't bother to check you anymore. Which is probably why you are stuck at 300 million users and your stock price has tanked. ","You want to use Twitter in a way they can't monetize but still eats up their resources. Why should they care about you?","Because their stockholders will leave if they don't have the userbase (much less a growing userbase.) I'm not gonna use Twitter if they kill off all the actually decently implemented apps. Mind you, I've used it since 2012.","Their stockholders will also leave if Twitter continues to not make money. You and I (third party app users) contribute to twitters operating costs but provide them no monetary value. ","If their app wasn't such garbage, then I'd have no problems using it. They'd make money if they did anything actually in the interest of developers and users.\n\nAs it stands, I use a third party app because theirs is awful. Just yesterday I had to remove its notification access because I was getting tweets in my notifications -- and I looked to disable it. The only option that'd do that? Was already disabled. They can't agree on a consistent color for the navbar... something you'd see a good majority of the time you use their app.\n\ntl;dr: I'd use their app if it wasn't worse than using Falcon Pro (the original one, mind you) despite how broken it is.","I'm aware their app is terrible, that doesn't change the fact that they are bleeding money and third party apps provide no value to them. I don't like their policies either but we are frankly lucky they haven't just shut down the API all together. ","Why can't 3rd party apps make them money? How does twitter make money anyway, I'm guessing ads? Assuming it is ads, why can't they make those ads part of the feed API so that for every 5 or so tweets you get an ad, and this happens on anything using their API(their app, website, or any 3rd party)?","Twitter makes money largely on sponsored ads that are injected into your feed/timeline.\n\nThey appear as sponsored ads and you have the ability to hide the ones you don't like to twitter can tailor adds to you.\n\nHonestly Twitter is one of the few services I don't mind ads on. They aren't intrusive and take up the space of anything else. I just scroll past like any other tweet I don't like.\n\nWhy Twitter can't just serve those ads into a users API feed I don't know. I'm betting it has something to do with how they collect ad analytics on their backend, the ads are placed in the feed via a different method from just calling the general followed user feed, or some security or data constraint they are worried about exposing via the API.\n\nSomeone who has worked with the twitter API or one a system like twitter with UGC vs Sponsored content might be able to explain better why they don't just host ads into 3rd party services.","Looks like Fenix has been removed from the Play Store?","Just checked, it's removed ","Probably the dev remove it himself to not have to deal with refunds of new users not being able to login.\n\nFor people who has installed the app at least once it should be under \"My Apps\" or in their account in the purchased section.","Pick up the red telephone, MKBHD!

","The twitter app really peaked. I used to like it a lot. It was straight forward. Here is your timeline, here is your messages, notifications, profile, search, trending topics. The core of what made twitter twitter.\n\nHad some UI revisions. A few small changes in how the timeline functioned (only loading the last few hundred tweets, having to click to load more) but I was still pretty ok with that.\n\nNow it is just kinda clunky. They moved icons like favorite to weird places. Added all this moments crap which is hard to distinguish between trending topics on moments. Some other small stuff that has ticked me off but can't recall now.","What I wonder every time when I read such news: how does Tapbot handle this issue with TweetBot on iOS? Are agreements with Twitter possible?","Going by what others have said in this thread with regards to Falcon Pro, I think Tapbot release a new app by jumping from version 3 to 4, to bypass Twitters token limit. Just a theory so I could be wrong.\n\nThere are other reasons for releasing different versions - devs got to get paid for their work.","I thought Tweetbot was about before the token limit so they basically have an unlimited limit due to being grandfathered in.","If I recall, this is actually correct. I recall this being said when Falcon Pro 1 died.","Nah, all apps are subject to the tokens. ","The 100,000 user limit only applies to new apps. TweetBot is older than the limit so they get double the amount that they had at the time of the cap","Twitter isn't doing really well right now, policies like this make it worse. ","Go with Talon's route, fenix plus, he's already has the audience, just make a new app plus a new added features and keep updating the original version.","This is why I hate Twitter. Third party apps have this issue and the main app has too many advertisements and spam for me to want to use it. ","Also third party apps don't work anymore. No polls. No group chat. You only get basic functionality with third party clients forcing you to use the Twitter app.","Out of the loop: Can someone explain what Fenix is and what Twitter Tokens are?","Third party twitter clients access it via an API, but you can't just walk up to it as a random device/app and get info from it, you must identify with a token. A twitter app developer registers his app on twitter's developer site, and from then on that app's users are assigned tokens that let them access twitter via its API through that particular app. This is how twitter can say \"posted with Fenix for Android\" or whatever - it knows what tokens apply to what third party app. \n\nSicne twitter's app has room for improvement (and heavily spams the user with ads), third party twitter clients at one point more or less outweighed twitter's own app in usage. Like a spoilt child twitter decided to limit the number of tokens allocated to each app. So now if third party apps get popular enough, they reach this limit and thus can get no more users since no more tokens can be applied to them. \n\nSome apps are now getting around this by instructing the user to create their own \"app\" on twitter's developer website, then to input their token which the third party app then sends.\n\nTwitter's more recent act of revenge against third party apps is essentially putting holes in the data that it gives via its API. If you use a third party app, you will not see all of the tweets that you would on the website for example.","Thanks a bunch!","Fenix is the best Twitter Client ever.","Good to know, now that I'll never be able to use it.  :'( ","Talon is a great option too","I prefer Tweetbot on iOS, personally. I was always hoping to see an Android version, but with these token limits I'm not sure it's even worth it for TapBots to take the time to do it if they'll just be capped on Android regardless. ","They've explicitly told me that they were never going to make Tweetbot for Android. One of the main guys more or less actively despises the platform.","Thanks, MKBHD.","Praetor Fenix? *He yet lives*?!?!","The developer just might start asking the users to register an API token on the app.","Twitter still seems to not be learning not to buttfuck 3rd party developers, it seems.","Twitter wants you to use their first party app. They couldn't give any less fucks. ","This always happens to the best apps, I miss using carbon","Aww, man, I wanted to try Fenix after seeing it in Marques Brownlee's videos! Guess I'll have to stick with Plume.","Sad, but one idiot in the comments put a fisting photo...

Will be sad if development stops. ","Can someone ELI5 this token thing? ","When you create an app, specifically for Twitter, you're assigned 100,000 user tokens. What these tokens are is a key to the app, really. Much like a CD Key for a game. You can only use it once per user. When you reach the 100,000 user limit, no more 'new' users can access the app. That's more like an ELI15, but I hope that helps. ","Yes it does! And why does Twitter do this? So that no Twitter app becomes more popular than theirs? ","That's what everyone thinks anyway. I feel the same way. They saw that third-party apps were gaining popularity compared to their shitty offering and decided to limit it. ","From a business standpoint it makes sense... Yeah, it sucks for all of us, but at the same time Twitter still needs to make money. Instagram has similar rules for their API. For example you can't make another Instagram client just to try to be better than the first party one, it has to be focused on something other than content (i.e. follower counts).","That's so utterly ridiculous. ","What twitter does less is what makes it great. You go to it for humor, news, and public dialogue. That's it. No grandmas, way less advertisement (unless you follow them), no \"pages\" your stupid high school friends share, few people care if you follow them back on twitter. You can tailor it way better and easier by simply choosing what to follow without the concept of \"friends\".

I have recently found facebook emails in my spam folder which make reference to what little I had said then, and which also means they never wiped my email address from their records. Facebook is a black hole for your private data. Very powerful entities want you to feed them that. Don't. It's a bad idea.

Now we have snapchat and facebook is kinda cool again. Twitter is done. ","Snapchat is so completely different to what Twitter or fb provide I always find it hilarious when people use it as a source to prove that Twitter and fb are dead.\n\nEspecially since to almost everyone that isn't in school Snapchat is a funny gimmick toy at best you occasionally use when inspiration strikes. It's literally vine but static images that have an expiration. That doesn't make much of a dedicated social network except for the bubbly personality types who are in clique centric social circles that you usually only see in school settings.\n\n","I never understood how Snapchat became as big as it is. It was just a service to pseudo-securely send nudes. Now it's got all the Discover nonsense, and some news outlets like Al Jazeera even have their snap code as their avatar on Facebook.","You can actually send payments through it now, it's called Snapcash. Some of my friends say it's especially convenient for paying for things/substances that aren't always legal. since your comment mentioned nudes I'm sure you can guess what else people are using the payment option for. ","I worry that Snapchat is the start of me being old and not getting certain pieces of technology, haha. I'm only in my thirties but I don't quite get why it's preferable to Messenger or text messaging (aside from the vanishing pics, of course). I tried it out but found the UI crappy and nothing particularly superior to other apps. ","I'm only 20 and I find Snapchat pointless. So, don't feel bad. It's just not for you and me.","Was it ever really about sending nudes though? I mean obviously some people did that and still do but that can be said about any messaging platform or honestly the internet as a whole.\n\nThe interesting thing about Snapchat is that is allows you to share your life in a more personal, honest and less curated way. Where FB and Instagram is all about presenting the best version of your life to the world Snapchat allows you to just share without worrying about anything.\n\nThis is why it seems to really resonate with younger people because FB is where you now have all of your family and coworkers and everything is documented forever and accessible to anyone who even remotely knows you.\n\nI'm in my mid 20's and enjoy using it on a pretty casual basis with just a few select people and find the Stories feature an interesting way to share things that would be funny or interesting to people who I know well but I totally understand why it's so popular with the younger generation.","Exactly.. I'm in my late 30s. I don't know anyone my age who uses Snapchat, and if I did I would think there was something wrong with them. It's for teeny boppers only","There is a huge portion of people in their 20s using snapchat.","I use Snapchat occasionally w/ friends (I'm 24 BTW), but primarily I use it to follow marketing thought-leaders. All in their early/mid 40's &amp; 50's and I have gotten SO much useful content from them.\n\nSnapchat has more monthly active users than Twitter and simply writing off the platform which has the most of the attention of the 16-30 y/o market is pretty idiotic if you're a marketer at all. Go watch some of Gary Vaynerchuk's videos if you want to understand how important Snapchat is. It's the same \"I don't understand it so it's stupid\" argument. It's how you get old and stuck in the past.","Sure, a marketer wants to be in front of as many eyeballs as possible, and so I would expect one to endorse Snapchat\n\nI understand what it is, I just think it's a level of nonsense where I have no business or desire being","here is the thing, They never said they didn't understand it, they said it was for younger people. \nI'm 33, and I keep right up to date with tech of all types, and I understand snapchat perfectly. I have friends who are younger who use it, and a vast majority of friends closer to my own age who just don't give a shit. \n\nThe thing that is going on here, is not that people in thier 30's don't understand it, it just that typically they have moved into a phase of life where the never ending posturing, mating dance, status seeking, identity establishment and searching for what is \"cool\" that nearly EVERYONE does in their 20's is pretty much done with. Most of us are in longer term relationships or married, and are self-confident enough that we don't care nearly as much about our image as a 20 something or a teen anymore, because we have figured that stuff out (well some of us just think we have.) \nEither way, I promise, when you hit your thirties, you will care a lot less as well about keeping your peeps up to date with you latest antics, being cool and all that sort of shit. \n\nSnapchat appeals to that demographic, its hip, its happening, its cool etc, but it is like nightclubs. There is a reason why people over 30 are much much less common as its userbase. and it isn't because people over 30 don't get it. \n\nAh the arrogance of youth - you forget we already did it, you just get bored of the stuff you find exciting in your 20's eventually and move onto deeper things.","You act like you're \"all knowing\" and \"went through it\" but I run a digital marketing company so I deal with social media and online marketing for companies. You could have said the same shit about Facebook when it first came out, Instagram too. Facebook was geared toward college kids and that was the main demographic. It went through it's \"cool\" stage and then slowly got older. Now the largest demographic that uses Facebook actively is 35-65 y/o females. I'm sure you saw that coming back in the day though when Facebook was in the middle of it's life cycle..\n\nI love how many people think they \"understand\" social media when in reality they have no idea. And no, you don't \"understand it\" . Just because you think you know what it's \"about\" and aren't interested doesn't mean you \"understand it\" . It's where marketing has moved to because it's where people are now spending their attention instead of billboards and TV. In 3-5 years, snapchat is going to move up to an older demographic, mid 30's, 40's, 50's and you're going to see something else come and replace it for the younger demo. All social media goes in lifecycles if it manages to be alive long enough. Facebook and Instagram are two perfect examples of this. It has already been happening with Snapchat. Snapchat started as being a REALLY young demo, 12-17 y/o's and then social networks like \"Music.ly\" came out and that's where the younger demo flocked to while Snapchat started catching on with the early/mid 20 y/o demo.\n\nLike I said, 50% of the people I follow on Snapchat are marketing experts in their mid 40's and 50's. Look at people like DJ Khalid who gets 2+ million views per story. He's not a \"kid\". The platform is slowly moving up in demo as the older marketers jump into the platform trying to ruin it and make a buck.\n\nI don't have to convince you though. There's no reason to because you'll never believe it until it happens. I'll save it for my clients that actually have open minds when it comes to the way the world is and how things are moving.","DJ khaled is a weird example. People only follow him for memes ","You know nothing about me, and you claim with such assurance that I don't get it? And you accuse me of not getting it? You have conflated your reply audience as well with the person you initially replied to as well because you don't know how to read which username on reddit you are addressing. \nI never said snapchat was useless, that was the person who you replied to above me, you you speak to me as if I am them and have expressed their views. \n\nYou have made a whole bunch of assumptions about me just because I pointed out you lack experience of the demographic which does not care about snapchat. \n\nYour arrogance is astounding. \nI used to manage a team of thirty people directly, and I was chairing and directing digital policy meetings for a public service digital agenda for a district of about 7000 public sector employees in my home country before I moved to Tokyo. \n\nJust because you run some two bit startup making money out of the ignorance around digital channels does not make you a marketing expert, nor does it mean you do not have massive gaps in your perspective which I pointed out. \n\nI have lived and experienced the 90s dotcom bubble burst, and you are falling just as hard into some of the same over optimistic traps that speculators did when that happened. \n\nI am not saying snapchat will fail, by that. I am saying you will fail if you don't buck up your ideas because you lack empathy and adaptability and those are key qualities if you want to actually survive in your industry once your temporary tech literacy advantage is gone (and it will vanish and your under supplied skills will be devalued as people who are smarter than you compete with you.) \n\nDismiss my perspective out of your arrogance if you like. I know I talked down to you, it was deliberate because your attitude in the comment I replied to needs to be kicked up the ass. \nBut one day I promise you, you will look back on yourself aged 24 and this sort of sheer idiocy and arrogance you are displaying will make you cringe. ","I'm sorry you feel that way. No need to get hostile. Just saying you're under valuing today's biggest advertising mediums based on personal feelings. No regrets on how I act today. Quite happy with where I am in life actually. Good luck in all walks of life man, hope you can find the same happiness.","You got the reaction you got because you basically said i was closed minded, don't believe stuff that you discussed and when i talked about generational differences in perspective you replied with a bunch of marketing prediction perspectives which had no relevance to what I was actually talking about. \n\nI never actually said anything that goes against your spiel about snapchat in the slightest, and I am well aware of the things you spoke about. \nFor someone who works in marketing, you have some way to go at actually understanding what messages people are giving you, and what messages are the best ones to give out in response appropriately. \n\nWhat I wrote was designed to deflate your ego and get you to pay closer attention. If you are happy that is good, I don't dislike you and I am not trying to push you down or make you feel bad, I was trying to impart perspective to you.\n\nThe perspective that is important here: I never made any judgement call on the value of snapchat, and you totally missed that, and responded to something I didn't do. \nI provided an explanation for why different demographics value or do not value snapchat, I didn't diss it just expounded on its limitations of appeal. \n\nCalling things like \"social media lifecycles\" is far too early in the development of the internet at this point, especially with the coming advances in big data, algorithmic complexity and artificial intelligence. \n\nI have a background in Comp Sci which is what brought me into digital management, and I can assure you that you do not have the whole picture from the things you are saying, and are falling into big traps of assumption. \n\n","Just blindly ignoring a piece of technology because \"it's for kids\" is the kind of attitude that created older people today that are all \"no, no, I don't need to know about computers to do my job\".\n\n","People would say \"That Facebook thing is just for kids\" and now Facebook is set to pretty much become the entire internet for most of the world.","I'm also in my 30's and a friend and I decided to try it out one day.  We played with it for a little bit and quickly lost interest.  The UI is terrible for starters, but the whole idea around the service just doesn't make any sense for us.  I have no need for a picture that \"expires\".  If I took a picture, it's because I wanted to remember that moment.  And if I want to share it, it goes on Facebook or G+.  ","Right.. It's inherently a giddy platform, and by the time you hit your late 30s, most social giddiness has worn off. I see young 20s college students on the bus snapping themselves doing the most inane things, or just sitting in class &amp; \"checking in\" with their similarly bored/boring peers. My adolescent nieces &amp; nephew were also VERY active users\n\nIn my circles Snapchat has zero appeal, and rightly so","I don't mean to be blunt, but if you use Google +, I'd say you're probably not in Snapchat's demographic. ","Google+ lets me share photos and stuff with my family who only use email and Facebook doesn't support photospheres.","Google+ supports photospheres? Honestly.. I may use it again if so. ","Im in my late 30s and use snap chat to annoy my 13 yr old daughter. ","This is such a US-centric view,  it's hilarious. ","Did you expect a French, Syrian or perhaps Asian view from an American ? ","To be fair twitter has been very helpful guiding bombs to isis targets. ","He is speaking about the broadness of the viewpoint. As in: the rest of the world could be experiencing the opposite, so the opinion may be US-centric.","Well, 'he' went about it the wrong way . ","That is such a non-US-centric statement, it's hilarious.","Aren't all of those apps he listed avaliable pretty universally? ","But Snapchat and Facebook are much more popular in the US than they are in certain countries. For example, Snapchat doesn't exist in Japan and Twitter is something like 4x to 10x more popular than Facebook.","Snapchat does exist in Japan, but it's not very popular.  I have exactly 1 friend who has used it and he quickly abandoned it.  Then again, my friends and I aren't really the target demographic for it.  Twitter is very popular, but Facebook has been rising in popularity *very* quickly.  This is purely anecdotal, but most of the people I've met in my 10 years in Japan are much more active on Facebook than Twitter, but that wasn't always the case.  I think the switch came when better privacy controls and groups were added (they *love* the local community groups).","Almost everyone in my circle of friends exclusively uses Twitter, which has caused me to tweet almost exclusively in Japanese, confusing my 30-ish followers from back home.\n\nThe only people I know that use Snapchat in Japan are foreigners or Japanese people who have lived abroad...lol.","except.. *all of them* are from the US. this is why we aren't talking about shit like QQ and baidu.","&gt; In a desperation move, they hired back the founder.\n\nsounds... familiar.","Agree. Twitter is a Zombie company right now. It seemed great at first but their abysmal policy regarding harassment has cost them female uses it resulted in a lot of people asking why they should bother with it. For live events now we have facebook live. And facebook as a whole just delivers more. Twitter thrived briefly when it was \"cool\" but now honestly why bother tweeting at all if you are an individual? You are just shouting in the dark and allowing strangers to insult you. I give them 18 months. \n\nFacebook or Google will eventually buy them for pennies on the dollar. ","What is the policy?","\"We'll get back to you on that.\"","&gt; but their abysmal policy regarding harassment has cost them female uses \n\nIt also cost them some high profile celebrity users, such as Stephen Fry.\n","How does the token limitation help them is anyway? Even if you use the default twitter client it's still free. ","\nHeoll no,  not on Android. Android anti-piracy is a shit show. ","Denuvo is cancer. The number of games that are broken on release because of it is a travesty.","Also end consumers wanting to own their games","Or just play single player without an internet connection, in some cases.","This is surprising seeing as he kind of abandoned it. I haven't seen a decent update in months. ","I agree, I love Tweetbot on iOS. Beauty, push notifications and work like a charm.\n\nAfter try some Android clients I currently use the official app because the push notifications (battery drain in almost all clients) but I hate the UI and the irrelevants ads. Maybe the worst app for a big player in my device.","And even on iOS, I prefer Twitterific. I can get much more information on my screen than I can with Tweetbot.","I also enjoy Twitterific. I just prefer the UI in Tweetbot. I think either option is better than Fenix or Falcon on Android. Whenever I switch back to my Android phone, Twitter becomes more cumbersome. ","Agree.","If you can grab one billion users you can probably find a way to monetize that much attention but your point is true on a lesser scale.","I always pirate a game before i buy it to see if it runs before I spend my hard earned money. ","At least with Steam you can refund.","That's true but that is a process in itself that most people don't really want to deal with. They could solve this by forcing creators to make demos but I mean honestly that's tedious also. ","I prefer talon, to each his own I guess.","How often do you click on Facebook ads or promoted posts? If you're not interacting with ads, Facebook is losing more money than they're gaining on your account (wasted server time and storage space). A growing userbase doesn't magically make it more profitable.\n\nFWIW, even companies like Spotify and SoundCloud are operating at a loss. They're only around because investors believe they'll make a profit eventually, which we'll only be able to tell when they hit critical mass.","Well, Facebook isn't making money from me because I don't use it.","Metal gear solid has denuvo but it's been cracked. I'm sure it's not going to be long. It just becomes a game of cat and mouse. Create new DRM, gets cracked, repeat. The intervals of time might get larger and larger, but no encryption is uncrackable.","It will never happen. The best cracker group in the world gave up. Once you are on full encryption it is nearly impossible. They also stated the next version that comes out won't even be worth attempting. If you can't read any of the hex it is impossible to reverse engineer.","And Reason","Diablo 3 or any always online game. ","Fenix.","What do you guys use Twitter for? I made an account a long time ago but it seemed boring to me... (since I use Google+ to follow my tech channels) ","News, following people I'm a fan of.  I don't have FB.","Made an account for a raffle. Never used twitter again.","It's basically an RSS reader for me. I follow a bunch of tech and news sites and read through them when I'm on a break at work.  I don't use it to post anything myself - there's nothing the world needs to know about me.\n\nIt sounds like you use Google+ the same way I use Twitter.","Even the Play Store verification is enough to dissuade the casual pirates like me. ","Can you provide some examples? Currently doing an assessment on Android app security and the disassembly of apks.","I hate to say it but most always online systems work fairly well. ","...until your apparently offline app stops working because the wifi dropped or because your shitty server had a problem. Have fun explaining that to the customers","Yeah I didn't mean that I worked well for the customer, or even in general I only meant it stops piracy. ","Talon is near exactly like Fenix, if you'd like to give it a try.","But are the masses tweeting? or buying the products from the ads. Twitter isn't cool anymore for the same reason facebook went out of fashion. Problem is facebook has more places to grow and can pivot easily. Twitter is twitter and they can't change that. ","&gt; But are the masses tweeting?\n\nEr… yes. I'm not quite sure whether you're arguing that people are likely to move from Twitter or that Twitter will close because it isn't profitable. Like I said, the masses won't move unless it closes, and… your point seems to be that it probably will close? I'm confused as to what we're arguing about and why this is an argument.","Glad I got the app when I did. ","Enough antipiracy measures? I.e. to get 0 pirated versions?\n\nWhen it comes to a lot of media it's better to get some piracy and popularity than to have draconian measures that punishes the paying customer.","As much as I hate Twitter's dev policy (I mean, I had the original Carbon on webOS and frickin' *loved* it), the first-party client is, imo, the best option. Part of that is due to Twitter's own restrictions, but their interface is actually really nice. Especially with the new material UI.\n\nEdit: ~~hey, downvoting for an opinion. fun!~~","I hate having to constantly scroll and tap to load more tweets just to see all I missed.  Why can't they just load all of the damn tweets I missed?","That's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. If they prefetched all the tweets, then people complain about data usage.

","I've never been into Twitter, but it really boggles my mind that people buy Twitter apps that is guaranteed to last just a finite time. \n\nCan someone help explain it?

Once you begin impeding the legit person's experience, you've added too much. ","Whats fenix?","Copied this from another comment thread:\n\n&gt;Fenix is a Twitter client. In order to use the Twitter API (to read and post tweets and so on) the dev needs to obtain a secret key from Twitter. This key is baked into the app. When a user logs in with an app for the first time, Twitter adds that app (via that key) to your account. Only 100K (iirc) people may log in with any given app; after that no new user (ie someone who has never logged in with that app) may log in with that app, unless either a) someone removed that app from their account, or b) the dev asks Twitter to get more logins for their app (which they can reject of course).","This is 100% correct. I'm 15 and there are only a few kids at my school that use Facebook. Everyone has moved on to instagram, snapchat, and twitter.","Instagram is owned by Facebook, keep that in mind.

It's amazing how antagonistic they are towards people who want to build on their product.","I think it would be reasonable for them to charge for API usage in different tiers, and then it would be a business expense for Twitter app developers where they could still profit from ads and payed versions of the app. Maybe after 100k they start charging, assuming you should be making money from the app by now.","Is piracy a big thing on Android?\n\nI've never bought an app (or pirated one, ether, in case that's unclear), but I tend to think of them as costing $1 or £2 - hardly worth stealing.\n\nI know there are some games which are $5 - $10, but still.","Piracy is a huge problem for Android devs http://www.ibtimes.com/androids-piracy-problem-forcing-developers-give-away-games-altos-adventure-latest-2303552","No, silly, it's called Fenix","NOOOOOOO!!!!","So what happens now, would the dev now have to develop a new twitter client, will this client be abandoned.","I think they can come out with a new version and it starts over. You'd have to re-buy it though. If I recall this is how Tweetbot works ","So Twitter should just let other companies make money off of them for free? ","Same for any company, but it's like movie companies wanting a shangri-la of no pirating.  It's just never going to happen...and you would think the bright people at Twitter would accept that.","It's harder (maybe impossible) for movies, but in the PC gaming scene, recent versions of Denuvo have been 100% effective in preventing piracy for any devs/publishers that can afford it.","They wouldn't notice. If you program an app to scrape the website from the app you're already in a losing battle. If they change the API slightly, you'd need to push an entirely new app, which for Apple takes over a week. \n\nAnyone who does this would have their own server that they control, and the app would make standard requests to and from their own server, which is then responsible for scraping/whatever Twitter. If they make a change, you update your server in one place and all your apps start working again. Gplay won't know what you're doing behind the scenes. \n\nThat said, it definitely violates their ToS so I don't see anyone getting traction doing this in the first place. Any app that gets the attention of Twitter will immediately be sued and that dev will lose, hands down. ","Why the fuck would they do this?","What is stopping people from decompiling the official app and mimicking it's behavior to access these private APIs?","So if I download Fenix again and try to sign in, will I be denied? Or is this just for people logging in for the first time?","Just for new purchases.  If you bought it before, you still have a token.","Did they change that to only new users? I thought tokens were logins in general. Only because I used another 3rd party app for around 5 months, then all of a sudden could no longer use the app because I was getting an error saying they had no more tokens. \n\nIt worked out for twitter I have stopped suing 3rd party apps, because they can't be relied on to work since twitter puts on a token limit.","Eh, call it \"limited edition.\"","SAME!!","That's... Probably not true","You think twitter would be here with out the third party apps? No, it's totally true","I know the argument is that mainstream users don't care about the third-party apps, but it would never have reached the point of mainstream users if they had not existed.","Know any mainstream users that still use sms to update their feeds? I don't know any. Haven't in years. ","Twitter's popularity and status comes from its use by celebrities and world known figures, not third party apps","It wasn't celebrities and world known figures that got twitter into the mainstream. It was the 3rd party developers that took it from something a handful of people used to tell their little part of the world something that was on their mind. Third party developers made it into something that allowed people to actually read what other people had to say and join in on conversations. Before third party apps you couldn't even post a photo to twitter. You had to use sites like TwitPic, location...ha you had tools like Google's latitude and that one iOS app that would link geolocation (Sorry, I forget it's name).\n\nCould you imagine actually trying to do that stuff without 3rd party apps? Don't forget twitter is/was based on SMS and didn't have their own 1st party app until they purchased the iOS app tweetie in april of 2010 and tweetdeck in may of 2011. a full 4-5 years after they opened shop in July of 2006. During that time it was the 3rd party apps that made twitter usable.\n\nSo no. It wasn't celebrities and world known figures that got it into mainstream. It was third party developers. The celebrities and world knowns only joined once they realized there was this huge platform of people tweeting photos of their dinner using TwitPic that they could reach out to.","What are you talking about? There's a first part application that the vast majority of users use. Twitter would still be huge without third party apps.","there is NOW, the first 4-5 years there was SMS and the webapp. The real use came from mobile apps and desktop apps like TweetDeck. And the first party apps were 3rd party apps that Twitter bought up.","So can't Fenix acquire (buy?) more tokens from Twitter to support their growth? ","They can ask them for more (no idea if that costs something) but Twitter has rejected some of these requests in the past for mundane reasons (one popular client was deemed too similar to their own app or some bullshit reason).","Yikes.. I'm sure that discourages a lot of devs from investing time in twitter apps ","Shit... Yesterday I literally was just telling people in this sub to try Fenix.... :(","yeah.....Nah.","Found the fellow kiwi... ;)","Oh, hello tasmania 2.0 resident :)","I just wants to throw it out there that like Facebook and Reddit (to differing degrees) Twitter inserts its left wing political views onto its platform, sometimes covertly, making it far from an impartial news and information site. Its a propaganda network masquerading as a communication platform. \n\nSo their control freak policies contributing to their decline is good news to me. Maybe the next incarnation of micro blogging or whatever the hell it is, will be more free and open.","Can you give an example of how they do this?","They delete rising hashtags that are popular and right wing oriented, such as anti Hillary Clinton hashtags, just after a debate.

Its Twitter, the company, quietly suppressing or elevating trending topics, as a company, not the users. That's my whole point. It has become a partisan propaganda Outlet, and that's a shame. Itcoukd have been independent and impartial, then it would be a useful tool.","The tin foil hat must've been wrapped a bit too tightly when you dreamt this up. Twitter is used by lefties and righties alike with plenty of success on both sides. It's also a social network, not a \"news and information site.\" Whatever you are seeing on Twitter is what you want to see, whether you are actively following or not. I imagine that any time you might actually spend on Twitter is spent seeking out these lefties that you fear so you can disparage their opinions, and Twitter likely curates your content towards that. If you're only following users like Fox News, Ann Coulter, Hannity, etc., that's basically all you'll see. If anything, the argument could be made that it's a propaganda site for all types of propaganda, but it certainly doesn't skew one way or the other. You could, of course, just be upset about what's popular on Twitter, but that would be an issue with the users and not the network itself. ","Nope. Twitter has been,caught deleting accounts and eliminating the rise of hashtags that are unflattering to Hillary Clinton. Twitters CEO throws fundraising parties for her. They are also more willing to give 'verified' account status to those on the left and have punished political writers on the right for tweets that Twitter opposes, by taking already issued verified status' away! \n\nSo its exactly what I said and the opposite of what you said. Its not an open or fair platform. When I point out twitters manipulation of user opinions, you will fall back to saying its a social media site not a news site, but the corruption and manipulation is still there regardless. Its manipulating opinions of the users based on the owners political views.","Your paranoia is laughable. Is Twitter's CEO not allowed to have political views? Which accounts have they deleted that were completely within their stated guidelines? Why don't conservatives leave the platform if it is so incredibly unfair to them? Your comment about their willingness to give verified accounts to certain users is completely made up with zero basis in reality. Twitter doesn't flood you with random opinions. They flood you with ads. You see what you want to see on Twitter as far as users' political views go. \n\nThe only information I could fine to support your accusations was from incredibly, overtly biased right wing sites. Here is an example that I'm sure you've already read: http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/02/17/conservative-twitter-users-must-fight-back/\n\nIn that \"article\" the blogger claims that \"inside sources\" confirmed what you've claimed, but they give no evidence whatsoever. The entire piece is really quite a joke with no supporting evidence other than Jack Dorsey had blue hair once and went to Ferguson (oh, the horror!). Perhaps you should take a moment to consider the world in a different light. Things aren't black and white. Liberal vs. conservative isn't good vs. evil. The entirety of the mainstream isn't out to get you, and they certainly aren't out to brainwash everyone. I find it troubling that you needed to mention Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Have you also taken note of SnapChat's insane left-leaning ways? What about Instagram? I'm sure it's only a matter of time. Or maybe it's worth considering that the majority of users on these sites are young people, and the majority of young people are socially, liberally-minded. Give them time to grow up and hate/fear the rest of the world as much as you do. ","In case you are curious about the verified checkmark thing, he is referring to the \"journalist\" milo yiannopoulos, who got his verified mark revoked after he broke twitters user policy (unsurprisingly, he works for the same super biased conservative site you already linked, lmao)","That's pretty much what I expected. Thanks. Lol. ","Twitters CEO is allowed to,have political views. Has allowed to manipulate public opinion on the platform. Im also allowed to think its a damn shame that Twitter could have been a useful, free place to share ideas and information. \n\nAnd I didn't make anything up, so I don't know where your getting \"paranoid\" from. Im just deriving the obvious opinion after reading about twitters behavior. \n\nYour arguing as if Twitter us the free and open platform that it appears to be. Im,telling you its not. And your one google away from knowing that. \n\nOh and hate and fear? Sure. Anti Hillary Clinton trending topics get deleted because Im a redneck filled with hate and fear. Sure. \n\nPolitical manipulation on Reddit and Facebook are well documented. Facebook considered manipulating fees to oppose Donald trump just last week. Your troubled for the wrong reason. \n\nAnd its silly that your complaining that sites are biased. First, the information on them is true or false. Pretty simple. Second. My,while point is that Twitter is biased, but covertly. You can see breibart as biased but refuse to believe Twitter can be too? \n\nPerhaps you should see the world in a different light. Its not all black and white. See, that was easy to say.","You've provided no evidence to support your claims, yet you spend all this time regurgitating the same stuff over and over. Twitter isn't \"free and open\"? That's weird. I seem to be able to find all sorts of information from differently thinking individuals with almost no effort at all. Please provide me with some evidence that isn't tied to a right-wing biased outlet, OR provide some evidence that isn't just from \"sources\". Lol. \n\nI'm guessing you meant to say \"feeds\" instead of \"fees\", but a poll passed around by Facebook employees is hardly worthy of the fear-mongering that you've clearly fallen victim to or the fear you're trying to peddle yourself. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's apparent that you are a very close-minded, fearful individual and I'm not going to be able to open your eyes via Reddit. My suggestion is that you simply stop using those platforms and tell all of your like-minded friends to do the same. I would be so happy if you could convince Ann Coulter to stop tweeting. Don't get your panties in a bunch, though. I was just joking. I'm not trying to silence one side of the political spectrum. \n\nFor funsies, here's a link to the list of the most influential politician journalists on Twitter and it's riddled with lefties and righties alike.

I swore off anything made by that dev after he pulled the bait-and-switch.","Welcome to reddit! /s","Then they need to find a way to make money in third party apps. I don't know how Twitter normally makes money(haven't been on in about 3 years), but I'm guessing ads. Put the ads or whatever they do to make money into the feed by definition, or at least in some way where it's not dependent on using their app to get money. If the API to get tweets automatically pulls an ad for every 5 tweets or whatever, then any app, theirs or falcon or whatever, they all make them money. \n\nIf that's not how this works or there's a reason that wouldn't work, please let me know. ","Can I get a EIL5?","&gt; Fenix is a Twitter client. In order to use the Twitter API (to read and post tweets and so on) the dev needs to obtain a secret key from Twitter. This key is baked into the app. When a user logs in with an app for the first time, Twitter adds that app (via that key) to your account. Only 100K (iirc) people may log in with any given app; after that no new user (ie someone who has never logged in with that app) may log in with that app, unless either a) someone removed that app from their account, or b) the dev asks Twitter to get more logins for their app (which they can reject of course).","Ty\n","&gt; You faked an app and it rode on the back of Falcon Pro, totally skirting Twitter's asinine limitation.\n\nI suppose this is what you have to do when you're essentially only making money off of others work.  Just like they say with the cloud, you don't own it so don't rely on it.","That's not luck. It's just not an option for them at this point; a good portion of users will stop using Twitter (again, myself included. I know several people who would do the same) if they kill off the API. \n\nThey'll continue to bleed money, unless they treat developers better, and say, offer to remove the token limit + small revenue, like Youtube ads, for promoted tweets being in their apps every, say, 500 tweets. Will that be a turnoff for some people? Yes. Would it help solve their bleeding money *AND* users problem? Also yes. There are solutions to their problems, they're just not willing to do them because they lose something; I am not saying my solution is a good one, but there are solutions.","What will happen now?

Did the author rerelease the app with a new package name and new Twitter API key, then just proceed to update both from the same codebase while directing new users to only use the new version?","I think he's just operating multiple API keys in one app. The old Falcon Pro was unlisted but those that bought it can still download it.","Does falcon pro make you pay for each Twitter account? Holy shit.","I think you pay for the first one and then if you want to use more than one account a second purchase unlocks that. You wouldn't have to pay for the third account.","Because even if they don't make money of a third party user directly, they profit from having a high user base (because of the profitable customers a large community attracts). Losing users costs them one way or another.","That's only if the net gain from those additional profitable users offsets the number of unprofitable.

The notification icon also lost its distinction from other notifications, but that's not too important.\n\nMy biggest gripe, is that it doesn't make sense in terms of Material design.

When looking over a grid or list of icons, I'd remember that music is orange before even considering what's inside the generic google play triangle.","Personal taste, some times you can't explain why you don't like something.

Faker only went back after he was ignited because it was sure that he would die anyway, so he returned to maybe do some dmg before he dies","I don't know why you are questioning me, I was just explaining what happened \n\n\nThat said \n\n\nI don't play mid, but to me watching it in real time looked to me like faker cleansed too early, before the ult and to my eye why he lost the fight so bad, but again I'm not really trying to be an expert here, which is why I only mentioned that \n\n\n\nFaker also came back into the fight with like sub 5% hp, he was entirely safe and came back to get more poke which gorilla ignited and killed him for\n\n\nYou really need to re-watch that fight and tell me with a straight face that faker didn't walk back from safety into a fight with extremely low HP just to die \n\n\nAnd again I never commented on either of these things because I do not claim to be an expert on league of legends. But to say everything was perfect that fight is very misleading imo ","what lurkedlongtime is referring to is that before Gorilla was even remotely close to being in range, faker was WAY out and came back in. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1RuYar8nk&amp;t=25m05s\n\nfeel free to watch for yourself. jerk\n\nedit: here have a downvote -_-","Yeah. I dunno what game they were watching\n\nGorilla hit the ignite, so Faker just turned back in to do as much damage before he died","Faker also came back into the fight before the ignite, before that he was nearly under his tier two tower before coming back in ","What? Faker 're-engaging' was him safely poking a Nautical from under his tower. Gorilla flash, head butted from fog and landed the ignite. Faker didn't know he was there and was well away from anything except an offscreen Alistair ","Everyone is totally blind here,  GorillA w'd one of them(dunno wich top or jgl) to get closer in range to faker then flash ignited to him - tanked 1-2 turret shots then ali ult.  It was a play by gorillA,  no clownfiesta or missplay.  Faker didnt expected a heavy diving support who blows 2 summoner and a ult for the kill.  He expected clearly that GorillA gonna peel for the others. ","&gt; It was a play by gorillA, no clownfiesta or missplay. \n\nWell lets take an objective look at what happened throughout the extended [fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1RuYar8nk&amp;t=25m05s).  \n[25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1RuYar8nk&amp;t=25m22s) Faker is ignited by Gorilla after they already got the Liss kill, presumably to \"save\" Blank (He could have easily been out of range of Gorilla's flash W ignite range otherwise). Unfortunately, Blank was never in any danger in the first place having more than enough health + flash and the fact that the opponents were Naut and Alistar who don't do enough damage to kill him. Clear misplay giving up a kill for free.\n  \n[25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1RuYar8nk&amp;t=25m32s) Smeb goes back in to the fight for no reason at all. At this point, he has already used his ult, Gorilla is guaranteed dead and he has a pretty low chance of even killing Blank. We see later on at 25:38 once he realizes this and wastes his flash running away from the fight he stupidly walked into.\n\n[25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1RuYar8nk&amp;t=25m38s) Peanut Qs into the SKT team despite the SKT frontline having full health and having almost no chance at getting any kills at all (SKT could easily back off to the turret if they didn't want to fight and Smeb already flashed out)\n\n[25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB1RuYar8nk&amp;t=25m42s) Blank randomly decides to jump in while having 10% Hp. The fight was already 100% won at this point as ezreal had arrived so what he did here was pretty bizarre. If he had flashed immediately after the Q he might have lived but because he got greedy he essentially gave smeb a free kill.\n  \nThe rest of the fight was essentially Wolf outplaying ROX in the teamfight with exhaust onto Pray + Tahm Kench countering Kindred ult. I'm not going to undermine Wolf's spectacular support play here but lets look at what ROX opted into. They already traded 2 for 1 at the start of the fight with their only kill going to their support. Not worth, but at least it was the enemy jungler that got the kill (Faker got no assist). They then opted in to a 3v4, blowing all their ults and summoners to get a single kill on Blank (who pretty much suicided) and feed a double kill to Bang's Ezreal.\n\nSo i don't know what match you were watching but if you think there was no missplay or that this wasn't a clown fiesta then how do you justify all the points i mentioned above? SKT played decent for the most part but ROX pretty much fed SKT all those kills.  Whenever NA/EU makes a series of bad plays it's considered a Clown Fiesta but when Korea does it, they're somehow excused? Real sad how people on this sub can't judge plays for themselves and have to resort to sucking korean dick in order to decide between good or bad league of legends.\n\n","I was talking about the GorillA ignite kill on fakers velkoz and you start yelling about the fucking full game and sucking korean dicks,  swallow your shit and callm down lol","Comparing two Regions where one values more things in life over a game and the other having more people who eat, breathe and sleep LoL on a daily basis...Rather unfair","Oh pls tell me!

Are you implying that AHQ and FW were both better than FNC who finished fist in their group and made it to semis after sweeping best chinese team ? lol","mhmm what? both origen and fnc outperformed flash wolves BADLY","you deluded, get medication.","the actual result from worlds was fnc=og&gt;ahw=fw if thats what you were trying to say.","Shitpost comment section as usual.","Yeah they really improved or adapted better to the less snowbally meta after 2014.","Faker walked bag in because he got flash ignited.","There are 2 different things at play here. Just watch the fight i cant link on mobile.\n\n\nI am not referring to the fact that he went in AFTER he got ignited.\n\n\nI am talking about the fact that after he was nearly solo killed he ran to his tier two tower and could have recalled there. He was perfectly safe to do so. He was already there. When I say he went back in to suicide and die. Im talking about the fact he was in a spot that was 100% safe with his 20 hp, but he instead walked all the way back into the fight, and gorilla killed him with a flash ignite. \n\n\nSo many people are missing that part that he reentered the fight with 20 hp, thinking that im referring to what happened after the ignite.","Its funny, i just watched it but now i have to rewatch. I do recall being flabbergasted when he went back in.","Ia have to say that both teams (SKT and ROX) didn't look that strong in the playoffs as they did during the WCS.\n\nBUT at the same time NA playoffs were way, way below that. Especially the TSM vs CLG series was a \"who can throw better\" contest. Both teams looked so broken. If IMT woulnd't have played that crappy style vs TSM they would have probably swept the finals and even they wouldn't look more than ok against koreans.\n\nEven EU is a bit weaker than in the summer split.","Really? Imo, EU in the summer split was really competitive, quite some strong teams in there.","OG and FNC were both weaker than last split. The top tier got wider but not better. Even G2 is not as strong as FNC or OG last split but close.","I'd argue G2 are as strong as last season OG, but not as strong as FNC. Looking at SKT though, they don't look as strong as when they had Marin shot calling.","I think spring G2 &gt; spring FNC but they definitely can't match summer FNC. ","hurd dat","yeah I agree, but then again, who knows how good a team can be? I think no one expected them to be this strong in summer, they can only get better I suppose!","Oh yeah there is a ton of potential growth in G2 but summer FNC looked like the strongest team the west ever produced.","That's because FNC were the strongest team the west has ever produced :D","Why does everyone think Marin is the shotcaller? He isn't they are all talking at the same time ","not sure I would agree completely as at worlds OG looked slightly stronger then FNC , so I would say current G2 is the same as last season OG and FNC","There's no way OG looked stronger than FNC lol, there is a reason that FNC team were the strongest team the west has ever provided.","well we cant really compare now logically both lost 0-3 at worlds semifinals , OG against SKT and FNC against KOO ,  FNC were the best team in the west , though I would say only In regular season , OG stepped up a lot at worlds .","&gt;Ia have to say that both teams (SKT and ROX) didn't look that strong in the playoffs as they did during the WCS.\n\n Why you say that, because they had some ''misplays'' lol\n\n LoL is a game of reactions, you can only make 100% perfect games if your opponent is inferior or if you totally dominated the early game. When the 2 best teams in the world are playing, there will obviously be moves that will SEEM like mistakes because the other team reacted extremely well or made plays to take a lead\n\n Cloudtemplar said that this was the highest level of OGN finals ever, and its hard to argue with that. All games were extremely close and won or lost by one crucial teamfight at 45 min\n\n","Especially because they had a lot of misplays and especially SKT on their way up had some games that were really not good. Against KT they made mistakes they wouldn't have done some months ago which made some games closer than they should have been.\n\nMaybe they can still play at the same lvl as they did at the WCS if they need to but with their playoff performance both teams look slightly weaker.","That must have something to do with KT being a worse team than ROX. Which leads to what the above guy is saying, LoL is a game of reactions. If you dont think that the 2 best teams in the world are playing at the highest level, then i dunno what you qualify as highest level","The thing is that both teams played better the last time they played each other (worlds). SKT with Marin was stronger.","They weren't though? Fnatic finished above Ahq and reached the semis.\n\nOG beat fw 3-1. Not sure how it can even be argued","well can't deny lms is the third strongest after korea/euw. chinese and na are pretty much the same.","OG and FNC got the absolute best draws possible for quarters imo. The FW-OG series was close. I still think ahq would have beaten fnatic not because they're a better team but because its a strange mismatch the ahq always seemed to either win or take a hefty lead in.","That's your opiniom and it still wouldn't mean that AHQ are a better team than Fnatic. Stylistic mismatches happen.\n\nLOL you say OG got the easiest draw possible but they drew an LMS team 😂 OG ran FW around the map and had priority in most of the series.","They weren't on paper but the games were close :)\nThey definetly had a better showing than NA or china","So they weren't as good as EU then? Which isn't what you said before.","The one game that decided the first place in group B between AHQ and FNC was a really long clown fiesta, that both teams could have won. Because AHQ narrowly lost, they got second and SKT in quarters. OG was better than FW, but AHQ was pretty much as good as FNC at worlds.","&gt; Because AHQ narrowly lost\n\nBecause they narrowly lost, it doesn't count. Let's forget that the first game between them Fnatic completely threw away too.\n\nFnatic won more games than AHQ in groups and therefore didn't face SKT. They fucking EDG and reached the semifinals.\nAHQ got swept in the quarters.\n\nHow disingenuous do you have to be to even argue this? LMS were barely even better than China at Worlds since IG beating AHQ another time would have meant two CN teams in quarters. Oh wait, that's completely moronic logic.\n","You see, if it was the other way around, that FW beat OG 3-1 and AHQ got to semis by beating FNC in the second game, nobody would have seriously suggest that EU was actually better than LMS when they would have gotten DIRECTLY beaten. There is some weird bias against EU in cases like this, not sure where it's coming from.","It's honestly so weird.","Why is everyone on Reddit mad, when you try to make an argument, that doesn't completely agree with them? wth? AHQ and FNC had two close games, where each of them won one. Had AHQ won the second game it is not exactly farfetched to assume that they also could have beaten EDG. All I am arguing is that those two teams were really close in skill at worlds. I never said anything about LMS being as good as EU at worlds. I literally said \"OG was better than FW\". For some reason, you and /u/Azashiro seem to think that I am anti EU. I'm not. I have always cheered on EU at international events and all I am saying is that AHQ was a fucking good team at worlds, at least comparable to FNC. And I said that, because LMS HAS been underestimated almost every time. ","Sure, in the past LMS, mainly in S5 LMS was majorly underestimated at MSI and Worlds by most people. This year however LMS is being overrated by people that don't watch LMS so they give way too much of a benefit of a doubt and elevate LMS's level to unreasonable proportions. It's NA that often gets overrated, at MSI last year, at worlds last year, NA this regualr season, at worlds S3, S1 and S2 etc the list goes on with NA getting overrated.  EU usually gets slightly underrated, at S3 and S1 worlds especially, at MSI EU got massively underrated due to Monte's \"shit show\" comment. I still remember how before S5 worlds people were saying how CLG could give FNC a fight, and they could beat OG and definitely H2K. Mean while OG and FNC showed themselves to be multiple levels ahead of CLG that had only one strategy, CLG was around H2K's level, but almost all of the NA fan comments in Reddit denied that coming into worlds. People have this idea stuck in their head that EU and NA must be close in strength, that EU can't have all of the top 3 teams in the west at any given time. \n\nEven now people are implying that LMS has gone past EU, China has caught up to EU for no good reason, only explanation is that \"oh you don't think teams can improve\" when the point about FNC beating the 2 best CN's teams and CLG in Bo3's. OH and NA is soon to be equal to EU. With no basis. ","That will probably never change though. I have no idea about LMS now, as I haven't watched any of it. China is a region I won't even really try to evaluate. If they suck as much as their last few showings, I won't be surprised, but I also won't be surprised if they suddenly show up huge. MSI last year was because of TSM's strong showing before and after S4 worlds and IEM it was reasonable to assume, that EU wouldn't be too strong. It seems like analysts over all seem to have a hard time evaluating how strong a region is, without having them play other regions (see China S5)","S4 EU was at it's weakest sure, players like Mithy, Zorozero, Nukeduck, Freeze, Forgiven, Odoamne, Febiven, Kasing, Ruy, Cabochard, PowerOfEvil, Huni, RO, etc weren't in the pro scene at their current form at the time. Meanwhile Bjergsen went to TSM and LMQ came to NA. NA got artificially stronger by taking strength away from EU and China. But even then, EU and NA went 3-3 at worlds, splitting the games, and that was with SK not having their best player for the first game against TSM. So even then NA wasn't that much ahead, also NA lost their 3rd best team completely in LMQ where as EU got a new 3rd best team out of nowhere in H2K. Also NA had 2 good teams, TSM and C9 at the time, but with C9 getting weaker and weaker with time.\n\nMeanwhile EU had 4 good teams that were close in strength, FNC, UOL, SK and H2K. Those teams had diversity in play style, the pace they put, the champions they innovated and mastered. EU had aggressive ultra early game teams that they lacked in S4 and S3, NA didn't have any quality aggression, China, EU and LMS did. I thought FNC would crush TSM's out of date passive style. It annoyed me that Montecristo and the community shat on EU and couldn't see what I saw. But we know how that story ended. EU exceeding everyone's expectations and NA showing their true selves. \n\nIt's always easier to look clean in the \"macro\" game, objective control and your rotations when the game is slow paced, teams like Spring FNC slaughtered teams that couldn't keep up. However when two speed demons fight it looks \"messy\", see FNC vs UoL but when 2 slow paced teams play it's easier to make the \"correct\" and clean calls since you have so much dead space between each move that threatens you see C9 vs TSM. Prolly put it well, G2 kills teams with overwhelming speed that they react and rotate as a unit, their plays are extremely relentless and fast which is how they out play teams.","Haha keep dreaming hotshot","Are you serious?\n\nAphro is easily on par with Hai and both are lightyears ahead of everyone else.\n\nHai because of his shotcalling, Aphro because of his shotcalling AND massive lane dominance.","Hai's shotcalling doesn't make him a good support, in fact he's been pretty mediocre at performing the role.

If you're talking about Dota 2, I want whatever it is you're on.","in a sense both is true, dota 1's popularity was an attempt to transfer over to Dota 2, but by then much of the fanbase was transferred over to league, statement still stands as like Dota 1 in no way is relevant now as Dota 2 is the new model but Dota 2 fanbase is nothing compared to what we call the big 3\n\nits like if we look at the world we know in WWI it was Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, no one really cared about the French Prime Miniter","I mean, I don't know how you have CSGO there then, considering Dota 2 is bigger than CSGO? ","Hm is it though, i think csgo is there as the name is bigger in the fps world. The reason dota 2 isnt there is because much off its popularity is consumed by the popularity of league\n\nAnd i also think its based on popularity in terms in location. Csgo in terms of the west has a much larger fanbase than dota2 however when taken into world perspective csgo is not as prominent\n\nBut in the context of the world league is even larger and thus dota 2, other than by their loyal fanbase is often ignores\n\nCsgo however is the #1 fps which the western world is growing into, Asian countries have yet to accept the fps culture as a whole and thus its not a world game but for the genre it has topped the charts in terms of competitions","Not necessarily, just by the numbers, Dota 2 is definitely a good chunk bigger than CS:GO. Your point about the differences in genres is valid though, but I think if anything, League is the game that's going to stagnate first, because it's already so big. Dota's still got a lot of room to grow. I mean just look at the competitive scenes; not to rag on League, but there's really no competition. It's always Korea every year.

By your logic i can say ''If they were top 4 they would made semis so they are clearly not top 4'' -- which is what i dont think but this applies to your logic.\n\nWhat? No. I'm not talking about standings, I'm talking about what actually happened. If FNC was top 2, they would have been able to beat any team that was not top 1. Them losing to KOO shows you that they are at MOST top 3, and considering their group stage, KT, and AHQ, that's a pretty damn big stretch right there. Esp since KT gave KOO 4 competitive games, no stomps, while KOO completely wrecked FNC in pretty much every game. \n\nSomeone who is top 3 is someone who can beat anyone who isn't #1 or #2. So KT couldn't beat KOO, therefore the logic holds up. ","Actually Na did better in S5 worlds than what they did in S2 worlds. (doesnt mean much but it was not their worst season ever)","impossible to call them top 2, KT was better than either EU team.

The thing is, SKT was just too far ahead of the rest.","Koo and OG close?

Well of course I want every region to get better since that would really help with quality but that has nothing to do with pride.

Being so close minded, thinking so small that it's not just something that commonly happens but the way things should be. In a time when the Internet opens up the ability to watch and communicate despite language and distance and not understanding the point of liking something other than the town band.

Again this is close minded, I assure you the reasons people enjoy C9/Fnatic (like in your example) are not distance limited. I can be happy for SKT same way people happy TSM people just form connections but like I said it's bizarre to me observing how integral \"same as me\" thinking is in that process for most people. Like here in not seeing how you can have the same reaction for SKT as Fnatic is based on \"but they're different\". ","You know your comment said between the lines that you rate your nationalism higher than the sport it self right?","You can enjoy watching two good teams play that are not from your region, but why would you support either of them, especially when there's no underdog story or something like that?","I do nothing else in every sport. There is only 1 things I root for and that is Germany going out as early as possible in every soccer WM/EM because all these people that know nothing about the game talk about it like it would be there passion.

As for Sneaky, yes absolutely I would pit him as the best western individual performer during 2014, just because you say he isn't does that mean he isn't? Do you see how arguing points like that is literally useless? Anyway, the only person in contention of this is Froggen but his team failed to make it far during international competitions. Sneaky managed to look extremely good against some of the best players in the World, like Deft, while absolutely outclassing other western ADCs like Rekkles, Tabzz, Vardags.\n\n2. Recent history is also 2014, that doesn't exclude 2015 from being recent history. I acknowledge the success of EU in 2015, and never did I try to discredit it. Do you see how nitpicking and strawmaning isn't really effective here? And for All-Stars 2014, it is 100% relevant. It's is LITERALLY the same fucking tournament as MSI but with a different name. C9 played the tournament with a sub mid laner, Link, because their shotcaller had a collapsed lung. Yet they still managed to have a good showing at the tournament, receiving 2nd in the group stage. And we have seen what C9 looks without Hai. However Fnatic got embarrassed at the tournament losing to NA,CN, and KR. Only scraping by a win against last place TPA, and then losing to SKT when they played their entire S3 skin comp and still managed to win. I don't know where you derived that no one talks about. http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/All-Star_Paris_2014\n\n3. You're again strawmaning and arguing something I am not opposing. I fully acknowledge this, yet my point has not been addressed at all.\n\n4. This is more strawmaning and is useless to the discussion. I know you don't think by \"embarassing things\" that I meant that very same scenario at every Worlds every year. I fully acknowledge these placings, but embarrassing things DO happen all the time for these regions, and there are countless examples.\n\nYou know I am not delusional nor that I have selective memory, saying these things won't change how weak the alleged facts were. I acknowledge historically EU has been better than NA. But this level of disrespect towards everyone but Korea is unwarranted. Especially against China who also have been historically better than EU. You claim that saying NA and EU are not close and saying so is NA/Reddit logic but have you actually analyzed the games from both regions? I cannot seriously see how someone can say they aren't close based on the playoffs performances of both regions. I cannot in good faith say Origen is far ahead, if at all, than any top 4 NA team.\n","\"absolutely outclassing other western ADCs like Rekkles, Tabzz, Vardags.\"\n\nHow can you put vardags there ? and when he absolutely outclassed Tabbz ? They went even in lane and teamfight presence in the 2 times they faced each other (worlds S4)","Vardags played against in the IEM SJ final, so I put him in there\n\n\nAnd he did outclass Tabzz in those games, he was consistently up in CS during both games. During both games Sneaky had way more impact, compared to Tabzz who had a comp built around him in game 1. They absolutely did not go even in lane despite ALL having the better botlane matchup imo.","Or you dunno what outclass mean or you are seriously trolling.\n\nNo one ( relevant i mean so analysts/casters) has ever said that Sneaky was close to be the best western player at any time in his carreer and no one has ever said that sneaky was better than tabbz in these 2 games ( stats are not even in his favor and no he wasnt up in cs in lane (and tabbz was playing with Nyph ...) )\n\nFor vardags my point was that he was never considered as a good ADC, he was among the worst ADC who ever played in LCS and got hard carried in his whole career.","1. Perkz or Forgiven were easily equal or better than Trick during the split. Even if Trick were the best performer, it doesn't help your argument in any way, since it's not an NA player. In fact if it would be an NA player it would be several tiers below the current LCS pool of players. \nAnd you can't just give Sneaky the title of best player out of nowhere, even if your PTL Riot buddies have fetched this 'story-line' in the boring pre-season with no high competitive games.\n\n2. If you're gonna count that 'recent' tournament which was more like a showmatches than an actual tournament then why call my other arguments strawmanning? Because if we count All-Stars 2014 then let's count all the IEMs and all World championships back to Season 1 where Fnatic won? But I'm sure you're gonna count everything before All-stars 2014 not recent anymore, very convenient. If we talk about the tournament itself it was just one team and if you go read back Fnatic was literally partying their balls off and showing up hungover. It's pretty obvious that the old Fnatic choose to not give a fuck unless it's an actual important tournament like the EU LCS playoffs. Why do you think sOAZ suddenly stomped people recently in the playoffs?\n\n3. In fact let's turn around this one too then. If EU supposedly went 0-6 to Koreans in the semi-finals (which doesn't help your argument, again). Then let's bring up S4 worlds. \n\nTSM won vs SK gaming but without Svenskeren, when he comes back they get pretty much stomped and styled on. Score's 1-1.\nFnatic pretty much needed 1 more hit on the nexus vs OMG and nearly got out of the group of death. They also went 1-1 with \"NA's\" LMQ.\nAlliance also went 1-1 vs NA's Cloud 9. But threw vs Kabum because they wanted a style-win, Wickd has never played Kayle before.\n\nSo no. Embarrassing shit doesn't just happen to any region all the time. With embarrassing I mean playing well below competitive level and going 0-10 in the second week of a World Championship. Not barely not making it, that's just tough luck where you just gotta try again next year, which EU did and got 2 teams into semi-finals. \n\n&gt; I cannot seriously see how someone can say they aren't close based on the playoffs performances of both regions\n\nIf you really were to judge that it would heavily favor EU, I've no idea how you came to that conclusion honestly. If TSM won it I could understand it a bit since they have powerhouse europeans. But CLG and IMT? They will get shit on in any international tournament. CLG already has been, By a 3rd place Fnatic (they were 6th back then).\n\n","1. I was just pointing out Trick to be ironic, I obviously didn't intend it any other way so I'm not sure why you're being dense here. I've also never seen an episode of PTL so I'm not sure what you're referring to.\n\n2. &gt;Fact 2: The best Western team at any given time has almost always been European.\n\nI seriously don't know if you have reading comprehension skills but this is the point I am arguing. I am NOT saying NA has always been better than EU. You seem to be triggered by even the idea that NA was better than EU for a period of time that you've completely missed my point. And as for All-Stars 2014, jesus, you have proposed an awful point. If you're saying AS2014 was not a serious tournament, then I can say that MSI last year was not an important tournament either. They are the same thing. Literally the only stark difference is within the name, which seems to have thrown you off to make it seem like it's not important. I don't know how you came to the conclusion that they were hungover or partying like crazy but it doesn't let you just dismiss the tournament from existence just because it's convenient and fits your agenda.\n\n3 TSM vs. SK game two? TSM got stomped on styled on? Ok I think this is a pointless argument. You have NO idea what you are talking about and are literally making shit up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Sbd204IUC4\nI don't know how delusional or ignorant you can be to write that entire paragraph. In what way was this game a stomp, please please elaborate? Secondly, Wickd has never played Kayle? Alliance wanted a style win on Kabum? Jesus Christ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sye20J_Ed1o Well here he is playing it in a game where you can't claim a bullshit \"style win\" to be desired. Wickd absolutely practiced this well going into Worlds. So yes absolutely embarrassing shit does happen to every region, which is also irrelevant to objective of my initial comment regardless. Your bias and delusion is extremely clear here and you point out yet again by claiming NA's only chance internationally is through \"powerhouse europeans.\" Also, CLG got shit on? Please stop exaggerating to make your case sound remotely legitimate. Literally every point you made is either an intentional lie, or just false.","&gt; I was just pointing out Trick to be ironic\n\nOh I'm sorry It didn't get detected by my ironic meter, better check it first so I can know it beforehand (Are you an idiot lol?). \n\nI was referring to PTL because I still don't know where you and your delusional NA fanboyism get the idea that Sneaky was at some point the best player. 3 replies later and I still don't have any link to a noteworthy analyst/caster/coach that said that.\n\nAbout AS2014, I said that Fnatic didn't take it serious, learn to read honestly. They just won EU playoffs and decided to party instead of practicing properly, go look it up it was all over reddit. If you hold this against MSI where TSM clearly did practice and the stakes were much higher (bigger prizepool and no showmatches like URF), then you're again very delusional or you have selective memory as I said earlier. Yeah Fnatic fucked up and made EU look weaker at that point, but just look at the IEMs before that tournament. http://lol.gamepedia.com/IEM_Season_VIII_-_World_Championship\n\nAlso I've no idea what 'point' you're trying to make. Your point doesn't even make sense, you're just trying to justify NA's terrible performances over the year by saying EU also made these errors. But my point against that is that it's really not the same. EU vs NA in S4 worlds they all went 1-1, made a few mistakes but not to the same extent as going 0-10 in a professional competitive World Champion goddam ship. That's apples and oranges.\n\n&gt; I am NOT saying NA has always been better than EU. You seem to be triggered by even the idea that NA was better than EU for a period of time that you've completely missed my point.\n\nThen what is your point? That NA/EU is superclose? Because they're not. They were about even in S4, that was once. Like I said EU had some tough luck against teams like OMG and Svenskeren getting banned, but they bounced back the next year and showed actual results **in multiple tournaments with multiple teams**. Want to be superclose buddies with EU? Show results. Because yeah CLG got shit on earlier in IEM, that's your current #1 NA team right there. How am I suppose to take this serious?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","&gt;I still don't have any link to a noteworthy analyst/caster/coach that said that.\n\nStill I don't have any caster or commentator saying anyone else was any better but since some redditor said it has to be false. Sneaky wasn't the best because you say so, however I at least linked videos and tournaments that DO prove Sneaky was the best at the time.\n\nAlso, AS2014 is now does not matter because Fnatic didn't take it seriously (yet obviously no source) because it fits your agenda. Great. Prizepool much higher? 50k vs 100k is really that big? Hmm... ok well since this MSI is 250k I guess TSM didn't try as hard last year either. Rumor has it that TSM was partying last year after they beat C9 in the finals. \n\n&gt;Also I've no idea what 'point' you're trying to make.\n\nWell that's great, but here's the comment I replied to that you conveniently skipped over, https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4g7po4/korean_reactions_to_hotshotggs_tweet_during_lck/d2fao5x\n\nMy point is that I am justifying NA's performances over the years by saying EU also made these errors? What? You have to have some reading comprehension issues, because I never claimed that as my point. The OP made some ridiculous claims and said they were \"facts\" which they absolutely were not, and I refuted them. My point wasn't even that NA/EU were superclose at the moment (though they are close). During the span of months in S4 I am referring to NA and EU were not equal, they were close, as evidence by these: \n\nhttp://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/All-Star_Paris_2014\nhttp://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/2014_Season_World_Championship\nhttp://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/2014_Season_World_Championship\nhttp://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/IEM_Season_IX_-_World_Championship\nhttp://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/IEM_Season_IX_-_Cologne\n\n\nThen you go on this spiel and talk about EU's success after 2015, bringing up the recent IEM world champs etc. Seriously don't know why you insist on strawmaning so hard here but for the 3rd time, I am NOT SAYING NA is better than EU at the moment. My comments are refuting the bullshit claims the OP made about NA never being better than EU, but you took it as a personal attack and brought up the most irrelevant information, and intentionally lying to make a point. (I also find it funny that you consider the OMG v FNC game close, however TSM got stomped/styled on by SK, since both games were extremely close.) I am done commenting on this thread btw but I hope you can see what the actual objective of the initial comments were.","&gt; My point wasn't even that NA/EU were superclose at the moment (though they are close). During the span of months in S4 I am referring to NA and EU were not equal, they were close, as evidence by these:\n\nSo your point is that during S4 EU and NA were close? If that truly is your utterly weak point that you're trying to make then why even bother writing so much shit honestly? You go on about going 0-6 vs KR(in his 3rd fact) and everyone makes embarrassing mistakes(fact 4) and blablabla. It's not even relevant, which makes me think you didn't even know what point to make because you're trying to cover every front even before I replied to you\n\nTherefore YOU are the one who has reading problems because he said(in fact 1 and 2), \"**almost always**\". The exception is arguably season 4 world championship. We still have 2011-2013 and 2015 which is obviously the majority, therefore his facts stand solid. You didn't refute a single one.\n\n&gt;I am NOT SAYING NA is better than EU at the moment.\n \nYeah but my argument is that EU is largely ahead last season and potentially this one too (and seasons before that). Therefore it makes the guy's facts EVEN MORE solid by showing they are miles ahead. How is it strawmanning if it supports my argument? (fact 1 and 2)\nI'm gonna go ahead and tell you that M5 and CLG.EU were semi-finalists too in season 2, just because I know this annoys you. It's not strawmanning it's history. In season 2 EU was WAY more ahead than NA who lost every single game except maybe one. I say this because history repeats clearly in season 5. Therefore it supports my argument.\n\nI like your attempt at trying to bring EU down and NA up but it's just not happening by the looks of it, looking forward to more salty NA tears at MSI.\n\nOh and you linked me to IEMs where CLG and DIG got defeated by GMB. And yea nice win by TSM, shame that they went 1-4 at MSI, the skill gods must have sucked it all out of them.\n","&gt; Sneaky was at one point the best Western player during a lot of 2014 into pre-season 2015.\n\nWait what ? Where the fuck you took that from ?","Oh god you have no idea","\"NA lost all the games that they lost\"... Way to nitpick the fuck out of those groups. They went 6-3 the first week and 0-9/0-10 the seconds week, making a total of 6/13. It's not a good result, so no need to exaggerate it to fit your narrative.","You went from facts to cj. Also seriously, where are the NA fans that think they are better or equal to EU or KR? This seems like some massive cj to just shit on NA fans. Read through this thread, 90% of comments are NA fans saying, \"yeah we know we suck.\" Wanna talk about delusional fans? I can list some of the plethora of comments I've gotten from fnc fans that would make your head spin.\n\nThere is always going to be people who are ignorant and delusional, but it seems that people love to just tear NA a new asshole whenever one random \"NA fan\" says something not vested in reality, instead of just shutting the commentor down it's \"NA is trash and all the fans are delusional idiots.\"","Fact 1 : The best player at any given time has always been Korean.\n\nFact 2 : The best team at any given time has almost always been Korean(TPA never forget)\n\nFact 3 : Europe got two teams at semis because they got luck of the draw, they got to dodge all the Koreans in quarterfinal\n\nFact 4 : EU got 0-6'd in semis, and this fact backs up fact 3.\n\n\nI'm not denying that NA sucks, they really do(CLG with their 'must-win bracket' lol), but let's not put things like 'EU DID SOMETHING UNLIKE NA'. All other regions are shit if we look at things in Korean team's point of view. Hell, like 'best in western smth smth' means a shit.","&gt; Fact 1 : The best player at any given time has always been Korean.\n\nWait who was the best player in S1, S2 and early S3 ? Its actually not a fact and highly arguable ( Madlife maybe but not early S3)\n\n","First, S1 was a complete joke, It wasn't even 'competitive LoL' back then. S2 Madlife, or arguably Toyz but Madlife simply set the current roaming-support meta so I put Madlife higher. S3... debatable, but (Until Faker's debut) There was Shy, Ambition, and Pray.","Not really sure you watched it since you put Toyz who had one good tournament and even TPA was more about teamplay and different style than individuals.\n\nOr pray in early S3 when Weixiao was better.\n\nOverall its arguable because there were Misaya, Weixiao, Froggen, Diamond in S2 and early S3 who had argument for a period of time while since Faker arrived in the scene, he was the pretty much uncontestable best player for 3 seasons in a row (only Dade for a short period of time could contest his reign)","Yeah, hence why I didn't actually put Toyz as the best player but TPA as the best team.\n\nWeixiao and Misaya are honestly too overhyped in S3 era; Actually, Team WE as a whole were too overhyped. They were constantly losing to iG, and OMG in china, mainly because Misaya got pwned by Zzitai and Weixiao pretty much not doing anything. They were good in S2 but never the best, and fell off hard in S3.\n\nSame goes with Froggen and Diamond. Diamond gave up his Best Jungler title to Insec in early S3, and S3 Froggen in EG didn't really achieve anything.","Depent on what you call early S3. Imo Early S3 means mostly just post worlds S2 (IPL5, IEM cologne before LCS and before Faker appear in the scene)  where WE was the best team in the world. (the IPL5 run was pretty clear)\n\nFroggen was still on CLG.Eu (EG start in LCS ), Diamond and Insec are arguable (Insec did great at IEM cologne group, Diamond did great at Katowice (2-0 AZF and AFB)","Actually post S2 worlds to S3 LCS era was called the 'pre-season 3' but mkay, I get your point. Though, what I call 'Early S3' is the 'Start of actual S3 tourneys ~ Allstars' era.","wait the S3 patch (begining of the season) was earlier than LCS no ? IRRC LCS first game was already like on patch 3.3/ 3.4 but i might be wrong","name checks out.","Allow me to offer my condolences on the fact that you're not Korean, and probably, in fact, American, and as white as snow.","Nope, [here](https://i.imgur.com/07cq13z.png)'s my Inven logged-in screenshot. Remember, they don't allow you to sign up unless you have a KSSN and a phone linked to it ;)\n\nSo... yeah. Allow me to offer MY condolences on the fact that you guys are actually considered as delusional as NA fans, at least to Korean fans' view. Not only me, but pretty much the whole Korean league fanbase.","Weebs often go to great lengths. This is unsurprising. The fact that you're initial response was A. completely irrelevant to my own post, and B. somewhat emotional, shows that your personal pride and feelings have been hurt.\n\nAs for me, I deal in facts. That's why you will see no where do I claim any region is close to Korea because they have clearly been dominant in international tournaments. This does not upset me. It is simply a statement of fact.\n\nMy post was concerning reddit's logic of NA=EU. Once again, the fact, that you chose to go off on an unrelated tangent shows that you're personally and emotionally invested in this.\n\nIt's also a typical response for NA fans to resort to the KR&gt;all 'argument' when discussing their own region's strength in relation to others. It's a way to shut down a rather uncomfortable conversation.","I clearly stated my point, but it seems like you did not get it so here we go again; 'KR&gt;&gt;&gt;NA=EU=Everyone else, in our perspective, because the gap between Korea and any other region is so fkin huge. It doesn't matter who beats who in the west, because you guys are all trash.'\n\nSo, tell me how my pride and feelings can be hurt when I don't even sympathize with any NA team. Also tell me how hitting simple printscreen key could be a 'great length'?\nDon't even try to convince me about you using facts, because Your 'fact' that I am not Korean is already exposed, and now it seems like you're just beating around the bush. \n\nYou still think the inven screenshot is not enough and I'm American? Well, [Ta-Fucking-da](http://i.imgur.com/okTMf2B.jpg), mate.","Okay see you're doing this thing where you're making fun of NA fans for being delusional while you are just as delusional yourself. The only problem is, yours are worse because you got semis so you think your team was actually top 4 in the world at one point, and that you getting to semis had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the two Korean teams met in the quarterfinals, the fact that Korea could only have 3 teams at the tournament, China went to shit, and the good TW team met SKT in the quarters. ","1,2. Facts, lol\n3. NA got two teams further than EU at worlds season 4.\n4. NA managed to go 6-3 first day of worlds","well the only year EU didn't make it to the semis was season 4, the only year NA made it into semis was season 1, friendly reminder EU won in an EU final... ","Yeah S4 was only season when NA did better, 1 of 5.","You need context, first:\n\n- SK got their best player banned. \n\n- Alliance lost to a brazilian team after they perfect game NJWS","3 and 4 are correct, but you could make arguments that Doublelift was the best western player in seasons 2 and 3, and that TSM and C9 were the best western teams at the end of Season 4. All up for debate.","Surely Froggen was better than Doublelift in season 2? Some considered him the best in the world at that time nevermind the west.","DL was in consideration after Weixiao for best ADC. Froggen and Diamond were at the top in S2.","&gt; The best Western player at any given time has almost always been European.\n\nSeason 1 was bigfatlp. Season 2 was DL. Season 3 idk there weren't many good western players but Turtle was actually really good back then. Season 4 bjerg. Season 5 bjerg. Season 6 is WIP. I wouldn't say 1/2 is almost always european.","The problem is that even with the other regions all being together in agreement that NA is weak they still can't accept their current standing.\n\n\nNothing wrong with being a weaker region, you don't see the wildcard being deluded like NA acts at times. Just grind away and improve so that is no longer the case, till then keep the bad mouthing of other regions to a minimum.","Don't worry, na is reminded how bad they are every ducking time a post about na is on the front page. It literally turns into a shit on na thread.","They maybe players from NA should stop trying to overhype their region, then you wouldn't set yourself up to get bashed on. If an EU player said EU is very close to Korea right now, has a good chance at winning worlds etc., it would get the exact same reaction this thread is getting.","Lol no it wouldnt, because those threads were all over the fucking place between msi and world's last season.","Nope. I've never seen a post/comment with positive karma claiming that EU had a decent chance to win last worlds.","It's incredibly sad how we have clear definitely difference in power between region thats enforced years after years by Riot segregating them by having monopoly on competitive LoL. I doubt anything will change. KR will dominate this game till the world stop playing LoL","I think the segregation itself was a good thing in terms of being healthy for the competitive scene. No one likes to watch their region get stomped week after week by Koreans playing in leagues outside of Korea for easier competition. We have seen what happens in other games that Koreans focus on when those safeguards aren't in place. \n\n\nI just wish we'd see some more international matches that we currently do.","Your environment will either build you up or spit you out. If 2-3 korean teams come to LCS, LCS native will adapt. Remember when an all Chinese team came to NA and crush all competition? Oh wait, TIP didn't do that. Yeah, gaming success isn't genetic or anything. Monte said something to this effect that if a team wants to win Worlds, they should go to Korea and fight. If current TSM go to OGN, I bet they could beat their bottom 2-3 teams consistently. And after 2-3 season I bet they could be competitive with the top half. Maybe they wont ever win an OGN champion; but I bet they'd be 5 times the team they could ever be if they just stayed in NA.","If you didn't have the safeguards in place and the limited path into the LCS how many team slots for a season would get eaten by Korean teams? You'd see a lot of Korean B teams filtering over because they'd still be able to take spots from the home country teams. \n\n\nLook what happened to StarCraft 2, it became a foreigner graveyard. A couple of individual players rose to a level to win an odd tournament here or there off the Koreans but otherwise it was a foreigner wasteland. This was the exact reason NA and EU introduced the region rules in contested games to begin with.\n\n\nSuccess isn't genetic, it is cultural, which is why the Koreans are more successful. Esports has been a viable career path in Korea before Moba's even existed.\n\n\nTIP failed for many reasons, if you think it was the NA competition that did it I don't know what to say to you.\n\n\nI'd take the bet about TSM beating the bottom teams consistently. Who would they even train against? Back in Broodwar and SC2 days when foreigners tried to compete in Korea they have would trouble finding people to actually practice with and those they did practice with often turned around and shared with the other Korean players the strats they were using. There are other factors but that is a good starting point.\n\n\nKorea would break TSM just like it did when CLG went over during their prime.","TIP before having any ownership problem was never a dominant force in LCS - the highest ever placed was 4th and after only two season they was relegated. If you thing a B-tier KR team could just come in and destroy NA/EU LCS you're dead wrong. \n\nAlso, comparing CLG performance in a single tournament back in 2012 to current situation is hilarious and completely irrelevant.\n ","What? before their ownership issues and rebranding to TiP they stomped their way into NALCS and qualified for worlds. The same season the ownership issues occurred, they had to rebrand, and they had to rebuild the team. \n\nI think your timeline is messed up.\n\nA newly put together team made worlds. That is with players having issues with English, lack of training partners they could communicate with, and having to deal with adjusting to living in the US. These would be less of an issue if a wave of teams came over.\n\nAs for CLG. They were one of the most successful teams on the International stage NA had ever produced. More successful than any since. I thought I was being generous using the team with the strongest International performances and at their highest peak that NA has ever put up in my example.","I'm not going to continue this conversation since we clearly live in 2 different world. \n\nLMQ got 3rd which qualified them for Worlds, and definitely didn't stop their way there with 18:10 record. They looked nowhere near as good as when C9 first came onto the scene, or IMT for that matter. \n","[deleted]","honestly some japanese or brazilian teams could easily compete in NA.","Yeah and some can easily compete with Eu to as they have in the past.  Eu needs to get over this weird cockiness like they are almost to Korea and miles ahead of other regions.  Basically they have gotten the furthest recently because of bracket paths and they played Koreans last.  Na was even with iem at Iem kato for instance in head to head.  \n\nAnd not to mention Eu had to surrender at 20 vs Korea in that same tournament.  ","Hotshotgg is obviously delusional and he's NA resident, yes, but fans.. IDK. Every single non-LCK fans are a bit delusional from my view tbh; \n\nI'll say it this way.

Any other 'league winners' are going to get shitstomped by SKT or ROX.

Your comment goes well with the NA mentality too ;)","I agree with you and I'm a NA fan. Season 4 Koreans were actually afraid of TSM and were scared that they might even have a chance against samsung. Also TSM did look pretty good in IEM Katowice but even then, it was only IEM.

It's so stupid to trash talk when you haven't even really placed in worlds. \n\n\nOne reason I really like TSM. They may be overconfident when it comes to NA but they respect the shit out of foreign competition and usually make judgement on how well they do after scrims with those teams. CLG on the other hand just get too cocky because they dump on NA teams and then have no respect because their ego's get too big.

Better results than na for sure, but s1 is basically irrelevant, s2 is somewhat relevant.

Unlike Korea, China, or Europe. NA and Japan's gaming cultures are more console focused compared to PC. Which is why Americans dominate the console shooters and have a very heavy presence at the top of Smash while Japan is strong the Street Fighters scene and Pokemon.","[deleted]","Facts = excuses now? \n\nLol what the fuck would you know about the social culture of the US and Canada being an European?","[deleted]","&gt;And what the fuck would you know about Japans gaming culture being an American? \n\nBy it being a known fact?

For such a big gaming country, wouldn't it make sense for them to have a good presence in esports? Guess why they don't? BECAUSE THEY ARE A CONSOLE AND HANDHELD COUNTRY. It took the biggest online game in the world for Japan to even get a real esports team on a PC game. Even then, on OP.GG, Japan has only around 56k total ranked players. For a country of more than double the size of South Korea in population, Japan doesn't even have 1/20th of the ranked playerbase SK has. Japan produces the top handheld and 2 of the 3 major consoles...\n\n&gt;You're trying to shift underperformance on the most competitive games in the West on cultural preferances... Like that matters a single fucking bit.\n\nPlease do explain why the US dominates in console esports while never being a big force in any semi major PC esports. \n\n&gt;If there's inherently more interest in console games in the US how do you explain NA LCS still nets more viewers then any of the aforementioned titles? Because the playerbase is bigger? And how come it is, if the focus is more on console games? Sorry but what a load of bs.\n\nEU literally has double NA's playerbase when you combine EUW and EUNE. NA LCS having a bigger viewership just means more people watches NA LCS. NA teams also have more fans. TSM flairs are literally about 50% of this entire sub's team flairs. In the top 5 flair count in this sub, 4 out of the 5 are NA teams with just FNC at 4th place. Two of EU's biggest fanbases were CLG EU and M5, both teams/orgs doesn't even exist anymore in the EU LCS. Meanwhile, TSM, CLG, TL/CRS still exists in NA and C9 was created and became largely popular. EU basically only have FNC and OG in terms of fanbase. \n\nSorry, but you lack critical thinking skills. ","[deleted]","&gt;You weren't able to backup a single assumption of yours with actual facts. You are literally basing the last part of your post about which team has the most flairs on a subreddit, like what the actual fuck.\n\nI literally gave you ranked playerbases of Korea and Japan and the fact that Japan produces Playstation and Wii. The US being a console heavy country is also a fact, considering that I live here and spends a shit ton of time around people of my demographic. Maybe you should try reading. \n\n&gt;You are literally basing the last part of your post about which team has the most flairs on a subreddit, like what the actual fuck.\n\nIts to show popularity of teams among a big userbase. Reddit is used by both NA players and EU players. \n\n&gt;We were talking about other genre's fanbases based on cultural interest, shouldn't that if anything reaffirm your argument of console games being the main focus of American gaming culture, seeing as a majority of american stream viewers would watch said games?\n\nNo, you dingus. Behavior of the NA LoL playerbase doesn't reflect the behaviors of the entire population of NA. That just means the NA teams have more popularity among its own playerbase and among foreign playerbases. Go compare NA streamers and EU streamers. Bjergsen went from a 2k viewer stream to 30k+ viewer stream by just joining TSM. NA players and teams straight up have more popularity among the playerbase. The only time NA LCS even gets big numbers are during TSM games. Go see the G2 vs OG series and the TSM vs CLG series on the same day. Then go see H2K vs FNC and TL vs IMT. TSM vs CLG's had 600k+ on Twitch while all the others are getting 200k to 400k.\n\n&gt;But I'm sure you are right and the viewership counts from NA are 80% EU people, makes perfect sense, since, you know...\n\nNo. that makes no sense. How the fuck does that make perfect sense?\n\nI had actually gave you real numbers and have real life experience to back up my claims. You have nothing other than some bullshit like how it makes perfect sense for NA LCS to be 80% EU viewership.","Let me know when EU actually wins anything relevant in MOBAs.

It has more to do with culture than it does infrastructure.\n\nKorea's culture raises many players who're playing with a greater drive to win. Winning for Koreans means possible career opportunity. Winning in the West just means winning because being a \"professional gamer\" is unlikely or has been \"looked-down\" upon in the past (it still is to an extent). This is why the difference in quality Ranked Games are night and day between the regions.\n\nLook at the LMS as an example; they've improved drastically because they started playing Korean Ranked Games instead of Garena. I would not be surprised to see them take the #1 spot back in the near future.\n\nROX Tigers, the #2 team in the World back in 2015 plays the game in a PC Cafe with no Sponsors. Heck, they still have no sponsors right now and pay for their expenses using only tournament prize money and streaming income.\n\nTaking something more serious (work) doesn't necessarily mean it becomes less fun.

It's bullshit and while I agree there are reasons to criticize their play and that they are generally the weakest links on the team, half of the criticism they've received has had everything to do with community circlejerks against them. Last split reddit wanted Xmithie kicked from the team, remember? Looking back that looks like a fucking stupid thing to say right? Oh he missed a Sej ult, he's the worst Jungler in NA! Kick him now! Uh, no.\n\nIt's just stupid how quick this community is to turn on players and Huhi and Stixxay have suffered from that. That's all I'm saying.","top and supp are better for clg.  adc is pretty even considering both adcs strengths and weaknesses.  Jungle is clearly slanted in tricks favor, but xmithie rarely gets smashed rather graciously falls behind.  \nmid is just a rofl stomp for perkz.   I give g2 the edge just off that massive skill gap.","People said the same thing with Bjerg vs Huhi, but we saw how well that worked out. ","I agree but i also think perkz is a lot more aggressive and punishing then bjerg.  Id take trick perkz over xmithie huhi in a skirmish any day...i think if clg can stay calm in the aggression they will win do to better communication and map movements.  ","Except Perkz is way better than bjerg ","whew, the ego after a single split win","He has the solo kills and stats and wins to back it up though","2nd place vs 1st place oh my hes sooo much better, bjerg is good and perkz is probably a bit better but not \"wayy better\"","It's worthless talking to this guy. [Literally everything about EU is better than NA.](http://i.imgur.com/YjEZhw9.png)","No worries, he's only been around for 8 days. Flaired up as the #1 team in his favorite region, as you do, and flames everyone who disagrees with him. \n\nCheck back and see if he's still rocking G2 if they suffer an embarrassing loss or two at some point.","It's not the same region though...","LOL","He has been this split, he's been dominating vs EU mid laners who have proven time and time again that they are on an international level. If EU loses internationally you can almost guarantee it wasn't the mid laners fault. ","You can't compare Bjerg to Perkz where Perkz has only played VS EU teams whereas Bjerg has CONSISTENTLY performed against international teams. When Perkz does well internationally, that's another story, but for now you can't just put the title best western mid on him.","&gt;He has been this split\n\n&gt;this split\n","&gt; He has been this split\n&gt; this split\n\nAgain, Bjerg has proved his champ pool is very versatile and performs in nearly every game he plays. You can't give Perkz the title until he goes international.","I might argue that Emperor's tendency to go super ham compared to Stixxay's ability to backline DPS super safely would give Stixxay the edge.\n\nOtherwise, Perkz is either the first or second best mid in the west and I think Trick is undoubtedly the best jungle.

They can never take that away from us! ","Well, they own Riot.","Even Reddit comments aren't as dumb as hotshot ","from NA - criticism is warranted","How have you not learned to use \"JK\" after everything by now. Save yourself a headache mate!\n","Just like politics the damage is already done when writing stuff like this mate","Athena was arguably their best player? Eh, pretty sure Loken is by far their best player, but yeah Athena is great too.","Imagine if LMS managed to play top NA teams in season 4, probably would have rekt them. Oh wait they did and got shit fucked by C9 and TSM ","Yeah, lms only really got good after the TW scene split from the rest of SEA, TW is much more competetive with all the shit countries filtered out","Wheres NA at? Not here.","What if an NA team goes to EU/KR to bootcamp. Would they improve?","They might improve a little bit if they're super talented and very quick to learn. I think they'd have to bootcamp for a few weeks assuming they even meet those basic requirements to get anything useful out of the experience. But bootcamping isn't gonna fix years of learned behavior for most people. It'd take months if not years of constant competitive play to fix that kind of thing, I think.\n\nI think the best example you can look at is Dota. China completely dominated the Dota scene for like 10 years, and they still to this day win every other International in Dota2. And even when they don't win, they take atleast 2 of the top 5 positions. But it took over 10 years of competitive play with NA, EU, and CN playing against each other CONSTANTLY before NA and EU were considered on the same level as CN. Even NA, which was once considered the worst region in Dota, has now won an International.\n\nLCS effectively reduces the skill level of all regions by keeping all of the regions restricted to playing with each other. Every other esport has inter-region play constantly. LOL is the only esport that has pretty much no inter-region play. They're handicapping their own players by doing so. Hell, even Korea would get better if they constantly played against NA and EU.","Some even think they are better than EU in CS, where they havent won vs EU at an event for like 6 years.","Nobody thinks that","Check the comment above you lol","What did it say? It got deleted.","I don't know, when I commented there was a different comment at the top","sure Bud","I commented to /u/Hartep just when he posted his comment, so it was still at the top. If you scroll down you can find his comment hidden because its been downvoted a lot.

How did they lose more than EU and still win?","BUT MUH TOP HEAVY WEIGHTING\n\nTSM &gt; LEMONDOGS IS MORE RELEVANT THAN ALTERNATE &gt; CLG","And it wasn't even the actual Lemondogs lineup IIRC.","All 5 players from summer split had left the team and they fielded a squad that wouldnt even be able to compete in challenger","The org was probably contacting some random Challenger players with \"Yo dawg you wanna play on international League of Legends stage FOR FREE?

You're just complaining because you lost lol","No matter who won, when the result looks like [this](http://puu.sh/ouCel/2a56954af9.png) it's hard to take it seriously. Perhaps you're right that I wouldn't go around whining about it if we won, but I'd not be able to find any pride in it because I'd look like an idiot. Maybe you feel threatened because I'm talking about one of your few victories, but \n\n&gt;\"You're just complaining because you lost lol\". \n\nWhat are you, 14?","&gt;Perhaps you're right that I wouldn't go around whining about it if we won\n\n&gt;\"You're just complaining because you lost lol\".\nWhat are you, 14?\n\nWat.. You just validated my comment and then shit on it? lol k\n\nIf EU was in the same position as NA and won BOTA by winning the showcase match, you would not be complaining. That was my point. The tourney was structured so that higher-seeded games were more valuable to the regions score. That makes a ton of sense to me because I care way more about no. 1 vs no. 1 than no. 5 vs no. 5. I don't see the flaw to that logic.","Both were done with EU players and due to an EU player, except the C9 run at S4 Worlds\n\nHai's Zed never forget.","Yeah, I also saw Doublelift win a soloq game vs Froggen","S4 if c9 and tsm didnt do as well as they did it would be considered choking as well. To be honest they still did a little bit, tsm could have came in 1st in their group, same with c9. They were pretty inconsistent in terms of their play level. I think that was the only season where na really was ahead though. ","Lol EU choked last year, China choked this year. It is how it is. ","[deleted]","You know those NA fans who make bs excuses to defend their region? You're showing us the EU equivalent","To be fair, two of those reasons are pretty fair to make. Nobody expected FNC to make it through groups, and the fact they got close it pretty suprising. SK did go 2-1 with sven and 0-3 without sven. The only weak excuse is the ALL vs kabum excuse tbh.","Right? I think the best thing we've learned from this is that even though EU is also a garbage reason, they'll grab onto anything they can to shit on NA. \n\nLove all of these EU fans acting like 1) hotshot = all of NA (many NA players are fully aware of how good Korea is comparatively, hotshot has always been a fucking moron), and 2) EU is any more comparable to Korea. Every single thing the Koreans said is valid for EU too. Do they show up better than NA? Yup. Do they get assraped by every other region? Also yup.  ","The honest truth is Korea has been making every other region their bitch the past few seasons. NA, EU, doesn't matter, we're all lowly ants.\n\nThere are some salty EU players that have to shit on NA to make them feel better about themselves, but the honest fact is that we're all bronze compared to the Korean teams and it has been that way for many seasons.","Yeah. Honestly to me this comment section makes EU look way worse than NA. They're like the fat nerdy kid that hangs out with the bully and holds other kids to be punched in order to be teased slightly less. ","Yeah but EU fans need to make excuses for one tournament. NA fans need to make them for all tournaments.","You realize you are proving my point, right?","Alliance struggled when they didnt have irelia. A good team cant rely on 1 champion. ","But dude, they got top 4. Must be good no?","That was the first tournament in a very long time where a North American team got out of groups. ","with an EU player being the carry and star player of the team :-)","In the case of Liquid, yes. CLG managed to get out with only a European coach.","Not necessarily, they had adreN who went crazy a lot of the games","And facing another NA team in the QF.","CLG also made it out of groups and EliGE and adreN played phenomenally in the Fnatic game that got them out of groups","Hiko carried way harder than s1mple. Sure s1mple got some nice picks but then made some bonehead plays and lost his team awps round after round.","Lol, fuck off. S1mple was the third best rated player at the event, he may do stupid shit but he was still a hard carry..","He killed people, that's what his rating says. His team invested so much into him so that he could hard carry and he tosses the awp round after round by doing stupid shit like pushing when the bomb is down and giving his team economic disadvantages. If hiko's playstyle was that of a carry and not a lurk he could have done what s1mplw did and more since he wouldnt do stupid crap every round","Sure thing Cx","Hey man, EU does love to use that when saying shit like this about LoL even though both are pretty shit compared to the east, so i don't see why not use it there.","Difference is, you don't just have the major to look at in terms of international results in CS which is why people downplay Liquids top 4 finish because not only can we look at who they played but also how they do in the other top level tourneys they attend.(such as DH Malmo that just happened) \n\nOne of the things I absolutely hate about LoL because one single result means the world to people. Not the fault of the fans to think this way because what else do they have to go off on for comparison, nothing.","gotta love how some call Luminosity an NA team when they are from Brazil, but on league nobody calls brazilian teams NA teams.","NA = North America\n\nBrazil = Located in South America\n\n???","in CS people argue that since Luminosity is an NA org then they are a NA team, even though by that logic fnatic and dignitas are from the UK, and Virtus.Pro are russian.","Australian?","\ni don't know why i thought fnatic was created in AU.","Does the FNC team play in the AUS scene?

","&gt; Does the FNC team play in the AUS scene?\n\ni don't know why i thought fnatic was created in AU.\n\n&gt; Also, NA is a continent. Not a country.\n\n3 countries, and it's primarily the USA who are relevant in the scene. and it doesn't matter in this case since the argument is that LG are NOT from Brazil, so it wouldn't matter what country/continent outside of SA you would give.","LG plays and lives in NA. They don't play in the SA scene. They play and practice against other NA teams in the NA scene. FalleN even referred to NA as \"our region\" at MLG during an interview.","Also Liquid would be European.","I've never even heard someone say that. No one called TSM an NA team when they played CS, and the CSGO TSM team was actually good.","You got it all wrong man. When NA teams beat Europeans they get promoted to  being a Brazilian team. \n\nLike liquid.","No its because LG representa NA because they play NA solo queue, and play in NA pro league.

But my other two connections to NA stand. And your point that they would prefer to go to EU to practice is irrelevant because right now theyre not actually doing that, and besides you have no proof that they don't prefer staying in NA and beating up on the weaker pro scene. \n\nAlso thanks for being civil and having a discussion and not mindlessly downvoting (although it doesn't really matter). More than some of the people on reddit today...","why would they prefer to destroy shitters 90% of the time instead of playing and practising against the best in the world? They want to win majors, not shit on pugstars in NA.","Point taken, I don't know, but the fact that they're staying in NA and not moving to Portugal or somewhere where they can live speaks more than anything I can say.","Idk. Probably its because of the fact that LG is an American org, LG players plays in the NA scene, LG practices with NA teams, and LG players live in the US. \n\nEven FalleN referred to NA as \"our region\" at MLG. \n\nAre you one of those morons who thinks video game skills are determined by where you came out of your mom's vagina? ","And Luminosity recently lost to a Chinese team in a BO3.","To be fair, Lumi does play in the NA circuit and is based in Cali, so they are practically an NA team though their members aren't North American. ","First of all, most people don't consider Luminosity an NA team and secondly, even if they were, they would be considered NA because they live in NA, practice in NA and compete in NA Leagues, not because brazilians in general are considered NA.

But I'd say Russia did the hard lifting, they took on the majority of the german forces, they ''took back'' (took for themselves, but still) most land and honestly is the main reason Germany lost ww2, not the US. Not because i got anything against the US, i prefer the US over Soviet, but you sadly can't look away from facts. \nAlso the UK helped the US so much by giving them all their research projects (for supplies of course), which included a new radar to help win the battle of the Atlantic! \n\nOf course, i might have misunderstood something and then please correct me, i love learn about history! ","Well yes, Russia did play a huge part. But the US intervening when they did pulled pressure from the Russians as well as the German army overstaying in Stalingrad allowed Russia to muster enough manpower to push the German's out of the Soviet Union and take back most of Eastern Europe.

","&gt; Yo, did you forget about Japan? The US was fighting a two front war. And won on both fronts. Had the US moved their 3,621,383+ troops from the Pacific to EU, they would have shit stomped Hitler regardless of Russia. I would have to say that US and Russia were about 50/50 in contributions to winning Europe, with the US slightly more important because they still had a chance of winning if Russia went down, and Russia would have been absolutely fucked without the USA entering the fight.

","I only see people pick jungle when we have a melee top with no range waveclear, so maybe people just don't get it or something","Smite is just bad when map pressure is what you need. Sure it makes the jungling faster but so does having 80% cdr and no mana/energy costs. Meanwhile the one thing that does gate you in this mode is how long it takes to get from point a to b and TP shits on that.","but you do understand how redsmite works and how by far highest level on the map would pressure the map right  ? and who is to say flash smite is the only possibility. tp smite is legit if u want it.","Sure of course it's a possibility the mode is made for fuckery so do what ever you want. But Flash and TP have significant advantages other than doing minor amounts of damage to champiosn and being able to kill monsters. When everything is broken smite doesn't really provide a decent use as other summoners do.","You realize red smite reduces damage by like 20% from smitten targets","Yes and it also gives bonus true dmg...\n\nBut the point is that you need tp for the fast rotations and map movements","I run ghost/TP on anyone with a dash like Fizz/Ez or on Hecarim/Rammus","well the only time i take smite is for devouer ( or whatever it is caled) on xin :D","It makes me happy seeing you rek all these \"op\" picks in urf.

I unsubscribed his twitch, it's very unpleasant to watch his stream.  \n  \n&gt; When he missplays:  \n  \nand his famous \"Team ? Team ?\"","I make the opposite argument. People of lower skill levels are easier to manipulate. Thats why I can do things that wouldnt work in diamond on a silver or gold smurf. \n\nEdit: Hes also on oce. People that are silver there are most likely bronze because that is an easy region to climb in.","Bronze is bronze in every region, only higher elos are affected in terms of skill.","I'd say top 10 from every region could be challenger in any other region(at least top 10 from soloQ, not DQ), and b5's from every region will be b5 in every region.","dont think so. He had multiple posts here from LAN/LAS Challengers who went to struggle in D5 NA. YOu really cant compare ranks between a \"CN/KR/EU/NA\" Server and the smaller ones.","Thats what my argument is though. Just because of someones rank has nothing to do with his actual mechanical skill. Even if these opportunities presented themselves in bronze/challenger, actually executing them and knowing when to do what is completely different. His thought process is 100% impressive and that's all I'm going to say. ","He's right though. I love both Bubba Kush and Gripex but as I've climbed and mained Lee Sin, you start to really see the fault in Bubba's plays, although they do look fancy.\n\nIf you watch closely, half these clips are the enemy misplaying rather than him outplaying.\n\nThe first Riven flashes on him into tower range w/o 3rd Q and doesn't stun immediately either.\n\nThe poppy 1v1, the poppy NEVER uses her anti-dash ability which would've negated Lee Sin completely.\n\nIn Zed 1v1 he is clearly running right but Zed W's to the left and he W's the length of 1 teemo.\n\nIn the Vayne 1v1 vayne never used condemn.\n\nNow I know its URF so I look past it and some of his plays are still very impressive. But if you go and watch any of his montages, watch the other players and keep your eyes off Lee Sin and you'll notice how they just misplay into him making a big play. And he tries too hard to make something flashy unnecessarily. What makes Gripex and other Lee Sin main's so amazing is that when they pull off a kick-flash it's for a reason, not just to do it. Bubba will do it sometimes when the kill was guaranteed which means his flash is wasted. ","And how does this make a top 50 challenger player bad?","Hes master and hasnt been chall since s4 when ppl were also worse and lee was rly good.","I do feel weird saying this because i know the guy, but an OCE streamer called Cellybeary is pretty outstanding. He's rediculously consistent and way better than gripex imho.","Nah man that simply isn't an option if someone has a low rank is always means they're bad 100% of the time 8)","Faker ended last season in diamond, guess he's not that good compared to all those other people in challenger and masters. ","&gt;Plays well\n\n&gt;At least plat\n\nPlatinum is worse than bronze. ","[deleted]","He actually doesn't play ranked at all. So no, he's not mid diamond. Not sure where you got that from.","He has never been plat or above, your \"im pretty sure\" is wrong.","I checked his profile on mobile, said he was silver. I've gotten messages before saying he's unranked and his ranked TEAM is silver, either way he's against a lower caliber of opponents ","If he's playing normals then his rank has nothing to do with the lvl of his enemies. Separate MMR.","Well browsing through his match history he wins roughly 50% of his games which in ranked would be somewhere in low gold\n\nAlso last season ranked he was negative on Lee Sin","Win rate doesn't determine your rank though","Matchmaking In unranked and ranked are independent. \n\nEdit: so mmr of the two are separate ","He wins roughly half his normal games from what I can tell so his normal MMR isn't phenomenal.\n\nLast season he went negative with Lee in ranked as well","Think he's like a friend of mine then. High elo player who buys accounts and plays mostly on those accounts to stomp in normals. Goes like 27/3 every game, which obviously makes him look like a god. Don't get me wrong. He's a great player. But if he was playing at his own elo he wouldn't look nearly as good. \n\nEdit: Don't really get the downvotes. Isn't it pretty much the same thing? i.e. he's just crushing noobs and making montages out of them","I just burst out laughing. ","I always just jungle him in URF, it's a lot of fun ","do you have 1 million mastery points?","having one million mastery points doesnt make you a good lee sin but atleast you are not a casual anymore\n\nbut you probably still suck","Bubba Kush has 960k Lee Sin points on just his main, so I'd say it's a part of making plays like this.","aka the mastery points are not the main point\n\nyou just get mastery points by playing the champ often enough nothing else\n\nand there are ppl in bronze who have over 4k games palyed\n\ngenius","more lie mishiterous skype group","Also his opponents are really bad at dodging Q.  I can understand getting hit once in awhile, no ones perfect, but to eat 3 or 4 in a single engage is just bad mechanics.","you mean  \"Ho,Lee.FUCK!\"","Wee Too Low","Looks like regular Lee Sin plays to me. ","Recommend watching gripex or rush(or anyone else) if you want to learn lee. This guy shows bad habits and plays against people that are bronze/silver.","I agree 100%. Although you cannot discredit him completely many of his clips are still fantastic, but he does show a lot of poor choices in many of his montages.","His lee is really fun to watch ","I have been called a scripter by hitting a Q on a invisible shaco.......... ^rito^pls","Me too just the other day lol. I knew he was somewhere nearby so I pressed Q and it happened to be the moment that his invis ran out so it looked like I instantly reacted","whats up with the cancer music on videos like these","I swear all montages use the same fucking music.","Nothing special, just making lots of unnecessary ward jumps and missing lots of Q's.\n","So many of those actions are useless and only impressive to plebs.

A relationship requires the agreement of two people, and either of them can end that relationship at any time for any reason. \n\nSometimes things don't work out, it's best to just leave it at that, like you described with your ex. If you explain, oftentimes they'll use that as an excuse to keep in contact and ask you about whyyyy did you break up with meeeee, let's get back together, I can change all those things (they can't), or they'll get offended if you're honest and blow up like this guy.

Also, where do you get that she was the one getting hurt? She seemed to start to have fun at his expense after she was done being polite. Which was good for us, we did get to see a nice guy explode.","I don't like how she handled the picture thing, the guy was right in saying \"How can I respect your boundaries if I don't know them?\", the rest was ok on her part.","She said no multiple times when he asked for photos. You should get a hint.","I would, but she didn't said \"no\", if you read OP's text she mentions she said she couldn't cause she used all her data. \n\nI don't think you're stupid /u/lubeyouup, and I'm not either, we both know what that means and I wouldn't push after an answer like that because *it's obvious*. \n\nBut it's also obvious that OP wasn't interested in being honest and pretended having good times \"not to hurt his feeling\" (but probably more to protect herself and to dodge facing what she feared would be an awkward situation). \n\nLook, it's easy to judge from behind my computer - that's why I'm trying to not do it, I don't condemn OP for doing what she did: we have no idea how it all really went.

She would come up with excuses each time: \"Oh no I'm in my pjs now, no make up, I'm ugly lol you don't wanna see that\" and etc, as it became more clear to him she might simply didn't want to, he came to me in confusion.\n\nHe confessed that he didn't understand, *all the girl he was txting with we're more then willing to do it, in fact some of them were the initiator.*\n\nHe wasn't talking specifically about \"nudes\" pictures, he was simply requesting personal and flirty pictures because in his mind, txting is really impersonal and sending flirty, teasing pictures were a good way to counter that. He didn't understand that a girl wouldn't want to use her physics to woe him over, as it was *clearly* the easiest way for a girl to win a guy over. She would be willing to initiate sex talk with him over txt, but not send pics? *What was wrong with her?*\n\nOf course I explained to him everything that probably came to your mind while reading this post: not every girl is the same, sending pictures can be *dangerous*, maybe she want's to conquer way intellectually before physically, maybe she was simply raised differently and was just more prude, that nothing was wrong with her attitude, etc. But it took a while for him to accept that. By this time, he was already \"pushy\". Had she explained her intention since the beginning they could have sorted this out without it being weird, but it was too late. ","Sending \"flirty\" and \"teasing\" pictures is extremely personal, way more than sex talk, and as you said, it can be dangerous as well.  Its **completely** understandable if a person doesn't want to send pictures of him/herself and if anybody asks again after he/she says no, they're kind of an asshole.

None of my friends seem to have had this problem. I've traveled quite a bit. I've googled looking for cases. I can't fucking find anything. I don't understand why people are so concerned about this problem. Is it a thing somewhere? Are people being plagued by this problem? Because it seems like a lot of panic over an imaginary problem.","Exactly. This is a sexual predator / safety issue, not a trans issue. As soon as the thought of concern comes to mind about my daughter sharing the bathroom with a boy who maliciously pretends to be trans, the next logical step is not freak out about trying to keep him out, but instead teach my daughter that there are some terrible people out there and provide her the tools she needs to be safe and protect herself. She has an insanely higher chance of being abused by a guy dressed as a guy in her dorm bedroom than a guy dressed as a girl in any bathroom. \n\nAs the Catholic priests have shown over the decades, sexual predators do not need a bathroom of the opposite gender to abuse children. \n\nIt doesn't bother me (a man) to use the same bathroom with a gay man, or a woman dressed as a man. That is because bathrooms are not about sex. And if we extend that thought out far enough, doesn't it make sense for us all to just have one bathroom that everyone uses? Seems way more efficient...","If only there was some kind of way we could have privacy in a bathroom...

At this point the only thing that these people are doing is fear mongering. I don't give a shit who uses the bathrooms.\n\nFew months ago I went to take a shit during my lecture and saw a lady in the men's room. Weird, took me back a second thinking I went into the wrong room, checked and saw urinals. Whatever. Finished my shit and she was still doing her makeup in the mirror. Guess what? I wasn't assaulted, raped, or hurt by it in anyway. If someone wants to use the men's room and be subjected to my taco-poo, then by all means go for it.","It isn't an issue of a trans individual doing it but what is to stop someone who is a predator from slapping on clothes and then claiming they are trans when challenged.\n\nIt is a poor justification but the one I see most used. I find the laws to be blatant discrimination and hope the courts do the same. It doesn't seem like these laws would do anything to actually stop predators. I don't see why it matters what bathroom someone uses.","By the same logic, what's to stop a predator who likes little boys from doing the same thing in the men's bathroom? It turns out that most child abuse doesn't start from a kid being picked up in a public area with his/her parents and who knows who else around.","Such a justification assumes we are simply a toilet sign away from a surge in terrible perversion and sexual attacks on women by men. That such people who wish to commit urge driven crimes will absolutely be halted from doing so by a toilet door sign, saying they can't enter. Such bills also demonstrate a lack of care for what goes on in the mens bathroom, because clearly the men and boys who use the toilet are far less important than the women, and must go to the toilet with all these horrible rapists and deviants (who are all men of course!). It is simply discrimination and fear mongering.","\"Well, I was about to molest that little girl, but, golly, I can't enter that bathroom because it's got a women only sign. Darn, guess I'll just go home then.\"","Agreed.\n\nFor the sake of argument and using the logic of the support, I suppose you could then say that anyone who wasn't obeying the placards was then willfully seeking to cause harm and could be reported for such. There would be no ambiguity as to whether or not someone who didn't fit the gender assignment was there to do their business or were acting as predators and would make the punishment of said individuals easier.\n\nWhile I can't speak for the validity of that argument, I have a hard time supporting it even if it were true because the laws themselves are still discriminatory. I am sure you could make similar arguments in support of any segregation law but it is very much an end justifies the means statement.\n\nI really do try my best to understand both sides in things like this but I don't see how there can be any legal support for the laws and the logic used to justify them seems shaky at best.","You can't find anything, because there's nothing to find.

","Which sucks for the people in the same religion who believes that homosexuality or being a transgender has nothing to do with getting to heaven or going to hell.

When in reality I'm bi and still feel like I serve God as much as they claim to. Christians who aren't understanding of any walk of life is not a true Christian.

I am glad it sounds like most of the people in your life were supportive though.","&gt; there are many accepting, loving churches out there that have no problem with gay or trans people\n\nJust like with the \"angry Muslim\" pictures in the news, we never hear of the good ones.","That's why I put at the end with not everyone is unaccepting at church.

You're black but I still accept you, despite your sinfulness by virtue of being black.\"\n\nFuck this \"love the sinner\" shit. It dodges the more fundamental question of what the hell I'd wrong with being gay or trans in the first place. The answer is nothing. Nothing except it's written in some piece of shit book that's full of contradictions and incorrect \"facts\" and was written by a bunch of primitives over a thousand years ago who assert magic without a shred of evidence. That's a great basis for your life's philosophy and for judging people as sinful, you dicks.","You do realize that everyone is a sinner by the rules of Christianity right? And that there has been only a single person in the entirety of Christian history that has been completely pure of sin, and he was the embodiment of God. It's practically impossible for someone to not have sinned. ","I thought Mary was the only human who didn't sin. Hence why she was chosen by God. Jesus did sin from my recollection of what I was taught - once as a child and once as an adult. Showing that he was human in a way. However I stopped going to church when I was about 12 so I may be wrong. ","Christianity is about accepting someone regardless of their sins. Its not about redefining sin. When Jesus talked to the prostitute at the well, he accepted her and broke many social stigmas even talking to her. That didn't change the fact that she was a dinner. Jesus told her she was forgiven and to go and sin no more he didn't tell her that prostitution was okay now that she believed he was the Messiah.     He loved the winner and not the sin. When the woman who was caught in prostitution was about to be stoned, Jesus free a line in the sand and told the people, if anyone of you is without sin, cast the first stone.  They dropped their rocks and went home. He told the woman that her sins were forgiven, not that they were okay or that society should change their views about her sins. \n\nThe Bible (in no the the old a new testaments says that sexual immorality -including homosexuality - is a sin. Nowhere does it say that we as Christians are to hate homosexuals. Anyone who believes that is wrong and find a new church and teacher. \n\nMy daughter is a lesbian and my son is bi-sexual. I love them both dearly and just like Jesus I would die for them. I pray every day for them. It doesn't make their sin right, but I'm a dinner too so who am I to judge?  That's not my job. My job is to live and to spread the gospel. ","&gt; At least we can be comforted by the fact that one day we will die and this whole bad joke of a life will be over.\n\nWell, that escalated quickly.","I'm thankful of death, its the one constant thing protecting the human race from the bad guys, the great equalizer. It doesn't matter how much good or bad you do to the world, eventually you will go away, and someone else gets to take a crack at things.","Me neither. I had an employee transition and some of the other employees lost their minds over it.

","While I'm totally on the side of trans people about this, I can see why people care so much. It's the same reason so many people fought (and are still fighting) gay marriage. It didn't really affect them, no matter how many times they say it does. They mostly argued against it for their perceived moral reasons. Just because a law doesn't affect you personally, doesn't mean you can't object to it. \n\nThink about dog fighting. This doesn't directly affect you, but you still think it should be illegal, right? Same vein of reason for this issue. \n\nI think they're totally wrong however, and I think that history will show that. I want gender neutral bathrooms everywhere.

Being trans is not a desire to wear clothing of the 'opposite' gender (that is a desire for many), it is a deep, very real acknowledgment that the person's gender identity does not match who they are mentally, how they perceive themselves.  It is such a hard thing to deal with and this lady sure doesn't help.  My closest friend is trans and I've gone through the journey of dealing with this for the past ten years with him, from realizing what was going on through transition, there for his surgeries, etc.  It has been an amazing journey with him and I have learned so much.

It isn't about dressing as someone you aren't, and becoming that person. \n\nIt's about a mis-match between you physical attributes and your gender identity. Taking on the physical or cultural attributes of your actual gender does not change who you are, but expresses who you really are. ","It's sadly a commonly perpetuated argument as support for discrimination against transgender people. There is evidence that suggests that typical transgenderism arises due to biological causation, specifically structural differences in the brain. It is precisely expressing who you are, in the same way that gay people are expressing who they are, not making a choice to become something due to some sort of weird desire. I think the biggest problem is the lack of understanding of the science behind being transgender. In most cases trans people cannot explain their feelings adequately enough and have no knowledge of research that can back up their feelings. They just try to describe conceptual feelings and often fall short of articulating them effectively. It is very easy to fear or hate something that is poorly understood, particularly when there are physical differences involved. Just like how people who were born with abnormalities used to be considered \"freaks\".","Not a troll, honest question.

Not kilts.","I'm pretty sure there's nothing encoded in our sex chromosomes saying that men's legs must be confined to two cloth cylinders while women's must be be confined to one. Gendered clothing is entirely cultural. Genders are just these boxes that we've put certain character traits, colors, behaviors, and other things into. The reality is that most people don't cleanly fit into either of them. We just have the \"correct\" behavior for the gender most commonly associated with our sex reinforced by society and the \"wrong\" ones punished with social rejection. We subconsciously learn over time (starting from birth really) which traits to amplify and which to suppress. It's just part of our social development in this culture. It's not wrong or right, it just is.\n\nEdit: Also, that reinforcement comes in many forms. It's in the adjectives used to describe us as babies and children, and the activities we're pushed to do by our parents and teachers. It's also in the toys we're bought and the careers we're told we'd do well in. A study was actually done where the same baby was dressed in both pink and blue clothes, and they asked people to assign personality traits to the baby based on appearance, without actually mentioning it's gender. Unsurprisingly, people assigned traits like \"strong\" and \"handsome\" when the baby was in blue, and used words like \"gentle\" and \"beautiful\" when it was in pink.","And not long ago, pink was the color for baby boys and blue was the color for girls. Boys wore dresses during childhood as well. It's meaningless.","&gt;I'm pretty sure there's nothing encoded in our sex chromosomes saying that men's legs must be confined to two cloth cylinders while women's must be be confined to one.\n\nPerhaps not, but there is something that determines our sexual attraction. The type of clothing we wear certainly factors into that. A man wearing a box tells our brain nothing about what he looks like under it. A man in a form-fitting suit gives us much information about that human's build, his muscles, his height, etc. These are all biological traits that humans, through evolution, have come to favor. As it so happens, men and women are biologically different. Most men have male reproductive organs and most women have female reproductive organs. Most men have XX chromosomes and most women have XY chromosomes. So it follows that there are certain things that make men attractive and certain other things that make women attractive. As for gender, most males identify as male and most females identify as female. This is where I suppose cultures that feature clothing heavily also have different clothing for men and women.","That's totally understandable, and you do have a point. However, I know many straight guys who love how girls look in tight-fitting jeans. I'd argue that the popularity of dresses also comes from historically conservative value systems in which being too sexually revealing is frowned upon, especially for women.","Yeah, I would agree with that. I think a lot of \"cultural norms\" and \"traditions\" we think of today are really just a result of patriarchy, and/or/aka religion.","This has not always historically been the case.","What's your point? Togas and kilts have nothing to do with the fact that dresses today are primarily worn by women.","My point is that these are arbitrary trends that can and do change.","No, you were told they were. It's just fabric with holes in it. ","If dresses are just fabric with holes in it then my money is just paper with ink on them","That is, in fact, exactly what your money is.

In that sense, gender dysphoria and being trans in general is not at all a psychological condition, but rather a physiological condition that is best treated through aligning the body with the brain (in other words, to align their sex with their gender).\n\n&gt;this does not make them any more the opposite sex than when they started.\n\nI disagree. I don't think it makes them 100% the opposite, but definitely more than prior to transitioning. \"Sex\" is defined through multiple characteristics: hormone levels (testosterone or estrogen), genitals, gonads, chromosomes, and secondary sex characteristics. Trans people can switch out 3 of the 5.\n\n","&gt;Gender roles are a social construct (at least in part)\n\nNo... according to feminists, gender itself is a social construct. (as a separate entity from sex)  In reality there is no grounds for such a distinction.  Gender is a language concept that attributes sex attributes to words in some languages.  It was never intended to describe people.\n\n&gt;gender identity, which, given the available scientific evidence, is likely neurological (ie, has to do with how our brains are wired)\n\nThis is correct.  However in this context, gender is used as a synonym for sex.\n\n&gt;In that sense, gender dysphoria and being trans in general is not at all a psychological condition, but rather a physiological condition that is best treated through aligning the body with the brain (in other words, to align their sex with their gender).\n\nCitation needed.  Physiological causes are suspected as a factor but no conclusive evidence for this exists.  Pre-natal testosterone is another possible factor.  However... nobody who understands these things would say that the largest single component isn't psychological.\n\n&gt;\"Sex\" is defined through multiple characteristics\n\nWrong.  Sex is determined genetically.  Altering hormone levels and outer appearance does nothing to change sex.  It does however as you said, bring the body more in line with psychological identity.","&gt; No... according to feminists, gender itself is a social construct.\n\nFeminists come from so many different camps that I don't think you can say that feminists in general hold this particular idea. Again, \"gender\" can be confusing because you don't always know whether the person means gender roles or gender identity, but when discussing trans issues, it's typically meant to be the latter. When discussing feminist issues, it's often used to mean the former. Gender roles and gender identity are two separate things, to be clear, given how many masculine women and feminine men there are.\n\n&gt; This is correct. However in this context, gender is used as a synonym for sex\n\n?\n\n&gt; Physiological causes are suspected as a factor but no conclusive evidence for this exists\n\nI never claimed it's conclusive, but the evidence is piling up. There's evidence that trans people have brain structures more similar to their identified gender than to their birth sex, that being transgender correlates with hormonal conditions (for example, being trans is virtually unheard of in XY women who have CAIS, a condition where the body doesn't respond to testosterone, and it's more common among biological females with PCOS, a condition that raises testosterone levels), there's evidence that trans people might have the brain mapping of the opposite sex and as a result show things like \"phantom penis syndrome\", and there's evidence that being trans might have a genetic component. \n\n&gt; Sex is determined genetically\n\nDoes that mean that [a male has given birth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2190741/)?","&gt;Feminists come from so many different camps that I don't think you can say that feminists in general hold this particular idea.\n\nGender as a social construct is an **axiom** of feminism.  Meaning that feminism could not exist if they conceded that men and women are biologically different and that we have different abilities relative to each other.\n\nIn other words... if you throw out \"gender as a social construct\" then no other feminist theories would even make sense.  It's literally the entire foundation of feminism.\n\n&gt;Gender roles and gender identity are two separate things, to be clear, given how many masculine women and feminine men there are.\n\nNo they aren't.  First and foremost, gender is an inappropriate term to describe people.  It implies that somehow gender is separate from sex... which is ridiculous.  Gender when used as feminists use it... purely describes gender roles adopted by someone.  So when someone says that their \"gender\" is fluid... they are saying that sometimes they take on opposing gender roles.  When they say that their gender is \"demiboy\" they are saying... I'm uncomfortable with female gender roles so I act like a boy.\n\nNone of this is meaningful biologically and is really just meaningless in general... other than to say... some people reject traditional gender roles.\n\n&gt;being trans is virtually unheard of in XY women who have CAIS\n\nXY Genotype is male regardless of a particular disorder.  If they choose to identify as women, then so be it.... but understand that these are men identifying as women (and probably due to not having any male characteristics.)  So yes, it would make sense that someone who is already identifying as the opposite gender... **does in fact have gender identity disorder**.  However, in this case... since they lack male characteristics, nobody would call it an identity disorder.\n\n&gt;Does that mean that a male has given birth?\n\nGotta love that you use extremely rare genetic disorders as red herrings to cloud the issue.  It's a sign of someone that really has good arguments.","Your style of argument is interesting also :)   but that's not the point.   \n\n&gt; Gender as a social construct is an axiom of feminism\n\nI don't think this is as true as you think, although maybe for select feminists it is.  \n\nMy understanding is that feminism is primarily about equality in treatment and opportunity - not about claiming the sexes are identical (psychologically, physically or otherwise).  I have heard feminists say similar things to what you claim, but, much like when you asked for a citation somewhere else, at the moment  your position on axioms and founding principles are unsubstantiated assertions. \n\nOften 'feminine' traits (whether biological or social) are devalued, and 'masculine' traits are favoured, both of which can be harmful to persons of either sex; redressing the many flow-on effects of this is one goal of modern feminism. ","I don't want to be that guy but imho egalitarianism is about equality. Feminism is about women's rights, MRA is about men's rights.\n\nYou can be a feminist who also has egalitarian values, but you're kidding yourself if you think the majority of feminists care whether or not I'm able to get custody of my kids. Similarly to MRAs caring about the portrayal of women in the media. They're both only playing one of the angles, and they refuse to talk to each other.\n\nA constant source of frustration for everyone with their head outside of their ass.","things can be more than one thing - feminism is a subset of egalitarianism that focuses on women's issues.\n\nAlso, I think its very hard to say what the 'majority' of feminists care about.  I think that when we see opinion pieces, protests, rallies, reddit posts by radical feminists etc. they are the loud minority; I know plenty of feminists who care that 'nurturing' is considered a feminine trait affecting custody issues.  ","&gt;things can be more than one thing - feminism is a subset of egalitarianism that focuses on women's issues.\n\nI simply can't reconcile this with the things I've seen and heard from self-identified feminists. Egalitarianism is a parralel concept to feminism, they might be going in the same direction sometimes but they're not connected. People who want women to be treated as equals will tend to be egalitarians because naturally (you would think) they would want equality across the genders and not just lobby for one, but far too often that's not the case. \n\nThat's kind of why MRAs exist, right? I mean if feminists were doing a stellar job at playing both sides there wouldn't be a desire to branch off and make their own movement. I don't subscribe to either feminism or meninism but I do think they kind of necessitate each other now that the greatest of our civil rights struggles seem to be behind us. \n\nSo yeah, if all feminists were egalitarians they'd be egalitarians and not feminists. It's just that egalitarianism isn't fun to say and doesn't have a movement behind it. Just my 2c","I don't think all feminists are egalitarians, and I don't think that feminists are doing a stellar job at representing both sides.\n\nThere is, however, a huge tendency to conflate the voices of the few with the views of the many.\n\nThere are definitely feminists who are anti-men, and anti-men's rights.  Once people start to form an opinion, confirmation bias starts to creep in and we end up with a situation in which people think that all feminists and feminism as a whole is well-represented  by the loud minority.\n\nIn my opinion, while men are certainly discriminated against, women are also, and in more impactful areas.  Women are more likely to get custody of children, more likely to get lighter sentencing in criminal hearings, can play the sympathy card more effectively in disciplinary settings.  Men own more land, have  more wealth, have more hiring and firing privileges, have greater ability to pass laws, and are far likely to be the victims of violent crime. \n\nFeminism exists not because men aren't discriminated against, nor because egalitarianism isn't fun to say; they exist because men have done a terrible job at advocating for women's rights, and on balance, women get a raw deal.\n\nIts sad to me that a few (or many) rotten eggs have turned so many people against what should be an obviously worthy cause.","&gt;I don't think this is as true as you think, although maybe for select feminists it is. \n\nEven suggesting anything contrary on a college campus would probably get you harassed and likely accused of some fake hate crime.  Seriously.  There is no other acceptable opinion among academics.\n\n&gt;My understanding is that feminism is primarily about equality in treatment and opportunity\n\nThis is a smokescreen used to gain the moral high ground.  In reality, feminists not only don't care about male issues but actively fight against anyone who wants to bring male issues into the public sphere.  \n\nIt is about equality as lip-service only.  The reality is that when men want to build a men's center on a campus (there are already women's centers)... there are protests and insane hyperbole about creating a misogynist environment that encourages \"violence\" against women.\n\nWhen women became a large majority on campuses (65% in the U.S.) and men wanted scholarships to help men get into schools... they were completely blocked by feminists.  Oh and no they won't be removing the female only scholarships.\n\nFeminism is not at all about equality.  It's about taking power away from men and giving it to feminists.  I have thousands of examples that show that not only are they not about equality... they actively intend on hurting men.\n\n&gt;Often 'feminine' traits (whether biological or social) are devalued, and 'masculine' traits are favoured\n\nUtter nonsense.

For example, there's at least one documented case of a woman with xy sex chromosomes who developed her entire life as a woman physically, and gave birth to 3 children naturally, including a daughter who also had xy chromosomes.

Both men and women adopt ***cultural*** behaviours (.e.g. wearing certain types of clothes, participating in certain hobbies/past-times, etc).\n\nNobody is trying to state that a person with a penis wearing a dress somehow makes them have a vagina. What they're saying is that, within the culturally dominated gender identities that exist, a person with a penis wearing a dress may be trying to fit into the female dichotomy and, thus, want to identify as what we call female.\n\nSex is biological, but I think it's arcaic to conflate sex with gender because there is so much more to how we identify as male/female than just our genitalia -- there's a whole host of learned behaviours. It might feel unintuitive and against what we've always learned to be true, but I think that's where social discourse is heading -- we need to accommodate wider ideas of identity.\n\nExtra comment: Though I would like to say wearing a dress =/= female. If a man wants to wear a dress (irrespective of if they are a man with a penis or vagina), they aren't necessarily female. It depends what they feel they are.

","You just said men don't want to hear women shitting.\n\nSo why allow a woman into the men's washroom where they would hear her shitting?","But look at why a person would do that.

I \"feel comfortable as a woman\" I am now going to use the woman's changing room at my gym and you can't do anything about it, because that's discrimination.

Nice try though.","Sorry your either xx or xy, other than that it's a mental condition. ","Actually both of those are false. There are people with XXY and other such chromosomes. On top of that, XX/XY don't necessarily dictate whether you develop as male/female.

The only issue I would have with the bathroom use is the sexual predators that would use this to their advantage. Dress up as a woman and watch the restroom. When a suitable target enters they also enter and no one would question it because they are allowed to even though they are actually a man. If no one thinks this will happen they are naive. \nAdded note: It happens now, how much more will it happen when the laws are changed? Google Christopher Hambrook, Taylor J. Buehler, Norwood Smith Burnes and Jason Pomare. ","Do you know of any occasion where that has happened? I can't really find any in google.\n\nDo you really think that a law change will stop it from happening?

Check back again in a few years when it is accepted everywhere.

Now everyone would just treat it as an everyday normal occurrence. There WILL be people that use this to their advantage. Will it be an everyday occurrence? Probably not. I know that keeping cross dressers out of the ladies room won't stop sex offenders but why give them an easy avenue?","because trans people have rights","In North Carolina, the law is that trans people have to use the bathroom that matches their biological sex. As in, trans men -- who often look indistinguishable from other men, even without any surgery -- have to use the women's. So, if men pretending to be trans to gain access to the women's bathroom is what you're afraid of, what's stopping a man from pretending to be FTM trans? And he wouldn't even have to put on a dress to do it, he could just walk in as is and claim that he was born female and so has to use this bathroom. \n\nPeople always discuss this involving a man pretending to be MTF; I don't understand why it's not considered the other way.","but cant predators do that anyway?","Yes it can and does happen but it would happen more. How many have been thwarted because someone told them they don't belong in the women's room when they are entering. That won't happen when they have a right to enter, even if it under false pretense.","I think a lot of the problems lately have been coming from problems with transgender or cross dressing men using public restrooms of their choice, and also the moral dilemma of trans kids. Most people don't care too much if its just you doing your thing, but when other people or their children are brought into the equation, conflict generally ensues. ","I identify as a pirate. But I download anime from filesharing sites, so I think that counts.","I don't think a cross dressing man should go into a women's restroom and make my daughter or other women uncomfortable.

But I don't believe this bathroom issue is the real reason people don't like trans people. I think it's used to disguise peoples prejudices. Everyone knows someone who was sexually harassed. Everyone knows someone who was mugged. I don't even know someone who knows someone who had an issue with sharing a bathroom with a trans person.\n\nThere was a lady who made a video of herself walking around new york, constantly getting pestered by men.

Then there is the issue of how men will feel about trans people sharing the same bathroom as them.

","yeah, i know, and i'm pretty sure that that lady is against trans people, gay people, black people, white people and such, but that doesn't mean we should take it like this, especially because we don't know for sure. this is the stuff that gives this people more power, they are ignorant and the supporters are too, so this is going to be a long battle because no one is willing to agree with the other. no one has to be 100% right and the other one 0%, like the \"suporters\" call it, it is more nuanced. ( i hate this people that today are for gay rights and then trans rights and so on but they don't give a shit about it, just run their mouths from the back of a keyboard and just poke at the people that are against it, and they don't do nothing except making a joke about everything, like this otherkin shit or stuff like that. let me tell you a story, i have 3 gay friends that know each other, and 2 of them are sassy as fuck, and i didn't like them one bit. and then i've seen the modern family sitcom and i really like the flaming gay guy, and i told this other gay friend and he told me, of curse you like that guy, he's likable, this ones aren't a bit, it's not your fault that you don't like them. that was an eye opening thing for me, because i thought i don't like sassy gay people, but in fact, my friends were not likable. if you have this war against people who hate someone, better explain them why they aren't doing right and maybe what is wrong with \"your side\", it helps, like those people who say that they don't like cats and then you show them one, and they fall in love with it) \n\n\nit's enough hate in this world, hate and greed is all you see, why make it a hateful thing when someone hates someone. fight hate with love. ","That's a good point. There is no 100% correct answer.","No offense, I'm actually really liberal and I think people should have the right to do anything they want but that's the dumbest argument anyone can make.  If you have a dick you're not a woman, and just because someone has gender dysphoria doesn't make their feelings a reality.  \n\nIt's good to be tolerant and accepting but at the end of the day male and female have a specific definition.  If you're talking gender identity and not sex then okay.  But again, gender identities are basically feelings and don't really reflect what you actually are in the real world.  Although if you want to identify as the opposite sex then you should definitely be allowed to.   \n\n","Surely how someone identifies is more important that what their genes say? Modern medicine allows people who identify as a different gender to transition to be (mostly) like their choice of gender, what is wrong with that?","thats \"sex\" though, people have bastardised gender so they can say theyre male/female/foxkin or whatever\n\nso sex? you are what you were born as, gender? say whatever u like","Yeah,  that's what I was getting at.  Mostly the part in ops post about how wearing a dress doesn't make someone a woman.  Well okay, neither does feeling like they're a woman.  If they want to be treated like a woman that's cool, but at the end of the day they're a man with gender dysphoria who feels like (identifies as) a woman.  \n\n*Being* a woman has everything to do with what they were born with.  *being* *accepted* as a woman or being treated like a woman, however someone wants to say it, has more to do with acceptance of how people feel.\n\nI feel like understanding all this is important because we have to be realistic to get anywhere with a push for equal rights.  It's not going to work if we're being disingenuous and presenting feelings as facts. \n\n","I think you're a bit muddled actually. No trans person is denying how they were born. Genetically, aside from intersex cases, if we look at chromosomes we can see what sex someone was born as. No-one is denying that. But there are lots of studies which highlight biological causation for typical transgenderism. Such studies highlight specific brain differences even before any sort of treatment, showing that trans brains are indeed structurally different. So when we talk about \"biology\" and \"how someone is born\" we need to be careful. We should define people based upon their being, their brain, not their physical abnormalities or physicality in general. I think this is a very important point to understand, one that very few people realise.","I'd disagree with you, plenty of people have brains that work differently.

Whether the brain lines up with male brains or female brains. There is indeed a difference.\n\nMale brains react negatively in the abundance of estrogen and lack of androgens. Female brains react positively in such. There's other differences as well.\n\n[Check it out.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=medium&amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0083947.g003) \"Patients\" in this case are trans people listed by their sex assigned at birth.

Or just most?","Like anything having to do with biology, I'm referring to the average. The reality is that brains are largely gender/sex neutral and have parts that correlate with the brains of most males or parts that correlate with the brains of most females.\n\nTrans people have brains that match their gender identity, rather than their assigned sex at birth.\n\nThat is, on the image I linked, cis and trans guys match the controls 'm' while cis and trans girls match the controls 'f'.\n\nObviously in practice/reality, there can be more variance and some outliers.\n\nBy male I mean: the average of most individuals that we label male. And by female I mean: the average of most individuals that we label female.","So a male who does not have an 'average' brain is a female? And vice versa?  That seems a bit extreme.  Why cant they just be an unaverage male.  Most people would fit this description.","&gt;So a male who does not have an 'average' brain is a female? \n\nDepends on which way it's not average. I'm speaking more about the gender/sex differences noted in the brain. I'd say yea, if your brain matches that of females rather than that of males, then you'd be more appropriately labeled as female. I'd wager you suffer from some sort of gender dysphoria as well and would be better off going through hormone replacement therapy.\n\n&gt;Why cant they just be an unaverage male. Most people would fit this description.\n\nActually, most people would fall in line in the areas we're talking about. That's sort of the point. Trans people are unusual in this factor. Their brain falls under the gender/sex that they identify as. Which is what we'd expect if trans was a legit thing. If it wasn't (and trans people were just making stuff up), it'd line up with their birth sex (which it doesn't).\n\nAnd again, we can clearly see the effects of cross hormone therapy on cisgender individuals. It leads to gender dysphoria, much like how a trans person reacts to their birth sex hormones.\n\nI'd be entirely comfortable saying that if you get gender dysphoria from male (testosterone/androgens) hormones, line up with female brains on most of the sexed differences, and relieve gender dysphoria upon getting female (estrogen) hormones, that you are indeed mentally female and have a female sexed brain.\n\nObviously, when I say 'average', I'm referring to the average brain of those we label male, and the average brain of those we label female and the noticeable difference between the two. Obviously in other factors, brains may differ, but not noticeably between the two sexes, which is my point.","Too true.

Essentially, gay people are sinners simply for existing.  That's different than somebody sinning as an act, like two straight people having premarital sex.  That act is an isolated incident, not an identity.\n\nSecond, homosexuality is not something somebody can change.  We can learn to not be covetous.  But we can't learn to like vaginas when we like dicks... just like straight dudes would agree that there's no way you could convince them to like cock.\n\nI think those are the two important problems that non-christians have with the belief that homosexuality is a sin.","most of the time ","Seen plenty of porn stars wearing them...","&gt; Imagine if Christians still saw being black as the mark of Cain and a sign of sin.\n\nWe don't have to imagine.

If there's no mental gender, how do you account for that? Hormones literally have opposite effects on trans and cis people. David Reimer demonstrates that clearly.\n\nEither way, I have to agree that mental gender really doesn't have anything to do with anything besides mind/body relations.

Gender is whether you're mentally male or female, sex is whether you're biologically male or female.\n\n\nIn a trans person they don't match up.

So they take steps to make the outside match the inside.","I don't recognize gender as an actual thing. It is just a term people made up to identify themselves.

So it's not apparent or noticeable. Stick that brain in a female body and you'd be noticing it.\n\nBut you're right, in a way. Male/Female *are* just terms we use to label certain configurations of people. And indeed anyone can just go and claim to be male/female with no real backing. But to say that it's not a thing is silly.","Except that isn't 100% true. There are a lot of corner cases where genetics and physiology don't agree. You have people who have XY genetics but either don't produce or respond to testosterone and thus never develop a penis.\n\nTake Sawyer's Syndrome for an example. These kids are XY genetically, but they develop as female in utero. Generally the first time that have any indication that they are genetically male is when they don't go through puberty. A doctor investigates and realizes they are XY, and don't have ovaries, despite having a vagina and uterus, they may or may not have vestigial testes imbedded in the back of their vaginal wall. Such people generally \"identify\" as girls. And usually they'll be given estrogen, go through a female puberty, and continue through life as women. Some can even carry babies to term after being implanted with doner eggs. \n\nAnd that is only one type of intersexuality. There or dozens of others, including some where people aren't entirely genetically female or male. XY and XX aren't the only generic genders. You also have XXY and XXX. Neither gender nor sex are exactly binary. And that's only considering physiology and genetics. Things like natural hormone imbalances can muddy the waters even further.\n\nNow that we are able to do some basic brain mapping, we're also learning that there are actual some structural difference between the brains of men and women. [Some studies](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/) are beginning to show that transgendered brains tend to more closely resemble the brains of the gender they identify as, rather than the brain that matches their genetic or physiological sex. That is to say a male-to-female transgender person may quite literally have a female brain inside a male body, just like a person with Sawyer's may have male genetics inside a female physiology.\n\nThe more we learn about sex and gender, the more we increasingly see that there isn't any way to uniquely identify sex or gender with 100% accuracy. For most of us both sex and gender is a binary. And for most of us they agree. But for a small portion of the population they don't agree and/or aren't binary. For me it's important to recognize and protect that portion of the population. ","I'm well aware of cases like what you presented, but in those rare instances there is an exception and maybe they should be labeled in a different way.

Feminists originally were looking for equality of opportunity.  Conventional wisdom was that men were better at some things than women and so were not really taken seriously in male fields.\n\nTo combat this, feminists invented the notion that sex and gender are two different things and that gender was a result of socialization, but that men and women were both equally as capable.  This was rejected by science because science can clearly demonstrate consistent cognitive and ability differences between men and women.\n\nSo feminists merely decided that science was sexist, ignored the evidence and kept developing their gender-as-a-social-construct \"theory\" in the humanities where they would go unchallenged by the hard sciences. (quotes around theory because in the humanities, a theory does not require evidence, is never tested, and cannot make useful predictions)\n\nFast forward 30 years... by now feminists had built a small mountain of theories based on this majorly flawed premise.  Intersectional feminism became a thing and gave birth to social justice... which at its core is repackaged anti-white anti-male racism and sexism.\n\nWhite people, to avoid being discriminated against... as privileged, began creating all kinds of alternate genders and sexual orientations so that they could join in being part of the \"oppressed class\".\n\ntl,dr - gender is nonsense based on a deeply flawed premise that has been debunked by the hard sciences many times over.","I like the cut of your jib","I prefer it to uncut jib myself.","Exactly.

They dont agree with the lifestyle and will continually point that out *because* they care for that person and think it is saving them from eternal suffering.

","I'm not getting how any of that is relevant to the point that the girl in OP's picture is NOT being accepting, and is going out of her way to hurt, which is against the ideals of Christianity. I'm not even debating whether the ideal Christian is still right or wrong, I'm saying that this girl is NOT an ideal Christian. \n\nAlso, \n\n&gt;They accept them as a person and a human being who is making a mistake. They accept them as a friend, family member, but they do not accept or agree with their lifestyle.\n\nI don't see how this is an issue. I am not accepting or agreeing of the lifestyle of drug users, but I still accept them as friends, family members or whatever. I fully think they're making a mistake. But that doesn't mean I'm going out of my way to ruin their lives either. And much like gays, trans and others like that, drug users can't help that they want and desire the drugs they abuse. ","Okay first off lets stop being dramatic. This picture is not hurtful or ruining anyones lives. Second off we still have no idea if she is a Christian, so her being an ideal one is not relevant to the discussion. \n\n\nTo the topic. In her mind she is asking a legitimate question. Its actually more scientific in nature, since science is to question things. \n\n\nYou wouldnt go out of your way to try to get help or disagree with a close family member that is dangerously addicted to crack or cocaine? ","&gt; This picture is not hurtful\n\nI very much disagree. This kind of picture is exactly the kind of thing that would wear a trans person out and be a part of something that could push a trans person to suicide. In fact, I'd go as far as say that this kind of thing is the reason why most trans people who commit suicide end up committing suicide. The lack of acceptance from others. \n\n&gt;Second off we still have no idea if she is a Christian, so her being an ideal one is not relevant to the discussion.\n\nI think you need to review the parent comments then, because it went from \"how can someone do this?\" to someone using religion to explain how, to me pointing out the irony that the likely religion of OP, if she was religious, would ideally be more accepting, and then our conversation. So yes, it's very much relevant to the discussion. \n\n&gt;In her mind she is asking a legitimate question. Its actually more scientific in nature, since science is to question things.\n\nOh please, we know full well what her actual implication is. \n\n&gt;You wouldnt go out of your way to try to get help or disagree with a close family member that is dangerously addicted to crack or cocaine?\n\nYea, but that's hardly relevant. I'd try to HELP the person, not be demeaning to the person by posting petty pictures on social media. ","Again with the dramitic response. No one is being insulted.  She is asking how putting on a dress makes you a woman. I am actually suprised you are not confused with you dramitic outrage. Why stop at trans people. Are feminists going to be the next to be outraged at this? Since when was a dress girls clothing. \n\n\nYou cannot force other people to accept different lifestyles. I also doubt any trans people were harmed in the making of this picture. So again I fail to see how this makes someone commit suicide. If anything their depression is self inflicted from their treatment. This picture is about as harmful as a barebacked toothless, crippled mouse. I will not continue this conversation if you keep going full hyperbole on me. Its exhausting and laughable at best. \n\n\n\nAs far as the religion goes this went from, *you* doing all of that, to me telling you that you dont understand christianity, to us having our own discussion. So again the parent comment is irrelevant since we are having our own conversation. Not continuing yours. \n\n\n\nEven if she was a christian, again this doesnt make her less of one. She isnt insulting anyone, she isnt calling anyone names. She is questioning how putting on a dress makes you a woman, which again must be very confusing outrage i would assume. Kinda makes me wonder if you support feminism. Are you against women being able to wear and do what they want?\n\n\n&gt; Oh please, we know full well what her actual implication is.\n\n\nSorry this will be the only thing I quote. Im on mobile and proper formatting is a pain in the ass. \n\n\nWe dont know what the implication is, in fact I can see a few different ones myself. Can you enlighten me to what she is implying? \n\n\nTo your final point, unless there is a man hidden in the dress that I cannot see, I dont see a picture of anyone being condemned or made fun of. I just see an empty dress. No one is being made fun of. (Aside the lady in the shitty pirate outfit. Worst looking sexy pirate I have ever seen.)","Nope, accepting Jesus Christ does though :)","I remember in high school, this *holier than thou* dude starts ranting about how if you're gay you're not born gay and this and that.

Just because you FEEL a certain way(truly and wholly and 100% believe in it) doesn't make it right(it doesn't make it wrong either). If I just FEEL like doing this or doing that, that doesn't mean I should do it. Can I? Yeah, especially if it doesn't harm anyone. I have never met a trans person, I wouldn't be against it, and I don't see why people are so upset about it, they don't harm anyone personally by choosing to change genders. I just disagree with the sense of entitlement that just because I 100% believe in something that it's right. ","There have been trans people forever, it's just more open and talked about now.

Science said the universe was static, phrenology was real, the earth was flat and that you would explode in space. None of this disproves your science, but it does give wiggle room to idea that science shouldn't be taken as concrete evidence for everything. In fact, saying \"science says they're right\" just takes the entitlement they exhibit and piggy backs it onto a study. I'm not a neurologists so I have no right to put input in on what studies do and don't show. But I will say, that while I'm not against equality for trans people, I'm okay with people who are. That's the problem with tolerance and it's posse, everyone wants it for what THEY truly believe. They are so against the idea of someone having the right to hate trans people, that in practicing tolerance for trans, gay, whatever-the-fuck, they don't realize they're just as intolerant on the other side of the coin.","Whatever dude.

It'll still be a while before heads don't turn when a man wears a dress down the street, but I'm hopeful that that day is coming.\n\nI don't thin this will happen because dresses are specifically designed for women's bodies.  The breast part, but also the way dresses form to the torso...women have more pronounced waists.  Nicer legs.  If men wear dresses, they'd have to be more masculine looking and not so deliberately feminine as they currently are.  And this has happened...like in Ancient Rome.  That style of dress doesn't like feminine  Also kilts.  Same exact idea as a skirt, but doesn't try to flatter a woman's shape.\n\nPants for girls still look pretty different than man pants.

Interestingly, written at a highly transitional time for every single band member.  Nicks and Buckingham were in an extremely turbulent relationship which was coming to an end, John and Christine McVie had divorced and were barely speaking, and Fleetwood had just learned that his wife had been having an affair (to divorce soon afterwards).  I think it was the personal upheaval that caused them to put so much of themselves into each song.  Phenomenal album from start to finish.","if you listen to Go Your Own Way, its about the turbulent relationship that Nicks and Buckingham had.\n ","If I recall correctly Nicks began to hate Buckingham for the line\n\n\"Packing up, shacking up is all you wanna do\"\n\nHere's the exert from Wikipedia, it tells so much about the band at that time:\n\n\"Stevie Nicks asked Buckingham to remove the lyrics \"Packing up, shacking up is all you wanna do\", but Buckingham refused. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Nicks gave her thoughts on the matter. \"I very much resented him telling the world that 'packing up, shacking up' with different men was all I wanted to do. He knew it wasn't true. It was just an angry thing that he said. Every time those words would come onstage, I wanted to go over and kill him. He knew it, so he really pushed my buttons through that. It was like, 'I'll make you suffer for leaving me.' And I did.\"","The first three albums that ushered in the Buckingham Nicks Era of Fleetwood Mac were all truly astonishing.  Of those, Tusk is the one that really captures what I love most of this incarnation.  As far as \"The Chain\" goes, there is an incredible demo of this that has a slow instrumental build; highly recommended.","Holy shit, yes! Everyone likes to put Tusk down but I think it is truly some of their best songwriting especially for Stevie (even though the album was Lindsey's baby).","Big shout out for The Ledge, mainly because of its bonkers production: http://youtu.be/DuQFnVKrHuY\n\n","My 4 year old knows Tusk by the first bar and runs to the speaker!

I loved it so much I bought the DVD. It's such an amazing live performance.","Me too! I basically grew up on the live album. My parents had that on CD, but most of the others were on records and i wasn't allowed to use the record player as a kid. Listened to The Dance so much that I prefer the live versions of most of the songs now. The live version of this song might be my favorite from Fleetwood Mac altogether. ","How the hell is that audience sitting down during this performance. I'd be standing ON my seat. ","I was a teenager when The Dance first aired, I think on VH1, and it was the year I'd first learned to play guitar. I was into mostly metal and industrial at the time, but had an ear for classic rock too, so I'd heard of Fleetwood Mac but never really listened to them.\n\nI watched this and I was hooked from the intro of The Chain all the way through the end. I remember seeing this and Big Love later on in the show and thinking, \"How the hell does he do that?\" I learned about Travis picking and practiced for years until I could finally nail both of those songs. This live show and album completely changed my personal playing style as a musician, and definitely hooked me into a more eclectic musical fandom where I was willing to draw inspiration from anything.\n\nThanks for posting this! Lindsey will forever make my list as one of the greatest guitarists of all-time, and most definitely in the top of the list of most underrated guitarists of all time.\n\n[Big Love, from The Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZp76M4NGc)","The bass solo is amazing!","John in such an under appreciated genius. I think he is one of the best bass players of all time but I may be a tad bias since they're my favorite band.","Every bass player I've ever played with has whipped this one out at least once in rehearsal.","Their song [Rhiannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_aYibUx1B8) and their live rendition of [Landslide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK2HAfb3rC0) are also fantastic","I was so annoyed the other day when i went to listen to both of those songs only to find I don't have a copy of \"Fleetwood Mac\" on LP...\n\nThat album plus Rumours are fantastic. ","\"The Dance\" is one of the best live albums of all time.  \n\nI grew up on that album, many hours riding with my parents absolutely SCREAMING along to [Tusk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrRVW-p8SJ8).  I can't even imagine how badass it must have been in person to see Mick Fleetwood come back out on stage and start banging that shit out.\n\nEdit: [This was what they played next in case anyone was wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgwRYjDhK_E)\n\nAlso amazing: [From their 2003 show in Boston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dff2XCh3Ass)  - Solidified Lindsey Buckingham as one of the most badass dudes alive IMO.  (As if [40 years of such performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5kOzGwsHXw) didn't do that already)\n\nEdit 2: Fuck it, here's more Fleetwood Mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRu7Pt42x6Y","It is THE best concert video I've ever seen.  I believe Stevie described the concert as, \"As magic as it gets...it was.\" I tend to agree.  That whole performance is amazing.  ","They're both always amazing live as is Silver Springs (but especially on The Dance). Landslide is going to be my father-daughter dance song for my wedding in July. Had to incorporate The Mac in there somehow!! :)","If you are too cool for Fleetwood Mac, you might just be too cool.","Saw them in Perth last year whilst it was pouring down rain, was fantastic, thoroughly enjoyed it.","This has always been my favorite song. I heard it for the first time while camping with a bunch of hooligans. Great introduction to music.","This one is great, but my favorites are Never Going Back Again and Gold Dust Woman. ","If you like this, try the live version with the amazing looks between Nicks and Buckingham.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGykwC0fdJ4","Taking Dawn's cover is really good:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6PNZLehuGU","[Bonus - The (2) Chain(z)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtah3MqtdXU)\n\n(Fleetwood Mac &amp; 2 Chainz Mashup)","I was surprised by how good this cover version by Cody Frost on this year's UK the Voice was:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=18ViAP9rf_Y","Holy shit that was really good...","I came here to say the same thing. She did a cover version of an Abba song, and rearranged it, to the point I knew I had heard it before, but could not place it.

Gotta thank my grandad for getting me into Fleetwood Mac about a decade ago, still yet to seem them live because i got sick the day of the show near me on the last UK tour.","I remember being in the car with my Mom listening to this. ","I just got an old pressing of the rumours vinyl, just amazing when you listen straight through it. ","This is one of my girlfriends favourite songs to have a drink to. She told me this after I told her one of mine was Dreams. I lucked in.","My favorite Saturday afternoon jam. \n\nFleetwood Mac always gets me going. ","Good old Steamy Nicks.","to the day it reminds me of damon hill in his williams car in formula one,the bridge used to be the opening music of F1 on the BBC when i was a kid. ","favorite part of 2015 was randomly hearing this on the radio in a heavy rainstorm just driving down the 5 in California. ","I wish music like this was still in fashion ... M83 tried to use this type of vibe in their new album, but it fell a little flat.","I'm pretty sure The Pixies based their entire sound on the outro of this song.","Bummmm Bum Bum BUM Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bummmmmm","That guitar solo is so damn good.","Oh, god, I love this song. My favorite is definitely the version off The Dance, though. Actually, The Dance is probably my absolute favorite Fleetwood Mac album ever.   \n\nMy best friend and I used to listen to it constantly. Her wedding song was actually Big Love (the guitar work on that song is nothing short of incredible). I remember that her parents used to make fun of us constantly because it was more their generation’s music than ours.  ","I feel like posting any song off of Rumours in this subreddit is like cheating haha ","Not sure if someone has already mentioned this but for those of you who love the Rumours album and this song in particular, check out the super deluxe album release and the demo version of The Chain. It's much different--only Stevie; acoustic. The riff in what we now know as The Chain is featured in a song that Christine sang, called Keep Me There. ","That bass line tho ","I cannot stop listening to this song! Plus im a huge fan of 80's music, classic rock, 80's pop, generally any 80's music especially Fleetwood Mac!","It's amazing that this album came out in 77, at that!  Rumours was so ahead of its time for sure.  ","Fleetwood Mac has been my favorite band since I was 15 years old (now 28) and I was so amazingly fortunate to get to see them live about 3 years ago. Gah! They're just so amazing. I still enjoy the music they're putting out more recently but nothing compares to Rumours. It's an untouchable album imo.","I've been a fan since I was about 15, too, though I'm a few years older than you (wocka wocka). I often joke that my memorabilia collection is my kids' college fund, but it's a joke because I can't see myself selling anything (I specialize in artwork/photography and records - I've even got all the old bootleg albums from the 70s). I've seen Stevie solo 5 times, Lindsey solo once, and the Mac as a whole twice. Perfection every time. I even got Lindsey to sign my Tusk lithograph - next to Stevie's Rhiannon painting, it is my most prized piece.","I've collected all of their LPs (and some before Lindsey, Stevie, and Christine joined) and a few of the their old posters but besides that I only have current concert/fan shirts. I am completely blessed to have such a sweet fiance who got me Fleetwood Mac tickets for our first Christmas together 3 years ago (which he always says he set the bar too high lol) and it was literally one of the highlights of my life. As soon as they started to perform I immediately broke into tears because I thought I'd never get the chance to see them. Of course, Christine wasn't with them at that concert and she rejoined shortly after we saw them (which is a bummer since Songbird is one of my favorite songs) but it was still amazing and they went for around 3 1/2 hours!!","\"Oh Well\" is the only Fleetwood Mac song I ever liked. That bassline was fucking sick. The rest of their music reminds me of all the other soft rock they played at my orthodontist's office in the early '90s. ","That's because that was a completely different band. The original line up, fronted by Peter Green, with Danny Kirwan joining later, was outselling both the Stones and The Beatles. Check out \"Rattlesnake Shake\", and \"The Green Manalishi\"  from *Live in Boston* to listen to them in their prime. ","\"Man of the world\" is also absolutely sickening song","I can't believe that slipped my mind, it's one of my favourites!","The night is so black that the darkness cooks","**DUH DE DUH DE DUH, DUH DUH**","That makes a lot of sense. I never understood why a band capable of such awesomeness wiild spend decades being not very awesome. Thanks for the info.","No problem! \n\nThe reason for the change in line up was essentially Green leaving for disputed reasons, Jeremy Spencer running off to join a cult (Children of God in LA I believe), and Kirwan becoming an alcoholic and uncooperative. There was a period that straddled the pop and the blues iterations which featured Bob Welch and Weston also.","The reason for the change in line up was essentially Green leaving for disputed reasons.......\n\nThis makes me so sad, I believe if Green hadn't have took that trip he'd have been recognised as one of the best, some have all the technique but no emotion, the opening of \"need your love so bad\" gets me everytime, same  as \"I loved another woman\"\n\n\"He's the only one who gave me the cold sweats\" ","Fleetwood Mac was much better before they got the chicks. Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.","I like to just think of them as two separate, awesome groups that shared a common name.  Kinda the opposite of Jefferson Airplane/Starship","For the life of me, I will never understand how this sub works.","That's okay. You'll be okay.","Why have I never heard of this band? I've been listening to my local classic rock radio station for years and never once heard of them. \n\nPeople keep mentioning *Rhiannon*. If that song is by Fleetwood Mac, then it's the only song of theirs I know since the station plays it like 20 times a week.\n\nAnyone recommend any of their albums? Other than *Rumours*, it's been mentioned in this thread multiple times.","Rhiannon was on the Fleetwood Mac (self titled) album. It is by Fleetwood Mac.  I find it crazy you've never heard of Fleetwood Mac.  My guess would be, you've heard a lot more of them than you probably recognize.  I suggest their greatest hits album and work from there. \n","There was a great version on the UK voice this year. I'm too stupid to link it sorry ","Hands up all those who only listen to the part of the song they use in formula 1 towards the end coz that bit is awesome but the rest of the song is kinda \"meh\""],["Greatest day of my life was spent at the Hatch Shell with 100,000 other people listening to them play their \"farewell\" concert.","Even though Chad forgot the words to the second verse -__- lol\n\nI was there too!","Me three! Awesome show/experience. It doesn't feel that long ago but I also remember it being the day after the first Boston MySpace party (yeah that was a thing) which makes me realise it was a long time ago now.","\"Hold on now fellas back it up for a minute...\" As a then-14 year-old obsessed with Dispatch, going to that show was pretty much the greatest day of my life. Good times","The water bottle fight was one of the most cool things I've seen in person.","That's right! I have a great pic of that. A couple idiots threw glass though and some people went to the hospital. ","One of those bands that are great in the studio, but just phenomenal live. So happy they have a lot of their discography on the live albums they've released.","Not sure if you've listened to the newest live release (Ain't No Trip to Cleveland) but it fully lives up to their (very high) standards. Love the live versions of their newer songs.","I have and I fully agree. Actually made a pretty lengthy trip to Chicago to see them live shortly after Ain't No Trip to Cleveland was released because I was so into it.","Greatest day of my life was when they came back and played at Red Rocks. Holy guacamole, what a show. ","I was there as well. Absolutely insane show. ","Me too! Drove from Southern California for it - it was out of this world.","I remember that concert well. It was the summer after my senior year in high school. I remember getting close to the concert, hearing all the people, but couldn't see them because it was at the top of a hill. I remember getting to the top of the hill and looking out at a sea of people and just thinking \"woaaah.\"\n\nI was with some buddies and a few girls. One of the girls, who was a little overweight asked me to put her on my shoulders. I remember in my head thinking... really? Is she serious? I tried. I toughed it out as long as I could. I think I lasted 3 minutes before my legs starting shaking and sweat was profusely pouring out of me.\n\n\nI also remember people started throwing bottles. And I mean everywhere. Just bottles flying like crazy. Even glass bottles here and there which freaked me out. They almost stopped the show like 3 times cause of it.\n\nGood show. We all thought they were kidding about retiring, but figured it was the perfect excuse for a road trip. I mean who spends so many years building up an audience. Living out of your van for years and years doing any and every show possible. And when the fruits of your efforts start to finally pay off and you are hitting it big. Boom, retire. Didn't make sense. Anyways, good show, awesome band, still in regular rotation on my pandora stations. K, I'm done.

I felt as if I were given permission to forgive myself.

I hadn't really paid attention to the lyrics at first, I just knew it made me feel nostalgic and happy. One time singing along, it registered what I was saying. The Flying Horses holds such a special place in my heart and memories, and every time I visited as a kid I wanted to take a ring SO BAD but never had the nerve. Instead, winning the brass ring made me feel like I had my own for just a moment.

Although it was primarily based on the Civil War, the message was not confined to that particular conflict. The song tells about General Robert E. Lee telling his Confederate army to basically go home and stop fighting. We were too young to be directly involved in the Gulf War; nevertheless, the sense of a troubled history rings loud in the heads of young men who grow up listening to grandfathers or fathers recount war stories. The crowd response to this song always blew us away. Some said it had a \"Castles Made of Sand\" feel - any reference to Hendrix we took gladly.\nWe recorded the song up in the northeast kingdom on borrowed instruments. Our hazy-eyed hairball engineer swayed like a derelict wrecking ball over the console like a played-out carnie with nothing to show for a lifetime of swindling. His down-to-the-filter cigarette wandered listlessly with a skeletal droop of ash as he leaned on his crippled office chair teasing gravity. He ended up giving in to his heavy eyes and passing out on the couch with his feet up, still holding the cigarette as Brad and I took turns pressing the \"record\" and \"locate\" buttons.[3]","Dripping in goat juice","See, I always found them to be quite awesome.  Good entertainers, songs that very much tell stories.

Immediately after you say not a man moved every single man left wtf man get it together\n\nEdit: People cannot handle a minor critique to a song they like","The word \"till\" makes it acceptable","They were given a pass. The General, in his dream, saw the other soldiers and saw that they had mothers; they were no different than his men. \"This fight is not worth fighting.\" The General knew that both sides would take great loss, and for what? Land? Money? Whatever it was, it wasn't worth dying for.

","Prime includes free movies and tv shows..I've considered getting it for that benefit alone (I don't have cable tv  or hulu etc)","I wouldn't get Prime unless the shipping is your number one factor. As far as I could tell for the year I had it, basically everything they have, Netflix has, but there's a lot of good stuff on Netflix (especially originals) that Prime doesn't. There's nothing about it that makes it stand out as a better or even equivalent option.","This used to be the case but the libraries are varied enough(prime has a decent older movie selection) that I would say it's totally worth it. Maybe not for that alone but you have the shipping as stated and if you ship, don't remember exactly, around 20 items then it's payed for in total. As well, you have the spotify type service that works well and has a decent selection. Then you also have the photo backup. Personally, I would get rid of Netflix and Spotify before Prime. ","I like prime now(2 hour shipping) and free next day on orders over $35. The movie stuff is a bonus on top of the shipping. ","Music, too. They added that about 6 months ago or so. \n\nLike the other guy who responded to you said, Amazon Prime is not comparable to Netflix as an overall service, but there are sometimes when Prime will have something Netflix doesn't. \n\nOne of the primary bitches I'd have about it is that everything Netflix has is available with a subscription, whereas with Amazon, some of the programming is still available for a fee, with only some of the content viewable on Prime. \n\nI see where Amazon Prime is now a standalone service available without having to pay for the shipping service - which is what I actually use it for. I don't think I'd be interested in it for only that when compared to Netflix, but that's only if someone where having to choose between the two. ","Haha! Twenty-five times?

Either way, I wouldn't be surprised.","He is 14 years old...how much stupid shit does everyone do when they're young","I dunno, I remember being 14 and I knew the difference between a fuck up and a 600 dollar fuck up.","so? he's learned that lesson now right? again, still children we're dealing with\n\neverybody's life doesn't have one monolithic and singular experience that's exactly the same as yours .. ","Sure lesson learnt, but there are some lessons that you can learn without being stupid af.\n\nDo you really need to drive over the speed limit, get into an accident, possibly get injuries, to know that speeding can cause accidents?\n\nNo.\n\nSomething more nuanced like not exercising your employee rights properly and then overworking/getting paid less or something like that can be a lesson learn from experience. But strictly stupid things are stupid.","In some cases, you probably do need to get into an accident before realizing that you shouldn't speed.  Sure, people know that speeding could cause an accident.  However, there is a massive difference between \"some people get in accidents when they speed\" and \"if I speed, there's a good chance that I will get in an accident\".  It's easy to rationalize things away with \"others could, but I'm better/smarter/faster/etc so it won't happen to me\".\n\nAlso, you have to ask the right question before you can find the obvious answer.  Say there's a pot of boiling water on the stove.  Someone goes to pick it up without pot holders and burns themself.  Is that a stupid mistake?  Yes.  Of course the pot is hot, its been on the stove for the last 20 minutes.  And of course hot things can burn you.  Is that a mistake that a smart person shouldn't have made?  Eh.\n\nIn day to day life (assuming you don't spend much time in the kitchen), you can generally pick up just about everything without worrying about heat.  In that case, you probably assume that temperature isn't an issue without every consciously thinking about it.  Now, you are dealing with a new experience (cooking on a stove), and that assumption is no longer valid.  However, the whole point of an assumption is that you aren't consciously thinking about it.  Therefore, you continue to assume subconsciously that heat isn't an issue and you burn yourself on a hot stove.  It is extraordinarily stupid, but it is a perfectly understandable mistake to make (once, at least).","&gt; Do you really need to drive over the speed limit, get into an accident, possibly get injuries, to know that speeding can cause accidents?\n\nyeah... even though I agree with you, I just read that you don't own a car so... maybe you should choose another example until then... I mean, I don't think the majority of people who get into an accident suddenly woke up one day and decided \"you know what? speed limits are overrated, let's not give a fuck about that anymore\". No denying there are people that stupid, just saying sometimes you go over the limit for... you know, reasons... bad reasons, but they don't seem that bad in the heat of the moment because you don't actually think about it.  \n I'm positive 99% of drivers drive over the speed limit from time to time, and a lot of times to make up for the time lost because of the other 1% who always drive 5mph under the speed limit just to be sure they don't get into an accident (most people think they don't fit into either of these categories, but think again guys, and try to be honest with yourself)... Still saying it's a bad bad idea, but my point is it's not an idea, there is no decision process involved here... You don't ask yourself if going a little faster will put someone's life at risk, you're just thinking \"shit I'm late for work\" and press slightly harder on the gas pedal without even thinking about it.","&gt;  just read that you don't own a car so... maybe you should choose another example until then... \n\nwait wait wait. WTF. Just because I don't own a car doesn't mean I haven't been in one. It doesn't mean I don't know the common knowledge involved with cars and it sure has hell has no effect on my example. That was the point there. That I don't need to be in an accident, or hell, even own a car, to know speeding is dangerous.\n\n&gt; I mean, I don't think the majority of people who get into an accident suddenly woke up one day and decided \"you know what? speed limits are overrated, let's not give a fuck about that anymore\"\n\nYou seem to be totally misunderstanding what I said. The point was: A lesson can be learned without making a mistake. The car example was one. And the $600 fuckup was another. \n\n&gt; No denying there are people that stupid, just saying sometimes you go over the limit for... you know, reasons... bad reasons, but they don't seem that bad in the heat of the moment because you don't actually think about it.\nI'm positive 99% of drivers drive over the speed limit from time to time, and a lot of times to make up for the time lost because of the other 1% who always drive 5mph under the speed limit just to be sure they don't get into an accident (most people think they don't fit into either of these categories, but think again guys, and try to be honest with yourself)...

There is no lesson to be learned here. Even a driver, who HASN'T been in a speeding accident, knows that he is mistaking a mistake by speeding. \n\nIn conclusion, some lessons don't require mistakes to be made to be learned. Those are called common sense. And I am arguing that this $600 was not a simple mistake necessary to be made to learn that spending someone else's money IRRESPONSIBLY has repercussions. ","&gt;wait wait wait. WTF. Just because I don't own a car doesn't mean I haven't been in one.  \n  \nbut you haven't been like ten thousand times in a situation where pushing that gas pedal just a little more without even thinking about it could save your ass... is what I meant.   \nAnyways I indeed got kinda lost in my own comment at some point and don't remember exactly what I really wanted to say about games and microtransactions at first. Something like \"buying another microtransaction is like driving over the limit by a couple mph, it seems harmless and the more you do it the more it seems like you can get away with it, until you fuck up big time\"  \n","Are you really trying to argue that going 1 mile an hour over the speed limit is always a mistake?  Going too fast is clearly a mistake.  \"Too fast\" doesn't necessarily have a close connection to the speed limit.  There are a lot of places where the speed limit is X and I know damn well that it is completely safe (in good conditions, at least) to do X+Y.  If it is raining/snowing/dark/whatever, sure, I will slow down (possibly to below the speed limit, depending on the conditions).  That doesn't mean that going over the speed limit is always unsafe.\n\nFor that matter, there are also a lot of situations where going 10 over the speed limit is safer than going 5 under the speed limit -- if everyone around you is going at a given speed, matching them will be safer than praying that the guy behind you notices you and doesn't rear end you.\n\nI guess this might be culture dependent to an extent.  In the US (or at least the mid atlantic/northeast), people tend to assume that the enforced speed limit is actually 10mph higher than the listed limit, and I think that listed limits are often lowered to counteract that.  Is that a pretty stupid system?  Yes.  Fixing it is somewhat harder, though.","Difference being I had the foresight to never HAVE to learn from my mistakes. \"oops lol sorry bro guess you're out 600 dollars\" isn't justified because you \"learn you lesson\" afterwards.","What's it like to be born with perfect foresight?

You bet your ass I'm economical. Within reason. Accounting for biases and habits. And liquor. \n\n3) Kids can get emotional and angry and spiteful and vengeful and wanting to get attention etc. I've seen far worse than spending stolen $600.

Even if the kid knew he was spending his brother's money, it's unlikely that it was out of malice.  \n\nIt's important to learn why the kid thought it was OK to use his brother's money.  This develops a base level of trust in the kid's character that he needs to know his parents have in him.  \n\nUnderstanding this will allow him to direct future discussions of his mistakes into \"this is why I did this, why am I wrong?\"  This question is important because his mistakes will get more complicated as he gets older, and it is a question he will have to ask himself in adulthood.","My 20 year old brother has his bank account tied onto a Clash of Clans account and GTA 5 online. My 13 year old brother uses both of them and got into the habit of spending money on in game transactions.

I, not wanting it to happen again, informed my parents who were livid about it. They told him that what he did was not something that you could classify as just a little thing. They told him that he would be working every summer from here on out to repay him for what he has spent.","When I was that age, I was dumb enough to believe a porn site which said they didn't need your bank account information for money, they just needed it to confirm your age.

It's dumb to assume that this was as malicious as everyone is making it seem. The microtransactions seem most likely, and coupled with the fact that $600 is so far beyond the scale at which most 14-year-olds would think, I feel like this was probably a mistake that the kid either doesn't realize happened or now that he's been confronted with it is petrified of admitting to it because he's realizing what actually happened.","I need to know what happen next.","To me?

Almost every microtransaction requires a verification process for the purchases to be made on the card.

But a 14 year old? Unless he's got a serious learning disability, at this age he definitely knew what he was doing. I was very very clear at that age what required real money and what did not.","I think you're right in that he likely knew he was spending real money and that it was wrong, but I can see the point that it could have been the *scale* that escaped him.

Holy crap did I really spend that much? Nah...nah, couldn't have. *Deny deny deny*. Same thing happens to many adults when they get their first credit card bill and realize that all those little this-and-that purchases add up to a bunch of money *that they still have to come up with*.

Ideally, it should be something constructive (like a repayment plan or some other, less direct restitution)*\n\n\nRepaying the money is not optional, or \"one of the options\", it's critical, the 14YO stole from the 17YO, if the 14YO is not able to be responsible for this the parents need to step in and make up the difference. I'd damn well expect the parents to empty the 14YOs bank account and sell all his posessions to make up that $600. Even if the parents pay for some of it they need to make sure the 14YO is the one who suffers, \"no sorry we can't pay for your guitar lessons because we gave you the money your brother stole\" is just as bad as leaving the 17Yo without the money.\n\n\nAnyone who thinks this family unit is going to function if the money is not paid back is divorced from reality, if the younger brother is allowed to get away with this without paying back the money then the family is done for.

This money was hard earned, he did hard dirty work for. If I was that 17YO everytime I saw them spend money on somemthing like ice cream for the family I'd be seeing that as my money, apparently there's money to spend on my little brother who stole $600 from me but not money to give me back some of that $600.","Given the information the OP provided, it seems that the 14 year old used the brother's card for his video games. We can discuss intent all we want, but in the end, the younger brother (possibly by accident) ended up costing his brother $600. \n\nPersonally, I think this is a great time to teach the 14 year old and the 17 year old a few lessons. In the real world if you cause someone harm, even without any mal intent, you still need to pay. Just today I saw someone unloading their van, and they hit the car next to them, causing a slight dent. The person who did the damage did not do so intentionally, and wasn't even particularly reckless, he just made a bad move and now needs to pay. Similarly, I will assume the 14 year old was not being malicious, or even understood the impact of his actions, but guess what, he caused harm and should pay up. He is old enough to get a part time job (a few hours each weekend) doing dishes, working for McDonalds, bussing tables, etc. to pay off the debt.\n\nAs for trust, the father needs to present the evidence and ask the 14 year old one more time if he did it. If he refuses to admit fault, he loses privileges to use the PS4. If not he has full right to use it, but under a separate account. The PS4 is a privilege, and if the 14 year old cannot even admit to his wrong doing, he loses the privilege. Being an adult is owning up to your wrong doings.\n\nAs for the 17 year old, you need to teach him the ability to accept apologies, and forgive wrong doings if the 14 year old works to pay him back.

I'm saying that they need to be taught to manage it better. First of all tying a debit card to an online game platform is just a terrible idea because it's virtually impossible to dispute charges. Second it's clear they aren't managing it well because it took 2 months to notice $20 transactions every other day.\n\nThose two facts alone make it clear that they need help managing their account.","At 16 I got a job, and a debit card that I could use as I pleased. 17 is not too young for a debit card, if the person is working, they earned that money.","Ima just wade into the sea of your downvotes and tell you that I agree with you.\n\nI got my first  job at 17, and my first checking account to match.

Then within a few years my card was used illegally (not by me) and about $1k was gone. There was literally NO recourse; my hard-earned money was just gone.\n\nI wish my stupid seventeen-year-old self was cognizant of the dangers of a debit card.

Some kids can, yes, but clearly this one can't.\n\n&gt;How do you even check your account weekly\n\nMy budgeting app automatically pulls in my bank account transactions as soon as they clear (typically about 3 days). Before then I just didn't check it that often (maybe once a month?) because I just never used a debit card. For my credit card, I'd just look through my statement quickly about once a week and see if there was anything that I didn't pay for and dispute it if needed. I've had to do this maybe 3x in my adult life. The disputes are usually resolved within the month and I don't have to pay for it. It took ~5 minutes a week. With my current budgeting app, it's automatic and I don't really have to do anything.\n\n&gt;The bank won't care, but small claims court will (if they're both adults).\n\nGood luck with that when (as has happened to one friend of mine) your debit card is skimmed from a machine and you are out over $1k and you don't even know who did it. And even if you knew the person, do you really think it's easy to just go to court to get it back? It's a serious cost in time and some money. Why not avoid it in the first place?\n\nSeriously, if you are using debit cards for everyday transactions, you are putting yourself at completely  unnecessary risk.

I specifically said it wasn't (and his brother definitely should be punished in some way). I'm saying that his financial management skills are shit and that clearly needs guidance because he didn't notice for *2 months* and he's using a debit card for everyday expenses. He has zero recourse to ever get his money back because of both those things. In the real world that could have easily been his entire checking account and now he can't pay rent and he gets evicted.\n\nHere, let me put it this way: Imagine if I leave $600 in an envelope on my front porch and don't check on it for months on end and it ends up missing. Yeah, it's not my fault that it's stolen, but I also shouldn't have been as careless with it.\n\nIf this were with a credit card, that would be one thing.

Professionalism is a word that's invoked so scare you into acting right. There's focus on toning down the paternalism of medicine and deferring to the patient. In building rapport and getting the patient to \"buy in\" on their care by coming up with a treatment plan that makes sense, this is great. It starts to veer into letting the patient dictate their care at times, and that's a problem. And that's being perverted into a way to look at patients as customers rather than patients. Or so I'm told. \n\nI wrote this in another post, but you're going to hear a lot of doctors complain and tell you not to go into medicine because it sucks compared to how it used to be. In a lot of ways, they're right. But other fields suck more than they used to, too, and medicine is still a better bet than many other professional fields. \n\nThe medical school equivalent is (1) you're going to be treated pretty poorly in medical school.

Have you seen the general derision at pre-meds by (some) med students? That med school is this and that and they wouldn't understand? The hero-worship (some) pre-meds have of med students? Expect more of the same between attendings/residents and M3/M4s. Just with more pimping and less hero-worship. And the hierarchy keeps going. (3) I think there's a real push to pacifying medical students, to turning us into compliant cogs. Very competent, compliant cogs. We're trained and threatened via professionalism into not making waves. Ever. I was thinking about this in the shower. In some campuses across the country there are sit-ins when students are concerned about something that involves administration. If med students found out that someone in administration was saying black people should be lynched and wanted to protest it in some public way I could honestly see them being written up for professionalism and it being put in their Dean's letter to residency programs. There's no protesting, no complaining, you just take it, or your future might get fucked. \n\nIt's honestly a pretty dehumanizing process. You are absolutely told to take it, never complain, and comply. Someone's computer crashed (computer based tests) and was failed on a test. One person who wrote an admittedly seething critique of a few professors during reviews was written up for professionalism. Students make the same critiques about professors and classes almost every year and nothing changes, and nothing ever will. They let you know at every turn that you absolutely do not matter. I think by the time students graduate they like people less and find it easier monetizing them. There's a lot of compassion taught about patients, but in the process that grinds you down, there's no real compassion for you. And the patients I think suffer for that. \n\nBut, you get to be a doctor, and anatomy is dope. A++ would go again. That's my opinion anyway, and I'm admittedly pretty jaded. \n\nMy advice is to use the sn2ed method to study for your MCATs, just modify it for the new subjects, to apply to at least 20 MD programs, DO if you're marginal, and go spend the summer before classes getting shitty drunk (and using DDs). \n\nMy advice for continuing to see patients as people is spending several hours every week outside of medical school doing something entirely different. It's a bubble, it's easy to lose perspective, don't do that. \n\nGood luck! ","Hey, thanks for the in depth response, I always appreciate it!","Doctors can stop this trend as soon as they care to stand up for themselves/patients and demand change. If policies are being enacted at his hospital that negatively impact patient care he is obligated to put a stop to it and honestly is the only one in the position to do so. Does he expect the nurse's union to do it?\n\nWithout highly trained, intelligent and licensed medical care providers administrators literally have nothing. If doctors don't stand against such poor policies they are tacitly approving. ","True, but physicians can not simply strike like other employees. This makes the situation even worse for patients who are physician's ultimate responsibility.\n\nEdit: I recognize Junior Doctor's have and are striking in the UK. However this is really only effecting elective procedures and more senior physicians are present to pick up the significant amount of slack that is left behind.\n","Any strike, whether it's bus drivers, law enforcement, or teachers, makes some situation worse for someone. But workers (yes, ED docs *are* workers) need some sort of leverage to change the system that hums along with the comfort in knowing that it can call someone depending on it a \"customer\" and no one questions that move.\n\nIsn't placating drug-seekers (of opiates and over-prescribed antibiotics) and those who think they know better than the trained profession just as bad for everyone? I think so.","The problem is that when bus drivers strike, they don't risk killing people dependent on them. Firefighters are also a good example. Morally it's hard to justify striking when your profession is about saving people from death","Morality? It's immoral that healthcare isn't a right and that it's run like a business where MDs are rated like Uber drivers or chinese buffets on Yelp. No one should have to check their rights to organize in exchange for doing what they love.","I think the whole economic system is immoral, I'm with you on this point. MDs should have complete control of their workplace, not some overarching bureaucrat. Their right to organize is untouchable, but a global strike could have horrible consequences we don't really want. You can't have gradual ripost against bad leadership in a profession that rescues people.\n\nIn short, they have to organize, but this organization must not put innocent lives at risk.","[deleted]","Two words: Hippocratic Oath","No one is suggesting physicians strike. That is unnecessary and overkill.\n\nThey simply need to say no we are not going to do that. What is the administrator going to do? Fire the attending physician? And his interns? Everyone else?

The nurses want their position to be equated to every other nurse's in EU, right now they are considered on the level of a part-time cleaning worker. The government tried to turn it into an excuse to criminalize strike rights for healthcare workers, police and fire department and they got an even bigger strike.","Well, good on them.

Once I started using a powerchair they assigned me tech stuff without proper training and only evaluated me on that and not the other 85% of my work. Needless to say redundancy ensued and was unable to get a job the majority because of disability. If I mentioned to recruitment agencies I was disabled and relied on a powerchair I never heard from them again. I turn up to an interview and there's always some lame excuse to ignore over 20 years of tech experience at all levels.

The problem is that patients come in with viral infections and insist on antibiotics and poorly review physicians for not granting them and adversely affect their employment and compensation. So now some physicians say fuck it and endanger everyone's health.

So instead we get people insisting on dictating their healthcare, often to their or the collective detriment, because they think their rights as patient supersede the role of the physician and the good of the community. That's the broader question we'll have to answer as a society. ","Of course we don't give them antibiotics when they don't need them but we also need to educate them on the *why*. Good customer service is both providing quality medical care and ensuring the patient knows that you're providing good care.

One makes them happy and give good feedback and the other is good for their health.","There's a big difference between fostering goodwill with a patient who you see in a calm situation like in a family doctor's office or a specialist's office and treating emergent conditions in an emergency room. Sure, patients do better in the long term when they have a relationship with a doctor that they trust. But the emergency room's primary purpose is to figure out who is sick and what they need in the short term; and if people walk out dissatisfied from an ED, well, they're walking. ","Most patients in the ED are not truly emergent and those that are generally don't complain. Even your level 2's and 3s tend to have higher satisfaction rates, it's the people that come with non urgent complaints that kill your scores and even then, a solid split track model can minimize a lot of that.

Nonetheless, they reverse the dysrythmia, and ask the Urgent Care to transport the patient out via emergency ambulance - staffed by two paramedics. The Urgent Care refuses, and takes over care of the patient. Said payient will await a consult from the on-call cardiologist before the insurance will approve the transport.\n\nHe was covered, by Obamacare sponsored insurance. A perfectly legal plan. And he was failed by the same plan. Not knowing whether he lived or died does not bother me, his EMT. Knowing that his government mandated insurance did not care does.\n\nSadly, I have seen this scene play out and others not dissimilar. We in the field are constantly frustrated by them, yet we have no recourse. The insurance company is king now, and will remain as such until a time as public medicine becomes a reality.\n\nAnd in the meantime, hospitals and services will treat this as a service industry. Catering to the whims of the customer, giving them the 'five star' service. But the cuatomer is not the patient. It is now the patient's HMO plan. Their managed care providers. Bean counters who manage dcotors and nurses into managing patients into dangerous treatment plans and tell each other they have helped save lives and give each other Double Diamond Awards for customer service without ever having cradled an injured child. Or listened to his mother bawl. Or splay hands across a dead man's chest and provide him a poor heartbeat substitute. Or suction blood, vomit, mucous, and sand from the mouth of a seventeen year old drowning victim, dead from celebrating her college acceptance.\n\nThese things mean less to them than the money collected for insurance, and the amount paid to those who tried their best and failed.","Are you telling me that in your country of 'the world's best medicine', private hospitals know how to treat an SVT better than a run down public one?\n\nThat is bullshit of the highest degree. \n\nEven here with our 'eeeevil socialist' NHS at least I know every A&amp;E department across the country has access to the cardiologists and drugs to treat an SVT.

Your care is in your insurance compony's hands who is only thinking profits. The doctor who saved my foot told us he had to fight to convince insurance companies not to insist he amputate feet rather than try to save them (I'm not sure if he was talking mine or if he was saying he's had the argument before and finally convinced them to stop going straight to amputation). Basically he convinced them by talking long term costs of maintaining a prosthetic foot over the one time cost of saving the foot. ","Holy fuck, you are really getting downvoted for this comment. I am not in a direct-care position, but I work in the industry and it is very significant to me to hear a pro-socialized medicine anecdote that is also anti-Obamacare. Obamacare was a lateral move.

The ED I worked at limited to 5 minutes including history and physical exam.. Maybe another 5 for follow up discharge discussion and treatment plan. ","Sorry, 15 minutes for an office visit","As industrial engineering and LEAN techniques are applied to healthcare (some of which I'm directly involved in) the terms we use bleed over. Their CxOs take our busswords to be the \"key.\" However, having been in dozens of plants, businesses and organizations and assessing their situation, consulting, I personally believe this is just a temporary trend as the implementation carries a large amount of growing pains... \n\nEventually, and only in time, our policies methods and training will take root. The seed will grow and the culture of the organization will forever be changed. Evolving and growing in it's own ways. Each and every business is as unique as the people that comprise it. \n\nWhen I'm scolded, cussed at and demonized for carrying around a stopwatch in the ER, conducting time studies of different processes, I no longer give it second thought. They don't understand. Yet. In time, and only in time, will they. For now my job is simple. Reduce medical errors. Which requires that I must get in there and directly study the processes employed. \n\nKnowing little about healthcare I have to ask a lot of questions. Which pisses doctors off. They see me as a demon, only there to reduce costs. Quite contrary, we do aim to reduce costs, but to make all staff more capable and enabled to do their jobs. Humans make errors, I am here to figure out the true root cause of these errors, and to design a policy, method or otherwise that prevents it. Error prevention. Poke-yoke. (Idiot proof we call it). \n\nSending a guy with a bullet in his chest to the dialysis unit, cost him his life... I have to overlook that sad fact, and without bias, look at *why* and *how* it occurred. I want patients to have zero waiting times in the ER. Not to cut staff or reduce pay. Exactly the opposite, I wish to train staff, allocate monies for educating them on an ongoing and ever improving basis. \n\nThe consequences are both monetary as well as the cost of human life. Things we (as a team) thought would prevent X issue, ended up killing 4 people... Yes, we live with that. Yes it's horrible. But the current state of the system is unacceptable. The methods employed are overly burdensome, causing people to lose their lives. Red tape, paperwork, communication methods all play their parts. The results of a mistake, in this case, cost people their lives....\n\nIt's far and out one of the toughest projects I've ever been a part of. However, to date, the hospital we are working at, we have reduced ER wait times 86% and realized 14% increased revenue (through cost savings) which are being re-invested to bring all nursing staff up to a 4 year degree. Fully paid by the hospital... yet I'm demonized still. They don't know. They don't understand. They will all get a dollar raise in FY17.... They don't know. I can't tell them.. All of them. Doctors, nurses and even staff all see us as *the problem*. Their bosses have become obsessed with our terminology, and in turn implement policies that attempt (with good intentions) to drive it into the minds of healthcare workers. \n\nWhile we don't resist this situation, as we know from experience that in time everything will take on it's own life. This hospital will begin to innovate and implement LEAN and other methods of error prevention and root cause analysis on their own... as they all do. \n\nWe leave a site, heads down. Seen as the enemy, and in 5 years, when they are running more profitably, realizing less injuries and have increased staff by 50%... no one remembers us. No one says we did that. They all believe they did it. And they did... but still. \n\nI admit. To the OP. That those gold stars are the result of my work. I understand your concerns. Realize how it affects moral and such... but just as it hurts before it gets better, so too, will you one day be in a similar situation and not be surprised when that helo takes only 5 minutes to arrive on site. That doctors will soon carry equipment that can conduct surgeries by any surgeon on earth at your site. Remotely. No more moving people and having them die in transit. No more.... It's a long hard, very very hard road my friend. But I assure you, with a little faith in me, and I will in time show you that you are capable of so much more than you know. That you can save more lives, with less \"effort.\" \n\nOnly you, the professional, can do the work, I resolve only to give you the right tools exactly when you need them to do your job the best you possibly can. I resolve that in my wake, your job will be easier, more effective, and have a lasting impact on those you treat forever more. \n\nThis is my life. Understand that you don't have to understand the process for it to work, you must only to fully buy into it, for it to work. We need not know how we will get there, only that we will not quit until our goals are realized. Believe in me, because I believe in you sir. Together we will stumble, but together we will change the world. This. I swear to you. \n\nThis \"process\" will take on a life of it's own. It will become a sub-culture. It will do things I cannot even dream of. Because of you, the man doing the work, knows more about it than I ever will.

I know this to be a truth. Focus on the process, and the results will take care of themselves. *How you work, directly impacts the quality of your work.* It's a long hard ass road. One that I'll be there, elbow to elbow with you until we get it right... I've seen a lot of people die in this project, but today I see less of it than when I arrived. Regardless of anyone's opinion of me, I know that my work is going to help you, and in time you will see it too. I carry no resentment or ill will, just as you do not when a patient cusses you for the pain you inflict to cure them. For they do not understand. \n\nWe all play our part. No one can know everyone's job. Or it's function, but when you know that we will never stop \"putting our boots on and going to sweat and bleed next to you\" until we find the solution. Together. Elbow deep in the shit, we will find the answer, and come out of it both better than before. \n\nI'm sorry you feel this way, and I agree with you. But it's a process of change. One that will have a positive impact. I promise this to you OP. Maybe one day we will cross paths. Though we will never know it, each of us is working for the other. You for I and I for you. In the end, human innovation and the fundamental spirit therein will prevail. \n\nIt gets worse before it gets better, but not to change is to die. I'm sorry this evolution is causing you pain, but I too lie awake at night thinking over and over how something I said, did or implemented might be hurting people. Just like you, I carry this burden. Unseen, but nevertheless, heavy and impossible to shake off. I silently will pass you in the hallway one day, and know that I'm human like you, and I too am hurting inside. But the only way through hell is to keep going. \n\nWe will make it. I promise. ","Assuming this isn't just a bullshit diatribe for karma, what's the point of customer satisfaction surveys for medical patients? That seems counter-productive in almost every way. No human patient is going to give a positive review for being given proper medical care, because proper medical care is uncomfortable, invasive, and draining. Maybe you'll say it's because we're \"not there yet\" to a point where proper medical care is no longer uncomfortable, invasive, and draining. But until that day, customer satisfaction surveys can only encourage poor practices. \n\nIf the goal is to save lives, then the metric should be simple: alive=good, not alive=bad. No customer satisfaction surveys needed. ","We survey constantly. A large part of \"human factors engineering\" is gatering \"raw information.\" \n\nThrough giving these surveys, while unlikely to be beneficial, one doesn't know (and would be incorrect to presume otherwise) that the end user has no input that could be useful to the engineer. \n\nWe poll executives just like we do workers and the end users. They tell me \"they know xyz for sure.\" To which I note, and simply observe. Nothing is either good or bad... Everything, from the IEs prospective, must be viewed simply as just that. A thing. \n\nLater, and through many many late nights, do we read through and compile information into tables, tools and other methods by which we can generate quantative analysis. A simple and single comment from a single and *relatively* unimportant worker or even customer can and often does provide the final dot needed for that \"THATS IT\" moment. \n\nWe hear all kinds of things. And to inspire trust, and to be a good engineer, I do not pass on or discuss the information (mostly in the form of opinions) of any person with any other within the organization in question. \n\nIf a customer was to state simply that they had to fill out 21 pages of paper to get into the ER... and 6 were identical... I'd immediately flag it as a place for further investigation. Do we need 6 of the same form? Can we use carbon copies? When I go to HR and inquire about it, they assume what my purpose is, usually incorrectly, but I need to find out if I can eliminate 5 pages... That's all. Workers are often guarded, lie to me, (I have total and complete access to any and all information I want, so I'm not worried about being fooled) but I do note that I should look at *why* they felt the need to lie. My aim is never to punish, and I would never tell management of such a situation, but simply raise the issue indirectly. \n\nPeople all have hidden information. IEs, during the discovery phase (which never really ends), must first collect it all in order to be confident in our analysis. Surveys are wildly helpful, but always tainted. We know this, and have tools and methods to deal with this. \n\nEDIT: It's not as simple as alive=good and dead=bad. There's a billion degrees of difference between the best and worst possible cases... Slowly, we work to move the curve up the graph toward an impossible ideal. Perfection. Our goal is actually that. Perfection. The factors that play into such a system are insanely complex. One wouldn't think that there's a direct and mathematically proven correlation between the cleanliness of break rooms and the rates at which patients are serviced. Not something many would ever conclude any other way than through raw and unabated statistical analysis of **a lot** of information. Workers get pissed when I implement and demand they clean their break room, and they don't understand the purpose. In this case it's futile to explain it, because every armchair statistician employed there would come to me with their \"analysis.\" But results are results. We made the change, and saw the results we thought we would. Onto the next thing. And so on and so on....

You of course already know this.  But what seems to be missing is application to your own art.  Compliance and satisfaction might be much, much easier if you can communicate what and why you do the things you do.  Is it hard?  Yes.  But doctors also need to communicate, even to their most challenging patients.  Even to comatose patients.  What if you could figure out ways to explain your art to your \"patients\" such that they could comprehend your goals and methods?\n\nNow my question.  I'm in medical school.  I know the necessity of systems engineering.  I also know that this is simply not present in a lot of health care, and where it is present there remains significant resistance from rank-and-file health care personnel.

There are certain scores that definitely make sense, for instance, understanding what a new medication is for, and the side effects.

Or, if you are a patient with chronic pain (or substance abuse issues, which is sadly very common), we are not going to be able to completely take away your pain. So, these scores are just not representative of the care we as nurses, doctors, techs, etc. give to every patient that presents to our hospitals.

The rest were baby teeth due to fall out within the next year). It happened at 7:00 on a Monday night, and we ended up driving 30 minutes to one of those new \"neighboorhood emergency room\" places because the local hospitals usually have a multi-hour wait.\n\nSure enough, we got in and he was looked at right away. At which point the doctor left, a clerk came in, and told us the doctor had determined that this wasn't an emergency case and because my wife didn't have her purse with her, and thus we didn't have proof of insurance, they neede $700 on the spot to treat my son. If it had been an emergency we could have worked out a payment plan.\n\nFurious, we left for the nearest hospital. Another 15 minutes in the car, my son at this point was two hours into the most agonizing thing he's ever experienced, and he's confused why a doctor won't help him. We got to a hospital ER around 9:00. He was in an exam room by 10:00. After some exams, a CT scan was ordered that showed his jaw broken in two places. He was admitted and the next day had surgery to \"wire\" his jaw shut. They also removed the shattered molar.\n\nTwo weeks later, he's had the bands out and can open his mouth, and was due to have the metalwork removed. But there was a slight problem: in the course of changing insurance companies, a paperwork problem had created a month-long gap in our coverage leaving my son unable to get the procedure unless we could fork out $1,700. He's having to put up with the metal in his mouth until May.\n\nTHAT is my experience with modern American healthcare. It's enough to drive this particular Republican to favor massive reforms, because this system is so ridiculously broken it's only tolerated by the people who don't actually have to interact with it.\n\nTL;DR: Son fell and knocked out teeth, private ER doctor called it not an emergency and demanded upfront cash payment because insurance card was at home. Hospital ER found his jaw broken in two places and wired it shut, but now insurance problems mean he has to keep the metal in his mouth for several more weeks or we pay $1700 we don't have.","What treatment did you expect from a neighborhood medical clinic for shattered teeth and broken jaw, not to mention that your son passed out for no mentioned reason.

I shouldn't have to sacrifice either."," There are situations in which you *must* put one above the other. \n\n A doctor cannot always do their job *and* make someone satisfied with their service.

You cannot ask a Doctor to do that either. \n\n I do not believe a Doctor should be primarily concerned with how their patients feel about them personally, they should be primarily concerned with getting the best medical outcome. \n\n If you are arguing you *never* have to sacrifice a patient's personal opinion on your character or service, for any reason, you are objectively wrong. \n\n Even someone in retail can tell you that sometimes you cannot make someone happy all the time, and sometimes you just have to tell them to leave the store or kindly use the bathrooms instead of the aisles. \n \ntl;dr :- Sometimes people are going to be upset they can't get what they want.

There's focus on toning down the paternalism of medicine and deferring to the patient. In building rapport and getting the patient to \"buy in\" on their care by coming up with a treatment plan that makes sense, this is great. It starts to veer into letting the patient dictate their care at times, and that's a problem. And that's being perverted into a way to look at patients as customers rather than patients. Or so I'm told. \n\nI wrote this in another post, but you're going to hear a lot of doctors complain and tell you not to go into medicine because it sucks compared to how it used to be. In a lot of ways, they're right. But other fields suck more than they used to, too, and medicine is still a better bet than many other professional fields. \n\nThe medical school equivalent is (1) you're going to be treated pretty poorly in medical school. Some of it is hazing, some of it is trying to kill your ego a little, and medical students as a whole have large egos. (2) Medicine is very hierarchical and the shit flows down. Have you seen the general derision at pre-meds by (some) med students? That med school is this and that and they wouldn't understand? The hero-worship (some) pre-meds have of med students? Expect more of the same between attendings/residents and M3/M4s. Just with more pimping and less hero-worship. And the hierarchy keeps going. (3) I think there's a real push to pacifying medical students, to turning us into compliant cogs. Very competent, compliant cogs. We're trained and threatened via professionalism into not making waves. Ever. I was thinking about this in the shower. In some campuses across the country there are sit-ins when students are concerned about something that involves administration. If med students found out that someone in administration was saying black people should be lynched and wanted to protest it in some public way I could honestly see them being written up for professionalism and it being put in their Dean's letter to residency programs. There's no protesting, no complaining, you just take it, or your future might get fucked. \n\nIt's honestly a pretty dehumanizing process. You are absolutely told to take it, never complain, and comply. Someone's computer crashed (computer based tests) and was failed on a test. One person who wrote an admittedly seething critique of a few professors during reviews was written up for professionalism. Students make the same critiques about professors and classes almost every year and nothing changes, and nothing ever will. They let you know at every turn that you absolutely do not matter. I think by the time students graduate they like people less and find it easier monetizing them. There's a lot of compassion taught about patients, but in the process that grinds you down, there's no real compassion for you. And the patients I think suffer for that. \n\nBut, you get to be a doctor, and anatomy is dope. A++ would go again. That's my opinion anyway, and I'm admittedly pretty jaded. \n\nMy advice is to use the sn2ed method to study for your MCATs, just modify it for the new subjects, to apply to at least 20 MD programs, DO if you're marginal, and go spend the summer before classes getting shitty drunk (and using DDs). \n\nMy advice for continuing to see patients as people is spending several hours every week outside of medical school doing something entirely different.

It will then result in fairer insurance practices which should reduce insurance costs, increase hospital receivables from insurance companies, and increase the number of insured. Lastly, those should drive the prices of services down and hopefully allow people who need care, but couldn't afford it, to now be able to seek care.

I've spent more hours in medical school on acknowledging the importance of others in the health care profession and administration than I have how to ascultate the heart. We're literally trained to not interfere with administration.\n\nI honestly haven't seen this in any of the hospitals I've worked at. I feel like docs have much more pull and the hospitals I've been at (successful and not so successful ones) have docs that interfere if they don't feel like it's in the best interest of the patient. ","Unfortunately, hospitals have to keep the lights on. ","You should teach yourself to have a backbone then.\n\nAt my institution we teach doctors to have independent thoughts and to put patient care first. In fact, they make all the medical students take an oath about it.\n\nDoctors have the authority and obligation to stand up for patients. If they fail to do so by allowing administrators to create regulations that negatively impact patient care they are failing to uphold their oath.","[deleted]","Mostly medicaid/medicare as their reimbursement policies are much stricter","&gt; current state of healthcare\n\nWhat, the state of having helicopters that only fit one parent?  Having ventilators that chime and puff?","If you're not interested in trying to understand the comment then there's no need to reply. ","Cute reply. Lacking substance. The point is they took amazing care of the kid. A 5-star effort, you might say.","You just don't see willful ignorance this pure anymore these days. ","Nah, the one where the \"customers\" money is more important then the health of a child, or anyone for that matter","But it wasn't, not in this story. They called in a helicopter to get the \"customer\" to a \"competitor.\" Burger King doesn't pull around a limo to take me to Wendy's.","1. They sure do.  Doctors groups are everywhere. But their focus isnt the patient, it is money.\n\n2.  The ACA was brought down by doctors who stayed silent during the \"debate\". And when I say \"debate\" I mean when Republicans bitched about a \"death panel\".  They already knew there was a \"death panel\", the insurance companies...  they could have said something. But wait... insurance companies is where they make their money. Well...fuck...\n\n3. Bullshit. There are plenty of egotistical doctors out there. Dont believe me? Visit one when you are sick.  They blame you for it, make it your fault for  not taking care of yourself, etc.   As a Type 1 Diabetic, I find that kind of thinking pretty fucking punchable.\n\nDoctors have tons of power, they never wield it because it hurts their pocket books. And sure, you can say \"well look how much it costs to get into the medical industry\"...  pffftttt, look how many grants are out there.\n\nThe point is, there is maybe 1 in 30 doctors that actually care, the rest just want to collect a paycheck. Maybe they were beaten by the system, maybe their parents pushed them into it, or maybe they just like money... who gives a fuck.  We are letting too many shitty doctors in, thereby degrading the field into a missmash of horseshit.\n\nDoctors have the most power in the medical field, they chose not to use it.\n\nYou want to know why the line of thinking came about about the \"customers not patients\" thing?  because patients are taking notice of the shit quality they are getting, and they are getting pissed off.","1) Bullshit. If that were true, the vast majority of doctors would actually feel like they were being compensated enough. Fact of the matter is, they're not. They've been saddled with more busy work in the last two decades that they can barely make a connection with their patients and *hate* that. The AMA is pushing hard for more residency positions despite knowing that with more doctors there's less wages available overall, especially since they know there's more people that are going to be needing doctors soon. Do they pay enough attention to primary care or any of the more cerebral medical fields? No. But that's a problem with procedures vs thinking, not your supposed \"they want money more than they care about patients\" bullshit.\n\n2) No it wasn't. Doctors hate dealing with insurance, and the vast majority of them would prefer to not have to deal with insurance at all. They *LOSE* money on dealing with insurance, and so do hospitals. That's part of the reason healthcare costs so high--hospitals know that no matter what they charge, insurance companies are only gonna pay 20% of it. So they charge 6 times more, get paid 15% of it, and the patient generally has to put forward a couple hundred bucks. It sucks for the patient without health insurance, but that's what ACA ended up covering, and that was mostly at the expense of the healthy.\n\n3) There's plenty of egotistical *EVERYONE* out there. For a doctor to make it through AT MINIMUM 11 years of education and training and probably more after high school, they're kinda inclined to think they know a lot of shit about medicine and to think that the vast majority of disease would be gone if people took care of their diet and exercise better. Now you're type 1 so you don't have that, but for every patient that comes in with a thirty year history of obesity and is Type 2 diabetic... yeah, you can bet the average doctor is gonna tell them to kick their own asses into gear if they ever want to live a healthy life.\n\nIf doctors *didn't* wield their power because it hurt their pocket book, assholes would have destroyed them long ago. The medical system doesn't run without them, and if they were only interested in money, they'd have never gone into medicine to begin with, because there's a lot of easier ways to make money. Do they want compensation? Hell yeah. The vast majority of them go a quarter million dollars into debt just in med school before earning only around 45K a year for several years before getting real money, and they freaking deserve it, or we wouldn't have any doctors willing to help us. Hell, there's probably something like four nurses to every doctor, and you're not putting *any* blame on the nurses unions? The ones that actually have voting power? Or onto the insurance companies? That shows me you've clearly not done any real research into this.\n\nYou wanna know why the \"customers not patients\" thing is a thing? Because people wanted to have some metric to grade healthcare by, and patient satisfaction was the easiest way they could do it, despite the fact that opiates and antibiotics aren't always appropriate regardless of their request. It's sure as hell not the doctors fault that patients are getting shit quality.\n\nIf you're blaming your doctors for your shit healthcare and high costs, you haven't done your research, and you haven't begun to appreciate the ridiculously high opportunity costs and sacrifices your average doctor has to pay to even get into the field to begin with, nor have you seen the minuscule amount that doctor salaries even cover in the entire healthcare bill.","1) That 15 minute bullshit was thought up by the insurance companies in the early 90s. I remember hearing about it on the radio and thinking \"nah... no doctor would allow that\".  The fact that they did, shows everyone, including the Insurance companies... who controls healthcare. It isnt the doctors, and it is their fault. If there were no doctors under contract with an insurance company, who would buy the fucking insurance?\n\nThey didnt fight it why? Because the insurance companies threw money at them as long as they held to some guidelines, which Im sure the insurance companies made look good.\n\nDoctors grouped up, making doctors groups, which purposes were to manage their money, but now it is to hold weight over hospitals, but not insurance companies.\n\n2) How do they lose money to a \"guaranteed income\"? You make no sense and provide nothing to back it up. In fact EMR increases the payment turnaround FROM the insurance companies, if it is a good insurance company. Not all do that, but that is a shady problem that they should deal with on contract negotiation. Nothing we, as patients, should be worried about.\n\nLets not get too deep into how hospitals charge and how they get reimbursed, because what you are saying is complete nonsense and made up bullshit.\n\n3) Assumptions kill people when it comes to health. That is my point.  Ego is inherently assumptive, and so is a lot of your post.\n\nWeird.\n\nAs for the end there, Im just not going to jump into it.  Another bunch of assumptive shit that has no idea how the industry works.  Hospitals will actually pay for a lot of things if a doctor or nurse signs a contract to work for them, not to mention the grants I already did mention.\n\nI will also say that nurse unions work for doctors and are dictated by doctors.  They have some say, but only to the doctors, that is it. Bringing them up is like grasping for straws for someone else to blame for this bullshit.\n\nI blame doctors in general, it took me 5 doctors to find a good one.  WHy is that?\n\nI dont really need to tell you much more, but to prove that I know what Im talking about, I have 5/7ths of my immediate family in the medical field, 3/7ths actually working in it.\n\nSo... bye bye. ","1) Nah. The insurance groups are the ones lobbying. They're the ones with the power here, not individual doctors. If you were paying attention, you'd see most doctors have been selling off their private practices and group practices because it makes no sense for them to continue it: their profits are dropping like a rock.\n\n2) That guaranteed income doesn't come anywhere near their operating costs. It's not nonsense or made up bullshit, and frankly you've provided nothing to back up your points either, so back atcha, big guy.\n\n3) You're making an incredible amount of assumptions in bad faith towards the people that are most directly responsible for your care. Forgive me if I think that's bullshit and that most people in the medical professions actually care about people.\n\nNurse unions work for doctors? BS! If that were true, CRNAs, NPs, and so much more would have never happened the way they did.\n\nIf it took you five doctors to find a \"good one\" it's because you either had a complex case that not all doctors were ready to deal with or you were a patient that not all doctors were able to deal with. Having a couple family members in the medical field literally means nothing to knowing how it works. So... bye bye.","Just to add to your point number 2: Medicare reimburses the hospital I work at in the neighborhood of $1200 for a CABG procedure. That's $1200 for at MINIMUM of 2 hours OR time with a minimum of 4 people (1-2 surgeons, 1 PA, 1 perfusionist, 1+ techs), a minimum 1 day ICU stay, and a 1-2 day stay on the step down unit, while being attended to by the nurses, respiratory tech while you're in the unit and the PCA + phlebotomist to draw labs while you're on the floor.\n\n$1200 barely covers the cost of the meds, OR materials, and nursing time.","Troll...\n\nblocked now.

The concerns are real and as such should be considered. However, your mother does not have medical training and there are plenty of other health things at play, some of which she may not be aware. Now, from the doctors perspective. Let her choose her course of therapy and what if there is a complication or an issue arises? Then it is the doctors fault for \"not treating her properly.\" Let your doctor choose the therapy. Then it is \"my doctor is not listening to me.\"","Absolutely. The doctor has way more experience than I do. If he insists on treating something one way, there's probably a good reason for that, and while you might ask him why the other things aren't good options, he's not out of line for being sure about his plan. Getting a second opinion is valid to confirm, but why should he have to listen to you when you don't have a solid understanding of the medicine involved.\n\nI had a form of bone cancer, the doctor told me that I would need to have surgery to remove it and he mentioned that chemo and radiation aren't effective against this type of tumor.

That was the end of the story, from her perspective. \n\nIf the patient refuses that course of treatment, the proper course of action is to explore alternative treatments.  It is not up to the doctor to simply keep pressing the same treatment option on her until she acquiesces.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with seeking a second opinion.

","I'm American and where I am we say both. Given my experience, not very many people know there are other queens. There is the Queen of England and that is it. It wasn't until my last year of high school some of us learned that Spain had royalty too. So when people say \"He/she went to go visit the Queen\" or \"The Queen is coming\" they either mean Beyonce or the Queen of England.","Alternatively if they say \"Queen is coming\" then Freddie Mercury is apparently back from the dead.","FYI she's not the Queen of England; that's not been a title since 1707.\n\n&gt;[Anne became Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland on 8 March 1702. On 1 May 1707, under the Acts of Union, two of her realms, the kingdoms of England and Scotland, united as a single sovereign state known as Great Britain. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain)","Here's a question for you then. Is she  still the Queen of England, in the same way that Canada happens to have the same Queen as we do? Is it legitimate to call her the Queen of, say, London, or Berkshire, or wherever? Because it seems to me that 'Queen Of England' is a subset of 'Queen of Great Britain' \n\nGenuinely asking here, if you happen to know. ","No, because the Acts of Union 1706/7 dissolved the kingdoms of Scotland and England and replaced it with a single Kingdom of Great Britain. Canada is a separate kingdom. The current kingdom is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Queen of England is always wrong, because there is no kingdom to be queen of.\n\nEqually, Queen of Great Britain has been wrong since 1801.","So there is no such thing as Scotland or England? ","Yes, but they're not kingdoms. Have you never played CK2?","So there is an England, and it is part of Great Britain? Wouldn't the Queen of the kingdom be the reigning monarch of all descending territories in that kingdom? ","I think that they are trying to say that while yes she is queen over the territory of England, amongst other places, \"Queen of England\" is not her correct title. It would be like calling Obama \"President of Texas\". Correct from a certain point of view, but not the done thing.\n\nMind you, if you want to be properly correct you have to say \"Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\".","It's like saying Obama is the President of New York. New York is not a country to be president of, it's a state. Yes the USA includes New York but that's not the same thing.","I'm American and I very rarely here \"the Queen of England.\" Most of the time it's just \"Queen Elizabeth\" or \"the Queen\" if the topic is already established. As for the rest of the royal family, I've noticed a divide in males and females. I feel like most men just say \"William\" or \"Kate\" whereas the girls I know always say \"Prince William.\"","Queen of England isn't even an existing title so they must clearly be referring to some long dead monarch of at least 300 and potentially 400 years ago so it's good that they don't say that","Right, but very few Americans know that. To them (us), she is \"the Queen of England.\" I don't know why that mistake is the default here. And agreeing with many others: I think it's fair to say that for most Americans, if you say \"the Queen,\" they automatically think of Elizabeth. \n\nEdit: bad grammar","\"Prince Charles\" is pretty ubiquitous, though. ","We even gave him his own comic here with his twin brother Gallant! ","We (Americans) will often call the Queen \"the Queen\". See? I just did it. Yes, we also might say \"the Queen of England\". The distinction between Britain and England seems to be lost on a lot of people here.\n  \nI'm in Massachusetts, for the record. ","American in Oklahoma here.\n\nI don't know anyone who specifies \"of England.\" Everyone just calls her \"The Queen.\"","To be fair, there's no Queen of the Commonwealth. She's the head of the Commonwealth, sure. But each Commonwealth Realm is a separate Kingdom that just happen to be in a personal union. So she's the Queen of the United Kingdom and also the Queen of Australia and Queen of Jamaica and Queen of Belize etc.\n\nBut OMG Queen of England is one thing that still tickles my inner pedant.

It just says the passport belongs to her government. It doesn't say I have to accept her as my rightful superior. True, she's got more money, power, corgis and influence than me. But you can't judge a fish by how well it climbs trees. I passed my 11+ and had a Top Tip published in Viz, so I'm superior to her in some respects. If I had my say, I'd vote for one of The Nolans as queen. Or Cerys Matthews.","Well, if you hold a British passport, you'll find the Royal Coat of Arms on the front cover and the motto \"Dieu et mon driot\" (God and my right), which is the motto of the British monarch. It should also state inside that you travel in the name of Her Majesty. \n\nWell, if the passport belongs to Government, and the Government is made up of Ministers of the Crown, surely if you concede that the Government is your \"superior\" (your word), and that she is the superior of the Government, she is, by extension, your superior. \n\nAnyway, that's besides the point.

","I think i'm in love!","&lt;3","For those who don't get it https://youtu.be/dOOTKA0aGI0?t=2m","That's why having a non-elected head of state is a good thing. She represents everyone and is not politically divisive. Cameron cannot represent the state as he is a political figure. People can say \"well I didn't vote for him\". The Queen represents the whole nation precisely because she is not elected.","I've never seen a president who was as good a head of state as the Queen. They're either megalomaniacs or insipid committee types. Heads of state are for diplomacy. Leave the governing to the government.","There's an expression,  but I can't remember it.

For Republicans, if any candidate ( Trump this time is more likely) gets 1237 delegates in the primaries, it will be extremely difficult and 'unseemly' ( though not technically impossible, as far as I know) to deny him the nomination.","On the Republican side though, you have a huge disconnect between the Republican party leaders and the voters of said party. Trump is overwhelming popular with Republicans yet the party leaders hate him because he would be such an unknown. They aren't a fan of Ted Cruz either because he is massively anti-Establishment. \n\nThey are now doing everything they can to stop Trump reaching 1237 delegates so that he doesn't win the first round of voting at the convention, hence co tested convention, free vote for all delegates and they can pick someone else. Rumours are, since Cruz and Trump are unpopular in the party, they will pick Kaisch or the party will enter an extra candidate purely at the convention. \n\nSo basically, Trump and Cruz, jointly with overwhelming majority of the votes now it's a three horse race could both NOT be the nomination in favour of someone who dropped out months ago like Jeb Bush or Kaisch who has barely any votes in comparison. And the Republican Party desperately wants it. May be within the rules of the convention, but that is MASSIVE voter disenfranchisement ","Yes ,  I agree. But as much as I hate the RNC Establishment ( I am a Rand Paul supporter ), it is not really a case of voter disenfranchisement, is it?  It is often said that RNC and DNC are private bodies, and the public will definitely be able to vote in the general elections.","But if a huge majority of Republican voters say effectively say \"We want Trump\" and \"We want Cruz\", then the party says back \" We heard you, but here, vote for Jeb Bush, even though you didn't vote for him earlier and he dropped out as a result\". That's the definition of voter disenfranchisement  ","See, I agree with you in spirit. What I'm trying to say is, if the people can convince Trump/Cruz to run 3rd party ( if they are 'seized' of the nomination), then the people can vote for Trump/Cruz. Else vote for RNC/DNC/Libertarian/GreenParty/Write-in-someone. I agree that the contested convention will seem evil, maybe it is indeed evil (heck, I hate it) , but it is legal and unfortunately, right ( from the perspective of RNC's rights).","America and third parties doesnt really work because of the way the media, election system and funding works. Ok, this would be slightly different as they have had a lot of publicity during the primaries but still, it would be unlikely.\n\nAnyway, the issue is voter disenfranchisement. It's impossible to argue that effectively overruling the voters in NOT disenfranchisement as it is the definition of it. Legality of what they are doing is besides the issue. Its a moral issue, not a legal one\n","oh, BINGO!, my family think I'm a tin-hatter for muttering about Governments being mere mouthpieces for Big Money, but I know it's true.

Despite sending tens of thousands of soldiers over the past decade or so in support of their stupid wars. Losing hundreds of soldiers and spending tens if not hundreds of billions on them.\n\nBut people like Trump say Europe doesn't do anything, then people like Trump but even all the other politicians and Americans on the ground talk up Israel and how great they are and how America needs to do more for Israel. A country that not only takes billions in aid from the US but also hasn't actually done anything close to what Europe has done for the US in its entire existence. All major politicians and all major demographics in the US speak consistent on this issue with the exception of a very small minority so it's not just Trump.\n\nWhen the US tells us to fuck off, when they say Britain or Europe is weak and contributes nothing. Remember everything that was done over this entire WoT and the Cold War.\n\nIf they want Israel to be their only ally, let them fucking have it I say.

They'll triumphantly announce how weak they think Europe is and how Europe is constantly stabbing America in the back whilst soldiers are dying on the battlefields and billions are being spent ....right as they speak on their podiums, then they lap up Israel whilst Israel takes billions from them and contributes nothing.","&gt; A country that not only takes billions in aid from the US\n\nUS spends $3b a year defending Israel. US spends $200b a year defending Europe.\n\n&gt;but also hasn't actually done anything close to what Europe has done for the US in its entire existence.\n\nThat's not exactly an insult, most Americans believe Europe is the peak of human civilization after the US.\n\n&gt;If they want Israel to be their only ally, let them fucking have it I say.\n\nThe US is allied with almost everyone. Other than Syria, Lebanon &amp; Iran they're allied with all of the countries of the middle east and north Africa. Israel is the country America most criticises.

It's strange that the small amount of aid to Israel receives such disproportionate attention, would it be better for the US to let the only liberal country in the middle east get invaded and destroyed?","Like I said, the mentality in the US is that Europe does nothing for them. Despite spending billions on wars and (I know nobody cares but) actual lives lost too. Yet the American media, government and populace constantly likes to pretend that Europe never does anything for America and that Israel is the only true great ally. \n\nSo how many more dead soldiers and stupid wars and terror attacks does a country even need if it's still just going to be considered a worthless ally. The US offers nothing. Europe doesn't need to pretend to hate Russia so it has to pretend to need 200bn of US military aid so that the US can pretend to say Europe does nothing. \n\nAll whilst Americans talk about how worthless the world is despite the fact that so many non-Americans die fighting stupid American wars but the only country that doesn't do that, is the country that is considered the best ally.","I don't know where you're getting that the average American thinks of Israel as this great ally. To be perfectly honest he average American probably doesn't think of Israel much at all. As the other commenter said, most Americans would consider Europe to be Americas greatest allies, especially because huge portions of America have ancestry all over Europe. ","Realistically,  Americans per se don't care about Israel nearly as much as you'd think from watching the media here.  Politicians give it way more time than it deserves soley because every politician that spends money on Israel gets a chunk of it back in political donations.  To vote against anything Israel is to vote against yourself at the next election so most politicians are afraid to do it.\n\nJust one more way how unlimited campaign funds causes democratic elections to break down.","Maybe if we didn't have to keep breaking up Europe's little \"world\" wars we would respect them more.

I mean there are only two power presidents in the world, Putin and Obama.
