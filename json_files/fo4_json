When working with 3d assets utilizing blender, cinema4d, 3dsmax (the list goes on and on) the physics must be simulated and rendered. Simulation is exactly what you think, the process of calculating dynamics (using math none of us would ever want to do) and rendering is the calculation of light, materials, camera placement, motion and much more to determine what color pixel x of millions is (almost 1 million for one frame @ 1280x720.\nThe reason why it's not real time is its all done with the cpu. Video games utilize engines that preload and cache shaders, have already done the necessary calculations and have preset algorithms in place so that they can utilize a gpu to handle everything. Physics are still done on the cpu but video game physics aren't as accurate as fully simmed physics so they're less taxing. \nHope that helps...\n","It does, but what if you had physics with no shaders?

How did you learn about blender and how to use it? 2. What hardware is best to render something like your simulation? Thanks","Learning a program like Blender is kinda like trying to learn a game like World of Warcraft, except you start at level 100 and there wasn't a tutorial.\n\nYou have to strip it down to the basics and take it in bite sized pieces like how the interface works, how to manipulate objects in 3D space, etc.\n\nThe best way to do this is to simply set yourself small incremental goals and use Blender a lot. Watch tutorials and copy them. [This is a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHVYYMG3QVY); in the lower left corner it shows which hotkeys he uses and can give you a good idea of what features and keys get used most for moving objects and the camera around.\n\nWhen you get stuck try finding more specific info or tutorials about that issue, sometimes if you're **really** stuck, looking up the methods behind a feature can help, for example what does rigid body actually mean? what does convex hull collision mean?\n\nThe good news though, computer simulations are better-suited to work with very simple 3D models. Minimalistic designs can still be very good looking.\n\nAs for rendering, I used Blender's Cycles renderer which allows ray-tracing to be done on my graphics card. nVidia was the fastest at rendering and supported the most render features for a while but I hear AMD is catching up. Although rendering on your CPU isn't the end of the world if it's relatively new and high-end.\n\nMaking a render look *nice* is actually a skill-set itself separate from how technically good your render is(just look at the original Toy Story). Looking at references like how professionals light products or general real life lighting tutorials can mesh well with learning how lights work and look good inside a 3D program.\n\nLearning something new will always be frustrating but eventually the payoff will outweigh the pain. Hope this was helpful. :D","Thanks man really appreciate the reply will try this out.","\"Learning a program like Blender is kinda like trying to learn a game like World of Warcraft, except you start at level 100 and there wasn't a tutorial.\"\nI was a java web application programmer before I retired, which is probably one of, if not the most complicated system to learn.
