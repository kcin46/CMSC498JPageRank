","\"Internet customers in the UK are prohibited from accessing a range of web sites by default, because they have their Internet access filtered by their ISPs. The filtering program has applied to new ISP customers since the end of 2013, and has been extended to existing users on a rolling basis. A voluntary code of practice agreed by all four major ISPs[8] means that customers have to 'opt out' of the ISP filtering to gain access to the blocked content.[9] However, the complex nature of the active monitoring systems means that users cannot usually opt out of the monitoring and re-routing of their data traffic, something which may render their data security vulnerable. The range of content blocked by ISPs can be varied over time.[10] Categories blocked across the major ISPs include: Dating, Drugs, Alcohol and Tobacco, File sharing, Gambling, Games, Pornography, Nudity, Social networking, Suicide and Self-harm, Weapons and violence, Obscenity, Criminal Skills, Hate, Media Streaming, Fashion and Beauty, Gore, Cyberbullying, Hacking and Web-blocking circumvention tools.\"\n\nYou can technically opt-out if you're an adult.

It sounds like 90% of the internet is blocked.","IIRC you're given options to decide what exactly you want to block, like a firewall of sorts. Porn/nudity I believe is blocked by default if you don't say anything to your ISP. But from a previous article I read, the ISPs are suppose to notify you if a filter is going into effect and what do you want to do about it (for customers prior to 2013).

David Cameron first announced such legislation in July 2013[31][32] but default filtering was rejected at the September 2013 conference of the Liberal Democrats (the Coalition Government's minor partner)[33] and no Government legislation to this effect occurred during the 2010-15 Parliament.\"\n\n[Another says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_blocking_in_the_United_Kingdom#Mobile_Internet_blocking): \"All major UK [mobile] operators now voluntarily filter content by default.\"\n","&gt;They can't really block them as so many businesses rely on them.\n\nThats actually a good reason **to** block them -- so you can upsell people who just want to work from home on overpriced 'business packages' that they should not need.","Mothers are worthless.","Literally all hitlers.\n\n","\"wow thats what its like in america?? haha us british gentlemen have it *SO* much better here!\" ","The nanny state at its finest!","Fuck that shit.

Even if you opt out, you are stuck with the overhead of a few table lookups on giant tables (which likely aren't in an optimized SQL database at ALL).

The adult section isn't just nudie mags, it's anything that they deem to be offensive or bad in any way, including a lot of stuff you think is perfectly fine and innocent.  The adult section is clearly labeled but is right there with everything else and there is no stigma attached to going into it, because everybody knows the library is overzealous in what they label \"adult\".\n\nThat's the internet.  You can access anything and everything, and you are perfectly capable of deciding what you don't want to see, and you usually know ahead of time based on the link description or other factors, about what types of stuff you'll find.\n\nNow imagine the library doesn't just move the adult section, they hide it behind the counter, and video record you, and log each access, and you just feel awkward going in.  And lots of people come in and don't even know that it's there and so they don't even know to ask about it.  They are blocked from seeing information without knowing.  And less people go browsing there because it just feels more dirty to do it now.\n\nThat is a fundamental change in behavior that was created by the censorship.  Before that, people browsed freely and didn't think twice.  Now they are missing information, sometimes without knowing it, and when they find out and want to access it, they are burdened and recorded and made to feel like it's somehow different and somehow wrong.\n\nIt is a *chilling effect* on how you think and act.\n\nIn an opt-in system, the *default* is freedom, the ability to access what you want without burden or hassle or shame, you are choosing to place restrictions upon yourself for your own benefit, because you are an adult capable of making your own decisions.  In an opt-out system, you are treated as a child and that needs to be cared for, and it is specifically designed to make the social taboo and default be that access to this content is not appropriate.  It is control and manipulation.","Why do you think the internet should be treated differently from the real world?","First, I'm curious where in my post I make any points that require the internet be different from the real word.  I disagree with a lot of real world censorship as well.\n\nThat said, you are correct, and I do think the internet should be treated differently, because it fundamentally *is* different.  The internet has the ability to be even *more* open and free than the real world, and even though that comes with some bad things, on the whole, it's a HUGE net benefit to society at large.\n\nBad people will always use technology to do bad things, but that doesn't make the tech bad, and it also doesn't mean we shouldn't still have unfettered access to that tech -- the bad people may just be a hit we take because the benefit of the tech is so enormous.\n\nSoftware like Tor for example enables people to run hidden services and to browse the web anonymously, and of course a lot of bad people use that for doing bad things.  But it also enables people in repressive countries to secretly communicate and contact journalists and have a safe area they can communicate.  I think that's an acceptable tradeoff and that the good outweighs the bad.","&gt; First, I'm curious where in my post I make any points that require the internet be different from the real word.\n\nI inferred it. Hey it's late here. You make some good points. But at the end of the day I'm just disagreeing with you about the fundamental issue that I don't see an opt out filter on your internet that is part of the sign up process as a big deal. I also have no issues if the government want to proactively try and remove illegal content from the net such as illegal porn or the ability to buy services or goods that are illegal in the real world. The internet shouldn't be above the law imo and if something requires id or a license or is illegal in the real world then the same rules should apply to those partcular items or activities on the net as well.\n\n Anyway we're in danger of going off on a massive tangent here that I don't want to get involved in. As a whole I'm against censorship in the media and online. Your points about repressive countries censoring content and communication is spot on.  I just don't think comparing the internet in somewhere like north korea is at all comparable to an opt out porn filter that is set as part of the sign up process with your ISP. I just think we just have different opinions on where the line is and I don't consider an opt out filter that big a deal in principal. \n\nIf it helps explain my position a bit better if the filter was mandatory AND you couldn't opt out then I'd have issues. Even more so if non illegal \\ age restricted items were filtered or items of political sensitivity that doesn't fit the current narrative. I think it's important for me to reiterate that I'm arguing in favor for an opt out porn filter that you can opt out at sign up with your ISP. I'm not arguing in favor of becoming some sort of North Korean \\ Chinese black out on anything the government doesn't want you to know about which I'm guessing where a lot of the fear in this topic is coming from.","I certainly understand your views, and I also know I'm a bit die-hard all or nothing about it.  I have a great fear of the first steps of censorship slipping down that slippery slope at a very fast rate, and on top of that I lean more heavily on the \"all speech even hate speech and other horribleness should be allowed\" side of things, so even \"reasonable\" things often aren't acceptable to me.  And of course, content blocking, even if you can opt-out, I obviously don't care for.  (Since you can always opt-out by simply not visiting the site to begin with.  Have you ever typed a URL you wanted to visit and then been blocked and *not* been annoyed?  If you wanted to not see the site, you wouldn't have tried to visit it!)  I strongly feel the default needs to be free and open and then you must opt-in for censorship.\n\nBut your views are completely understandable and perfectly fair.","I'm not sure why I'm getting down voted for this.

My friend is my fraternity brother from college and at the time of the story was a fairly high ranking civilian contractor for the military that works on an American base.  About 2 years before the day of the story, he was cleaning up his kids playroom and had extra model clay and thought it would be a random idea to make a fake looking bomb with red curly wires, a clock, etc.  This was of course before 9/11 because as much as an idiot as my friend is, he would never think of doing this in present times.  Anyway, he had brought it to work to show his friends (he is a scientist and thought his friends would get a kick out of it).   He threw it in his desk and ultimately forgot about it.  \n\nOK so fast forward a few years later and my friend gets promoted to an even higher post.  He is cleaning out his desk and boxing things up and heads out to lunch off base.\n\nYou know where this is going.  He gets back to base and at the vehicle checkpoint to enter base there is a swarm of military police.  Upon showing his ID the MPs swarm his car (he is with 3 or 4 other people) and they tell him, with hands on guns but still holstered, \"sir you need to come with us\".\n\nMy friend tells me he shits a brick because he has no idea wtf is going on, and the MPs drive him in a jeep across base and as they approach his lab he sees fire engines, hazmat team, police, and the entire building and surrounding buildings evacuated.  All of a sudden it hits him.  He remembered unpacking the desk into boxes and left his \"toy\" visible in an open box.\n\nHe starts explaining himself and at first nobody believes him.  But ultimately the situation deescalates and returns to normal.\n\nThe next day, my friend is called to the office of the Base Commander and I am told the Base Commander looked him in the eyes with doors closed, allowed my friend to tell his story,  and the response was a calm \"what the fuck is wrong with you?\"  He was told about the cost of the shut down, the back story of what had transpired, and told to never allow something like that to happen again.  The Base Commander left it at that, figuring my friend was an idiot but otherwise spared him.\n\nThe best part of this story is that my friend is brilliant.  He holds a PhD, was very high ranking at the base, and now some 20 years later has been promoted very very high up in the hierarchy.  But I knew him in college when we were stupid and before he was a high ranking important dude.   So the story remains very special to me as a favorite.\n\nI remind him of this story at least once every 2 years.","That's part of the problem.  Being smart, intelligence- that has no bearing on whether or not the consequences are figured out.  \"Who in their right mind would build a real bomb?\"- but fakes they're OK.  Everyone will know it's a fake because real bombs don't look like they do on TV... etc.  \n\nI've no doubt your friend is definitely up there in the intelligence compartment- the 'common sense' or 'societal expectations' isn't a requirement for intelligence.  Fortunately the MPs weren't trigger happy...","18 Intelligence 6 Wisdom","The issue is in American culture if you're in charge you can't just say \"I'm an expert on these things and I *made the executive decision* that the toy did not pose a threat.\" ","Or maybe smart people overestimate dumb people who in reality can't figure simple shit out.

They started knocking on other doors to see if anyone knew where I was located and my friend Al says yeah I know him. They explained about the beer and tried to give it to Al, who's only 20 and a naturally suspicious person. So he declined. They insisted. He declined again and they said they'd leave the beer there for me to pick up. \n\nSome time later I get a call from Al explaining a bunch of SPs are still trying to give him, an underage airman living in a dorm where you can't drink by order of the base commander, a case of beer.

This is despite the fact that in the United States since 2001, twice as many terrorist attacks were by right-wing Americans than by Muslims according to [NAF](http://securitydata.newamerica.net/extremists/deadly-attacks.html). You'd think Donald would want to ban the most dangerous groups to keep America safe but no, he's simply Islamophobic.\n\nTrump finds Mexicans to be dangerous people also. I'm sure you already read his famous quote: [\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/16/full-text-donald-trump-announces-a-presidential-bid/) Mexicans are first and foremost rapists or criminals or smugglers to him. Sure, he thinks some may be good, but to say that Mexico is actively sending bad people into the United States is ludicrous. That's where his xenophobia comes into play. \n\nAnother thought, if Trump wanted to secure the borders wouldn't he also want a wall on the Canadian border? That may be a little racism although it could be argued.\n\nI think we can all agree that Trump is sexist, I don't even have to get into that.\n\nAll of these ideas are violent and promote the hatred and inequality of people of different religions, ethnicities, and sexes. As long as a person who strives for a magnitude of power promotes these ideas, they are a threat to the people whom will be affected negatively by the ideas and need to be resisted. I also am of the belief that capitalism is an oppressive and terrible economic system, which Donald is clearly a fan of considering his massive amount of wealth. ","&gt;Says who?\n\nSays him you dumb shit. His campaign manager tells EVERYONE to protest outside in the area reserved for peaceful protesting. His rallies are private property, therefore you are trespassing and infringing his rules and are allowed to be booted out.\n\n&gt;I know, that's a real crime. Just think of the horrors of that inconvenience!\n\nClassic. And you wonder why the protestors are booted out and told to fuck off.\n\n&gt;So Trump supporters like Trump because some people don't want Trump and his ideology to have any power at all? I think they like him because they enjoy hearing xenophobic statements and hate anyone that is different than them.\n\nYou're such a cuck it's unbelievable. \"hate anyone that is different than them,\" you have completely summarized left wing identity politics. Trump is popular because he doesn't bullshit things and people are becoming sick of the current political establishment.\n\n&gt;Trump finds Mexicans to be dangerous people also\n\nAbsolutely knew this would come up. First off, notice the line \"And some, I assume, are good people,\" meaning there are some who are probably good decent human beings (don't think I need to explain this). And did you know [80% of girls who cross the border illegally are raped by the men they travel with?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/central-america-migrants-rape_n_5806972.html).

[America's population of muslims is integrated and very moderate compared to the world](http://www.meforum.org/4218/the-moderation-of-american-muslims). Of course there haven't been a lot of attacks.

He holds the same beliefs as the rest of the establishment. \n\n&gt;just no ignorance towards the facts\n\nBut there is an ignorance towards how to use those facts. When things like crossing the border or smuggling drugs are illegal, the only people who are willing to cross the border or smuggle drugs are poor people. They need money and or a better life and are willing to do those things because they have no other choice. With crime and poverty comes a lack of education which is the reason why the rape rate is so high and why the murder rate is so high. People who rape and murder are products of an improper education, improper mental healthcare, and poverty.\n\n&gt;Muslims are 23 times more likely to rape in Sweden, and a crime involving a muslim immigrant happens practically everyday in some European country\n\nLike in the response to your statistics about illegal immigrants, the Muslim people who enter Sweden are products of their environment and if you can't tell, the Middle East isn't a great place to live, just like Mexico.\n\n&gt;Also, he never said banning Islam completely, he said banning Muslim entry, which is understandable considering how Europe, Africa, and the Middle East have gone haywire with Islamic radicalism and crime rates\n\nI don't think banning anyone from entering a country is understandable.

Would he just ask every brown person at the border if they practice Islam?\n\n&gt;Actually, please go into that if you may\n\n[This](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/18-real-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women_us_55d356a8e4b07addcb442023) article directly references that quote so you may find it helpful. By the way, a person can say they aren't sexist but can still say sexist things. You do realize that?\n\n&gt;Capitalism gives everyone the chance if they work hard enough\n\nNot if they grow up in a poor background. How is someone growing up in low income housing, working a difficult minimum wage job supposed to compete? The world shouldn't be difficult for the less fortunate. There shouldn't be a less fortunate, the world can move past classes.\n\n&gt;The whole point of a capitalist free market is that it forces businesses to compete against each other\n\nThis is code for paying workers the least you can, selling products for as high as you can, getting rid of pollutants as cheaply as possible which destroys the environment tremendously, and profits going directly to those who did not labor to earn those profits. \n\nWe can move beyond capitalism. The profit incentive that causes starvation and low wages doesn't have to exist. Socialism is more than capable of ensuring no one starves in a world where there is enough food and shelter for everyone. I enjoy having complete worker autonomy and that is impossible under capitalism. You will always have a master under capitalism.\n\n","Ugh you are an insufferable fuck.

The countries you're thinking of as socialist or communist are, I assume, the Soviet Union and China. They are considered state capitalist by many because the undemocratic states of those countries took over the means of production leaving the workers with no power over their work, the opposite of socialism which is capitalism. Socialism is worker control of the means of production. Communism is a form of socialism which is stateless, moneyless, classless, and propertyless. The countries were definitely not communist although a case could be made for them being socialist at times. Even if you consider those countries socialist (which they really weren't), the atrocities which happened in those countries were not caused by what economic system in place. They were caused by power hungry dictators like Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. The Soviet Union and China are, if anything, a sign that power cannot be monopolized by small groups of people like the wealthy under capitalism and the state under failed attempts at communism.

But Hitler's support is what made him Hitler. So I *do* hate Muslims solely because they're Muslims, they keep the Islamic doctrines alive. Remember, associating yourself with a religion is a **choice**. It's like **choosing** to be a white supremacist and then claiming \"Naziphobia!\", or \"Hate the game, not the player!\", when called out on your racism. Islamophobia is justified in my eyes because of this, it's inherently different from racism.\n\nNow before you call me out on anything, I just want to say that;\n\na) I know that some people don't choose their religion. Babies born in the Islamic state will most likely be converted to extremists because that's how they were raised, and due to a lack of education, they don't know any better.

I hate the ones that escaped their hellhole, and now want to turn our society into their hellhole.\n\nb) I know that there are 'progressive' Muslims who don't strictly follow their religion. Those who condemn the Quran's intolerance, and those who even fight for womens' rights and LGBT rights. But these guys are hardly Muslims, they're Muslims by association.

Because I guess not being a dickhead these days means you're one or the other.\n\nSaying /r/the_donald is a xenophobic shithole doesn't mean I want to suck Muhammad's dick.  I don't like radical Islam either, and I don't want tons of Muslim immigrants in the U.S.  This is mostly Europe's problem right now, and it's not even close to a big issue in the U.S.  Blaming Muslims and Mexicans for America's laundry list of problems just shows the lack of education of Trump's supporters.\n\nIt's hilarious how not wanting Muslim hate to dominate the conversation automatically means I fucking love the religion.  Try again.","&gt;when they spew so much hate about Muslims\n\n\nYou do realize that the above statement in the context of your post is deriding Trump supporters for the act of spewing hate at Muslims. You are taking issue with the problem we (Trump supporters) have with Muslims and the derision we profess at them.\n\n\nSo, you're issue could be one of two potential scenarios;\n\n\n1) You take issue with anyone or any group that derides another weather legitimate or not. This means you just want everyone to be \"nice\" to each other.\n\n\n2) You take issue with the actual derision aimed at Muslims. This is indicative of an individual that supports or at least accepts the positions of Islam and it's Muslim followers. \n\n\nYet you then make the statement:\n\n&gt;I don't like radical Islam either\n\n\nThere is no such thing as \"radical Islam\". There is only Islam and its teachings and the adherents to its teaching. Supporting documentation: http://40.media.tumblr.com/3dbde8d5a74e6a433b9741da74e9e528/tumblr_nh05ctbOev1qdc32wo1_1280.jpg\n\n\nYou also make the statement;\n\n\n&gt;Saying /r/the_donald is a xenophobic shithole\n\n\nYou accuse r/The_Donald of being xenophobic. You either misunderstand the meaning of xenophobia or are purposefully misconstruing the meaning to suit your contentions. The definition of Xenophobia is: *\"having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries.\"*\n\nI challenge you to find posts on r/The_Donald where supporters indicate hatred for *middle easterners*. You see, Islam and Muslims are not a race and do not come from one specific country. Trump supporters take issue with MUSLIMS and ISLAM which is NOT a race, but a RELIGION and as such no such xenophobia is being propagated. \n\n\n","I really enjoyed this comment because it's just interesting to see your mental gymnastics and how you people actually justify your warped view of reality.  Hell, you can take all of your studies and your little graphs and whatnot, and lob them at me all day.  Go ahead an make yourself feel like you're making some sort of point.  It's just the classic conservative argument - \"I have not actually studied, or had any formal first-hand experience with what I'm talking about, but check out this rhetoric that I've compiled based on things I heard in my echo chamber.\"  Someone such as yourself actually feeling like you're educating someone on Islam is fucking adorable.\n\nAnd I don't adhere to the typical \"liberal leftist cuck SJW\" narrative that you people have created to justify your constant hate speech.  I have no love for Muslims and I don't support accepting refugees.  Hell, if I had it my way, we'd flatten the all of the land ISIS stands on without regard for human life.  Fuck those people.  However, the fact that you degenerate, retarded fucks allow this bullshit topic to dominate your political conversation, and want a buffoon like Donald J.

If you are looking at 80's laminate wood cabinets and shitty color tone sinks, you will significantly raise your house value by renovating to something new and neutral.

If you are reasonably handy or have a friend who can help with stuff like simple plumbing you will save a TON which is cash back in your pocket.

The film was mismarketed and bombed, and while it did well on DVD, presumably not well enough to loosen the purse-strings.","Netflix funded a daredevil series, and that film was a commercial and critical bomb.

","IIRC, it's because the guy that greenlit the show was either fired or quit before the show started airing.

Urban could be in these episodes for decades.\n\nI am Dutch. I was in San Francisco, just 100 meters off Turk Street in the Tenderloin in 2012, visiting for a few weeks. I was feral, high on several types of stimulants (modafinil, ritalin) and hypercharged. The days were sweltering hot, and I was just in transition, on Progynova and in a haze of adventurous spirit. I visit the Singularity University, Google Campus, Land's end, Chinatown, the whole lot. Then I noticed the premiere of Dredd in the cinema. So I went, late in the evening.\n\nI got kinda deep in the movie. *I forgot I was in the US during te movie*. So halfway the movie I was asking myself, \"where did I park my bike\" and I was thinking about getting some Showarma before going home. The movie blew me away, it was amazing. Then at 0100 at night I walked out of the cinema, out of full DREDD immersion and in to the sprawling hellish Dystopia that SanFran has become, hearing crazy homeless people howl from the tenderloin. *That was some surreal trip*.

Even my friend who is the biggest 200AD and Dredd fan didn't see it at the cinema and I took me to show him a couple of scenes before he watched it. And then he regretted not seeing it sooner. I don't know if it was just bad marketing or what, but this has been the case with so many people. Dredd is a fantastic film and deserves so much more respect and recognition than it got.

Interestingly, written at a highly transitional time for every single band member.  Nicks and Buckingham were in an extremely turbulent relationship which was coming to an end, John and Christine McVie had divorced and were barely speaking, and Fleetwood had just learned that his wife had been having an affair (to divorce soon afterwards).  I think it was the personal upheaval that caused them to put so much of themselves into each song.  Phenomenal album from start to finish.","if you listen to Go Your Own Way, its about the turbulent relationship that Nicks and Buckingham had.\n ","If I recall correctly Nicks began to hate Buckingham for the line\n\n\"Packing up, shacking up is all you wanna do\"\n\nHere's the exert from Wikipedia, it tells so much about the band at that time:\n\n\"Stevie Nicks asked Buckingham to remove the lyrics \"Packing up, shacking up is all you wanna do\", but Buckingham refused. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Nicks gave her thoughts on the matter. \"I very much resented him telling the world that 'packing up, shacking up' with different men was all I wanted to do. He knew it wasn't true. It was just an angry thing that he said. Every time those words would come onstage, I wanted to go over and kill him. He knew it, so he really pushed my buttons through that. It was like, 'I'll make you suffer for leaving me.' And I did.\"","The first three albums that ushered in the Buckingham Nicks Era of Fleetwood Mac were all truly astonishing.  Of those, Tusk is the one that really captures what I love most of this incarnation.  As far as \"The Chain\" goes, there is an incredible demo of this that has a slow instrumental build; highly recommended.","Holy shit, yes! Everyone likes to put Tusk down but I think it is truly some of their best songwriting especially for Stevie (even though the album was Lindsey's baby).","Big shout out for The Ledge, mainly because of its bonkers production: http://youtu.be/DuQFnVKrHuY\n\n","My 4 year old knows Tusk by the first bar and runs to the speaker!

I was dangerous when the chain came on while I was at the lights","that bass solo...","*riff","yeah I suppose it's a little light to be a full solo eh","That's how I discovered this song as a kid. ","That seems like a strange choice of song for racing. \"If you don't love me now/you will never love me again/speeds top at 360 kmph\"","They make it look far more exciting than it is","With how 2016 is going so far someone needs to find Stevie and hide her. Just hide her. ","I'm alive and well, no worries ","Will you marry me?","Don't even speak it oh god ","I'm more worried about John McVie.","Do you feel safe for anyone in fleetwood Mac?

Gold Dust Woman is the best song on the album IMO","You Make Lovin' Fun for me!","Hell yes. The Chain is just finishing, and you're thinking \"How can they top this?\"\n\nThen the bass kicks in. Oh lawd.","I know.  Best part of the song is the bass solo followed by the all out rock out ending","Underdog pick. I like it.","Songbird is one of the most beautiful songs ever written to me and what I think is the best song on Rumours. It may be my 2nd favorite Fleetwood Mac song of all time (next to Beautiful Child on the Tusk album) but, seriously, the whole album is magic.","I agree, I love that song the most. I got to go to their show when they came to Phoenix a couple of years ago and Christine had rejoined their tour. I didn't think they were going to play it but it was one of the very last songs they played. She still sings it just as beautifully.","Dreams is the best song on the album though.","You sure are spelling \"Never Going Back Again\" in a weird way. \n\nJokes aside, that's what makes it so good, you could ask a bunch of people what their favorite song on the album is and get 11 different responses. ","Lol I agree though. Never Going Back Again is one of the greatest pop songs of all time","That is by far my favorite Fleetwood Mac song","Who the hell is picking I Don't Want to Know?\n\nIt's a fine song and all, but it's a big step down from the others.","I love it! Not only is it an essential piece in the album (something up-beat in the end of the album) but it's also a simple rock-song whose rhythm I love.\n\nSure it's a big step downwards lyrically but I think it makes up for it with it's composition.","Yeah that's all good, but...favorite?","Favorite is a bit of a strong word, but 'I Don't' was the song that made me listen to Rumours, so for me it's special at the least.","I don't agree about that particular song, but I understand where you're coming from.","You spelled Second Hand News wrong.","Doesn't mean it has to be his favorite. Though. ","Silver Springs would've been the best song on the album if it hadn't been left off in my opinion. The Chain is tops for me otherwise. ","Gypsy and Big Love are pretty good too","Dreams was almost cut ","Those 3 voices came together so well in this song.","Tango in the night was a fantastic concert, I saw them in Detroit in the late 80's. All their stuff is gold. ","Ugh, I freakin' love that album. I envy you that got to see them in concert ;(","do you remember?","...the 21st night of September?","THE FACE OF A PRETTY GIRL","Actually though the solo in that song is so good","It was the best concert I ever experienced!","One of the greatest rock albums ever","It defined the summer of 77 for me.  \n\nHad a vinyl and 8-track copy, we wore that tape out playing songs over and over, particularly this one.","This album was the first tape my parents ever bought and the also wore it out playing it so much in the car. I did the same things by with my Joshua Tree album in the 80s lol","I was born in 77 and this my favorite album of all time.  I heard it in the womb, when I was a child, through adolescence and into adulthood.  I still listen to it regularly.  The Chain is my favorite song, but the whole album is perfection.","Heard this song watching The Americans the other day, they played it during a snatch and grab op, a lot of visceral emotion occurred in that scene, it was all so excellent.","The Americans also did a particularly good job with Fleetwood Mac's \"Tusk\" in the pilot episode.","That scene combined with that music is what hooked me on The Americans","The Chain and Tainted Love scenes are two of my favourites in The Americans. ","Their live performances of this song are usually better than the album version, imo. Like on the opening of 'The Dance'. Needs good headphones with some decent  bass to get full effect.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/lpVCL00fPAc","The Dance is how I first got into Fleetwood Mac years ago after searching through all of my mom's CDs. I loved it so much I bought the DVD. It's such an amazing live performance.","Me too! I basically grew up on the live album. My parents had that on CD, but most of the others were on records and i wasn't allowed to use the record player as a kid. Listened to The Dance so much that I prefer the live versions of most of the songs now. The live version of this song might be my favorite from Fleetwood Mac altogether. ","How the hell is that audience sitting down during this performance. I'd be standing ON my seat. ","I was a teenager when The Dance first aired, I think on VH1, and it was the year I'd first learned to play guitar. I was into mostly metal and industrial at the time, but had an ear for classic rock too, so I'd heard of Fleetwood Mac but never really listened to them.\n\nI watched this and I was hooked from the intro of The Chain all the way through the end. I remember seeing this and Big Love later on in the show and thinking, \"How the hell does he do that?\" I learned about Travis picking and practiced for years until I could finally nail both of those songs. This live show and album completely changed my personal playing style as a musician, and definitely hooked me into a more eclectic musical fandom where I was willing to draw inspiration from anything.\n\nThanks for posting this! Lindsey will forever make my list as one of the greatest guitarists of all-time, and most definitely in the top of the list of most underrated guitarists of all time.\n\n[Big Love, from The Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZp76M4NGc)","The bass solo is amazing!","John in such an under appreciated genius. I think he is one of the best bass players of all time but I may be a tad bias since they're my favorite band.","Every bass player I've ever played with has whipped this one out at least once in rehearsal.","Their song [Rhiannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_aYibUx1B8) and their live rendition of [Landslide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK2HAfb3rC0) are also fantastic","I was so annoyed the other day when i went to listen to both of those songs only to find I don't have a copy of \"Fleetwood Mac\" on LP...\n\nThat album plus Rumours are fantastic. ","\"The Dance\" is one of the best live albums of all time.  \n\nI grew up on that album, many hours riding with my parents absolutely SCREAMING along to [Tusk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrRVW-p8SJ8).  I can't even imagine how badass it must have been in person to see Mick Fleetwood come back out on stage and start banging that shit out.\n\nEdit: [This was what they played next in case anyone was wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgwRYjDhK_E)\n\nAlso amazing: [From their 2003 show in Boston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dff2XCh3Ass)  - Solidified Lindsey Buckingham as one of the most badass dudes alive IMO.  (As if [40 years of such performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5kOzGwsHXw) didn't do that already)\n\nEdit 2: Fuck it, here's more Fleetwood Mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRu7Pt42x6Y","It is THE best concert video I've ever seen.  I believe Stevie described the concert as, \"As magic as it gets...it was.\" I tend to agree.  That whole performance is amazing.  ","They're both always amazing live as is Silver Springs (but especially on The Dance). Landslide is going to be my father-daughter dance song for my wedding in July. Had to incorporate The Mac in there somehow!! :)","If you are too cool for Fleetwood Mac, you might just be too cool.","Saw them in Perth last year whilst it was pouring down rain, was fantastic, thoroughly enjoyed it.","This has always been my favorite song. I heard it for the first time while camping with a bunch of hooligans. Great introduction to music.","This one is great, but my favorites are Never Going Back Again and Gold Dust Woman. ","If you like this, try the live version with the amazing looks between Nicks and Buckingham.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGykwC0fdJ4","Taking Dawn's cover is really good:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6PNZLehuGU","[Bonus - The (2) Chain(z)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtah3MqtdXU)\n\n(Fleetwood Mac &amp; 2 Chainz Mashup)","I was surprised by how good this cover version by Cody Frost on this year's UK the Voice was:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=18ViAP9rf_Y","Holy shit that was really good...","I came here to say the same thing.

Gotta thank my grandad for getting me into Fleetwood Mac about a decade ago, still yet to seem them live because i got sick the day of the show near me on the last UK tour.","I remember being in the car with my Mom listening to this. ","I just got an old pressing of the rumours vinyl, just amazing when you listen straight through it. ","This is one of my girlfriends favourite songs to have a drink to. She told me this after I told her one of mine was Dreams. I lucked in.","My favorite Saturday afternoon jam. \n\nFleetwood Mac always gets me going. ","Good old Steamy Nicks.","to the day it reminds me of damon hill in his williams car in formula one,the bridge used to be the opening music of F1 on the BBC when i was a kid. ","favorite part of 2015 was randomly hearing this on the radio in a heavy rainstorm just driving down the 5 in California. ","I wish music like this was still in fashion ... M83 tried to use this type of vibe in their new album, but it fell a little flat.","I'm pretty sure The Pixies based their entire sound on the outro of this song.","Bummmm Bum Bum BUM Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bummmmmm","That guitar solo is so damn good.","Oh, god, I love this song. My favorite is definitely the version off The Dance, though. Actually, The Dance is probably my absolute favorite Fleetwood Mac album ever.   \n\nMy best friend and I used to listen to it constantly. Her wedding song was actually Big Love (the guitar work on that song is nothing short of incredible). I remember that her parents used to make fun of us constantly because it was more their generation’s music than ours.  ","I feel like posting any song off of Rumours in this subreddit is like cheating haha ","Not sure if someone has already mentioned this but for those of you who love the Rumours album and this song in particular, check out the super deluxe album release and the demo version of The Chain. It's much different--only Stevie; acoustic. The riff in what we now know as The Chain is featured in a song that Christine sang, called Keep Me There. ","That bass line tho ","I cannot stop listening to this song! Plus im a huge fan of 80's music, classic rock, 80's pop, generally any 80's music especially Fleetwood Mac!","It's amazing that this album came out in 77, at that!  Rumours was so ahead of its time for sure.  ","Fleetwood Mac has been my favorite band since I was 15 years old (now 28) and I was so amazingly fortunate to get to see them live about 3 years ago. Gah! They're just so amazing. I still enjoy the music they're putting out more recently but nothing compares to Rumours. It's an untouchable album imo.","I've been a fan since I was about 15, too, though I'm a few years older than you (wocka wocka). I often joke that my memorabilia collection is my kids' college fund, but it's a joke because I can't see myself selling anything (I specialize in artwork/photography and records - I've even got all the old bootleg albums from the 70s). I've seen Stevie solo 5 times, Lindsey solo once, and the Mac as a whole twice. Perfection every time. I even got Lindsey to sign my Tusk lithograph - next to Stevie's Rhiannon painting, it is my most prized piece.","I've collected all of their LPs (and some before Lindsey, Stevie, and Christine joined) and a few of the their old posters but besides that I only have current concert/fan shirts. I am completely blessed to have such a sweet fiance who got me Fleetwood Mac tickets for our first Christmas together 3 years ago (which he always says he set the bar too high lol) and it was literally one of the highlights of my life. As soon as they started to perform I immediately broke into tears because I thought I'd never get the chance to see them. Of course, Christine wasn't with them at that concert and she rejoined shortly after we saw them (which is a bummer since Songbird is one of my favorite songs) but it was still amazing and they went for around 3 1/2 hours!!","\"Oh Well\" is the only Fleetwood Mac song I ever liked. That bassline was fucking sick. The rest of their music reminds me of all the other soft rock they played at my orthodontist's office in the early '90s. ","That's because that was a completely different band. The original line up, fronted by Peter Green, with Danny Kirwan joining later, was outselling both the Stones and The Beatles. Check out \"Rattlesnake Shake\", and \"The Green Manalishi\"  from *Live in Boston* to listen to them in their prime. ","\"Man of the world\" is also absolutely sickening song","I can't believe that slipped my mind, it's one of my favourites!","The night is so black that the darkness cooks","**DUH DE DUH DE DUH, DUH DUH**","That makes a lot of sense. I never understood why a band capable of such awesomeness wiild spend decades being not very awesome. Thanks for the info.","No problem! \n\nThe reason for the change in line up was essentially Green leaving for disputed reasons, Jeremy Spencer running off to join a cult (Children of God in LA I believe), and Kirwan becoming an alcoholic and uncooperative. There was a period that straddled the pop and the blues iterations which featured Bob Welch and Weston also.","The reason for the change in line up was essentially Green leaving for disputed reasons.......\n\nThis makes me so sad, I believe if Green hadn't have took that trip he'd have been recognised as one of the best, some have all the technique but no emotion, the opening of \"need your love so bad\" gets me everytime, same  as \"I loved another woman\"\n\n\"He's the only one who gave me the cold sweats\" ","Fleetwood Mac was much better before they got the chicks. Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.","I like to just think of them as two separate, awesome groups that shared a common name.  Kinda the opposite of Jefferson Airplane/Starship","For the life of me, I will never understand how this sub works.","That's okay. You'll be okay.","Why have I never heard of this band? I've been listening to my local classic rock radio station for years and never once heard of them. \n\nPeople keep mentioning *Rhiannon*. If that song is by Fleetwood Mac, then it's the only song of theirs I know since the station plays it like 20 times a week.\n\nAnyone recommend any of their albums? Other than *Rumours*, it's been mentioned in this thread multiple times.","Rhiannon was on the Fleetwood Mac (self titled) album. It is by Fleetwood Mac.  I find it crazy you've never heard of Fleetwood Mac.  My guess would be, you've heard a lot more of them than you probably recognize.  I suggest their greatest hits album and work from there. \n","There was a great version on the UK voice this year. I'm too stupid to link it sorry ","Hands up all those who only listen to the part of the song they use in formula 1 towards the end coz that bit is awesome but the rest of the song is kinda \"meh\""],["Greatest day of my life was spent at the Hatch Shell with 100,000 other people listening to them play their \"farewell\" concert.","Even though Chad forgot the words to the second verse -__- lol\n\nI was there too!","Me three! Awesome show/experience. It doesn't feel that long ago but I also remember it being the day after the first Boston MySpace party (yeah that was a thing) which makes me realise it was a long time ago now.","\"Hold on now fellas back it up for a minute...\" As a then-14 year-old obsessed with Dispatch, going to that show was pretty much the greatest day of my life. Good times","The water bottle fight was one of the most cool things I've seen in person.","That's right! I have a great pic of that. A couple idiots threw glass though and some people went to the hospital. ","One of those bands that are great in the studio, but just phenomenal live. So happy they have a lot of their discography on the live albums they've released.","Not sure if you've listened to the newest live release (Ain't No Trip to Cleveland) but it fully lives up to their (very high) standards. Love the live versions of their newer songs.","I have and I fully agree. Actually made a pretty lengthy trip to Chicago to see them live shortly after Ain't No Trip to Cleveland was released because I was so into it.","Greatest day of my life was when they came back and played at Red Rocks. Holy guacamole, what a show. ","I was there as well. Absolutely insane show. ","Me too! Drove from Southern California for it - it was out of this world.","I remember that concert well. It was the summer after my senior year in high school. I remember getting close to the concert, hearing all the people, but couldn't see them because it was at the top of a hill. I remember getting to the top of the hill and looking out at a sea of people and just thinking \"woaaah.\"\n\nI was with some buddies and a few girls. One of the girls, who was a little overweight asked me to put her on my shoulders. I remember in my head thinking... really? Is she serious? I tried. I toughed it out as long as I could. I think I lasted 3 minutes before my legs starting shaking and sweat was profusely pouring out of me.\n\n\nI also remember people started throwing bottles. And I mean everywhere. Just bottles flying like crazy. Even glass bottles here and there which freaked me out. They almost stopped the show like 3 times cause of it.\n\nGood show. We all thought they were kidding about retiring, but figured it was the perfect excuse for a road trip. I mean who spends so many years building up an audience. Living out of your van for years and years doing any and every show possible. And when the fruits of your efforts start to finally pay off and you are hitting it big. Boom, retire. Didn't make sense. Anyways, good show, awesome band, still in regular rotation on my pandora stations. K, I'm done.

Maybe 30 of us in there. Sat 3 feet from them. One of my favorite shows.","All three of them were singers. The 3 part harmonies are what make them one of my favorite bands. But yeah State Radio is pretty good.","Chadwick Stokes is even more recent. He had an album last year","Chad stokes is such a cool guy.  His newest album \"the horse comanche\" is really good. If you like dispatch I'd recommend it (or anything else he's done in chandwick, SR , or dispatch) ","Right Me Up and Riddle In London Town are some of my favorites. ","I'm a big fan of Man in the Hall and Mountain.  MitH has a really good groove to it. ","If you like politically-driven songs, Camilo, Fight No More, Gunship, Gang of Thieves, people to people, and the state and I -- are all fantastic. Yes I had to list them all. There are so many other good ones, too.\n\nI learned about State Radio by loving Camilo the first time I heard it. The songs you mentioned were the very next ones I listened to.\n\nSaw them at the Hotel Congress in Tucson, AZ. Was awesome.","Bohemian Grove is my favorite.","I'd say I like Gunship Politico or Fall of The American Empire better, but Bohemian Grove is the song that got me into the band. ","Definitely the best song off that album, but I'd say *Us Against the Crown* was flawless start to finish.","State Radio is also now on an indefinite hiatus of sorts, sadly.","Ya, Mike gave it up to work in finance (motherfucker had an MBA or something, who knew?) and they said they'd continue with someone else on drums, but I'm pretty sure it's just kinda over.\n\nIt's a shame because they were damn good, not just \"the guy from Dispatch's other band.\"","I met these guys! Mike's gf was living at my house and they all hung out in my back yard. I had a drum set he messed around on. I am a huge Dispatch/State Radio fan. I also saw Dispatch at their reunion tour maybe 5 years ago in Boston. My favorite concert I havebeen to.","Chuck's out too, unfortunately. I have a really bad feeling we won't see anything from the SR we know and love ever again. it sucks. ","Damn. Well then there's no reason to release or tour under that name and not just Chad Stokes. Reunion tour (or show, more likely) will happen one day.\n","I just saw Chuck tweet today to Chad and Matt about a fan begging for a reunion. They rock so fucking hard I need to get that back in my life. I love chad solo too but its too soft sometimes\n","Which doesn't really mean much with these guys. Dispatch have played like 6 \"last shows\". ","Also if you want State Radio's folksy - ballad style equivalent to The General, listen to their song, *The Story of Benjamin Darling pt. 1*","Bruh\n\n\"Manny don't need no comforting / he don't ask for nobody to bring him up\"","Not new. State Radio has been around a long time. ","MMmmm, Black Cab Motorcade. Rushian. I caught State Radio a couple of times in Iowa City and they put on a kickass show.","[This was always my favorite Dispatch song.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vb9fnX9MzKQ)","Great song! The All Points Bulletin live version with Phil Keggy is wonderful.","*Yes*. So many good jams on that album.

I've never seen this video before though, it's pretty awesome.","That album was decent but that song is by far the best one on there. I'd put it in my top 10 dispatch songs I think, and that's tough to do ","That whole album is my favorite song.","Was fortunate enough to see Chad do a living room set in front of about 25 people a few years ago. He played our wedding song and sang it to my wife. I got laid that night. Was a great experience. ","Does anyone else remember downloading Sublime songs on Napster and getting this song?","One of my favorite songs!","This is considered Indie Folk? ","I wasn't really sure what to call it but I had to put something. I don't think there's always a real need to label music by genres. Just enjoy what I enjoy.","I agree, I just always figured there was a specific name for the OAR, Dispatch, type music. I don't know what I would call it ","They're kind of jam bands, but \"jam band\" covers such a wide variety of music that I don't think it could be called its own genre anyway.","That lightbulb in that firehouse. Been on for over 100 years. I think it has a Webcam. ","This band has been my favorite 10+ years any cd I put in instantly puts me in a great mood. also state radio is amazing Chad is an extreemly talented person.","This was on the soundtrack of a game called 'Payback'. It was a top-down GTA-style game on the old Commodore Amigas.","I will never forget how to play this song. When I moved into my university housing and people noticed me playing guitar this song and \"Hey There Delilah\" where the most requested songs. ","The number of times I've had to play Hey There Delilah, Wonderwall and Good Riddance is way too much haha.","I left Good Riddance in High School. I was in jazz band first period so I'd carry around my guitar all day and I played Good Riddance and Crash Into Me what seems like every day","Usually now if I want to impress a girl while playing guitar I'll play John Mayer because at least he's fun to play to and girls go crazy over his stuff.","I tried impressing my gf by playing some Kaki King songs, she told me to stick with Andy Grammer lol","I don't know who either of those are. Worth checking out?","Andy Grammer is a pop singer that I think is pretty good and my gf is in love with\n\nKaki king is my favorite guitar player out there, check out her album Glow if you want hear some ridiculous acoustic guitar playing. ","It doesn't really sound like she's doing anything too crazy with the guitar. If you want insane acoustic guitar playing check out [Joscho Stephan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_jzSv7G6vQ)","That's pretty awesome. I'll throw one more at you, my favorite guitar player, Michael Kelsey:\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frwsaK14o5U)","I may be a bit biased since this is my favorite band, but go and listen to their stuff. Across their discography, there's something for just about everyone.","I could never get into this band. A lot of my friends loved them, but I never clicked with them. They seemed to be a pop variety of the 90s jam band scene. Which isn't a slight, but it just wasn't my thing. Hadn't thought about them in years.","This fight is not worth fighting.  ","Dispatch was the best live concert I've ever seen ","Man, these are good times. The teacher that ran my highschool's guitar club would keep an acoustic in his room and play this all the time. I used to skip classes and just jam with him. Such a cool song.","I remember listening to this one https://youtu.be/Hm1YkW2Mh2U over and over one summer. I hadn't really paid attention to the lyrics at first, I just knew it made me feel nostalgic and happy. One time singing along, it registered what I was saying. The Flying Horses holds such a special place in my heart and memories, and every time I visited as a kid I wanted to take a ring SO BAD but never had the nerve. Instead, winning the brass ring made me feel like I had my own for just a moment. Love love love this song.","Never heard of these guys, then a few years ago the Palladia channel on cable showed them at the NJ Redbull stadium and could not figure out how a band got THIS BIG and I know nothing about them. \n\nThe General made me a fan for life!  What is left of it anyway.","This album is wonderful","Man... these guys, and most of what they do. Spectacular.","I fucking love Dispatch. Got to see them at Red Rocks, Chad and Brad popped up right in the middle of the crowd and played Bats in the Belfry. Too cool.","Been pretty obsessed with Dispatch and State Radio lately. Fond memories of my mom singing along to this song on road trips","i can listen to any song on, \"gut the van\" the live songs are amazing\n","Steeples on Gut the Van when they start doing the acapella breakdown is the greatest thing ever.","[this was one of my favs](https://youtu.be/UuYd1uyJyqA)","Thought for sure this was going to be something else...","This is such a great song, gives me chills every time I hear \"section 17\"","the story behind it is really sad and it was the first time i learned how horrible west Africa and specifically Zimbabwe was ","Took months for me to learn the lyrics","Really? It is a pretty simple song and half of the words are basically spoken. If English is your second language, I apologize. ","My favorite song ever.","A year or so later the drummer Braddigan did a small show at my college. It was really good. I have the audio somewhere. ","I started listening to them around 2012. I had no idea that the music I've been listening to is 15-20 years old until just now after reading some of the comments in this thread. I guess that just goes to show how great their music is!","The Acoustic brilliance of this song is unreal.﻿","Oh hey! Glad to see these guys getting some love. I discovered then years back and had to hunt down a few their albums. Anybody know if they're still active?","Maaaan. I love this fucking song. A friend of mine who used to share awesome new bands with me (Saosin, Avenged Sevenfold, Chiodos, Copeland, Acceptance, Desaparecidos) sent this song to me one day, and I was fucking blown away.","Hell yes! Love dispatch ","About 14 years ago, a girl I went to high school with told me to listen to \"Two coins\" and now she's my wife of 5 years.  So thanks for that Dispatch.  ","Saw them at the Wetlands in NYC in 2000 play to a few hundred people having never heard them before. This song, and a few others, stuck with me on the drive home. Saw them a bunch in 2000-2001, just an amazing live band.","Just pulled my guitar out for the first time in months and started by playing this song first.  Such a great one.\n","This is one of my all time favorites. Brings back memories of watching a father-son duo jamming out in their garage. ","You can almost create a calendar based on how frequently someone posts this song in this subreddit.","I first heard this from a World of Warcraft PVP video, a rogue with a Thunderfury named Caen from Bloodsworn (before they were Overrated) on Shadow Moon server. \n\nDamn I got to listen and like a few good songs from WoW PVP videos now that I think about it.","This song is so nostalgic for me. My older brother was into Dispatch, and played this all the time. I was obsessed with the guitar intro. ","One of my favorite songs by one of my favorite bands of all time. This one takes me back.","One of my absolute favorites","Any dudes wanna go hack some sack on the quad? I'll be the guy wearing the dmb '96 tour shirt","Thank you for saying that. It is one of my more cherished memories.  ","I've been jammin to this song for like 7 years. My brother blew my mind when he told me state radio was the same guy from dispatch.","I worked for these guys for a summer before they blew up. A buddy and I ran their merch table. We traveled with them to shows at prep schools, colleges, and small clubs from New England down to New York. Spent a lot of time with them in random places. All very good guys. Nice, down to earth, and at the time understood how lucky they were. This was in 99-00, and is a time that was fucking awesome. ","Can confirm every college bro from 2002 - 2007 knew this song.\n","Love this song","you lucky bastard\n\none of the most historic concerts of all time\n","Best concert I've ever seen","That was crazy. That many people crowded in there.  Busy and I drove nonstop from Illinois to see them, alternating sleeping.\n\nWhat's crazier is pricing for booze down there. $11 for a Jagerbomb.","Pete's not the guitarist.  He plays bass on most songs, including this one.","Actually, it's completely dependent on the song. On the recordings, he most likely plays both, or it can be one or the other depending on which member wrote the song. As for live, they all switch around, again depending on who wrote the song. \n\nPete and Chad are pretty equal as far as guitar goes.The only semi-permanent position in this band is Brad on percussion, and you'd be surprised how many songs he's actually the one playing guitar. \n\nAs for the story I was referring to, I can almost guarantee he was talking about Pete because he is a chain smoker. Plus, I don't think either of the other band members smoke. ","oh elias.... elias, elias","All I remember was that it was camp beber in Wisconsin. And I'm from Maryland so I thought there was a chance it was the same camp","Same here. Freshman year of college way back in 2002. Virginia Tech. ","At what camp were you a counsellor, if you don't mind me asking?","YMCA Rotary Camp Presqu'ile near Owen Sound","Ah ok, then you weren't my counsellor","Went to camp in GA/NC. Both songs were played. ","Yep, around this time-period Dispatch, OAR, and DMB were all over at my college. Hip hop was also","lolwut","I really don't know a lot about dispatch, but I went to a prep school graduating in that time frame and remembered dispatch as having been past their prime. Weren't they on reunion tours in the mid-2000s?","\"Final\" show in 2004 at the Hatch She'll in Boston, 3 reunion shows at MSG one weekend in 2007 to raise money to support a charity in Zimbabwe, and then they got back together in 2011 and have had an EP/album since and done a couple tours. A bit of a slower place cause the guys are all still involved in their slower stuff","I got to see them at vibes two years ago and it was magical","Seen them 3 times now. Best one by far has been MSG this past summer. Totally incredible","Was there for that... Amazing show.. Saw them there and at fire fly ","So crazy how it takes bands breaking up to figure out the whole \"one album as a band, then one solo album\" balance","I saw them in New Jersey like 5-6 years ago and they killed it. ","Red Bull Arena? That's another one I was at! First time seeing them, unreal encore especially with the zip line ","That was it!  I was going to say red bull arena, but I wasn't sure if I had the name right. They zip line thing was amazing!","They did a show in 2009 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. as well. All-acoustic set at a time when they had been \"broken up\" since Zimbabwe (and before). That was the only time I saw them, but it was an incredible experience. We had about 30 people outside for a jam beforehand, and they came out and signed autographs and jammed with us for a while. One of the coolest things I've been a part of.","They have been doing gigs and tours intermittently for the last decade or so. ","Same for me. Freshman year 2002. ","Recent college grad here..... Please describe this era of college bro. Sounds strange and interesting. ","Imagine the bro you know and now imagine him listening to this song.\n\n\nHonestly though, I was pretty happy when my childhood friends that went the bro route started listening to good music in college.","It's just, I think if the bros I know played this track the keystone light cans in their hands would spontaneously rupture and their Vineyard vine hats would fly off. ","haha. We still drank keystone light, but just played this and crazy game of poker. \n\n\n","Not so sure though. The general was written before 2003.\n\nEDIT:\n\nnevermind...chose to look up the song:\n\nIn The Best of Dispatch, a book containing guitar and voice transcriptions of selected Dispatch songs, Chad Urmston describes \"The General\":\n\n“\tThis was our anti-war song. Although it was primarily based on the Civil War, the message was not confined to that particular conflict. The song tells about General Robert E. Lee telling his Confederate army to basically go home and stop fighting. We were too young to be directly involved in the Gulf War; nevertheless, the sense of a troubled history rings loud in the heads of young men who grow up listening to grandfathers or fathers recount war stories. The crowd response to this song always blew us away. Some said it had a \"Castles Made of Sand\" feel - any reference to Hendrix we took gladly.\nWe recorded the song up in the northeast kingdom on borrowed instruments. Our hazy-eyed hairball engineer swayed like a derelict wrecking ball over the console like a played-out carnie with nothing to show for a lifetime of swindling. His down-to-the-filter cigarette wandered listlessly with a skeletal droop of ash as he leaned on his crippled office chair teasing gravity. He ended up giving in to his heavy eyes and passing out on the couch with his feet up, still holding the cigarette as Brad and I took turns pressing the \"record\" and \"locate\" buttons.[3]","Dripping in goat juice","See, I always found them to be quite awesome.  Good entertainers, songs that very much tell stories. And their songs are such a variety of sounds that listening to an album doesn't get old sounding by the last song.","steeples is amazing, their live versions are some much better than their studio songs","Awesome Song to play on guitar, such great energy","The lead singer, Braddigan, came to the navy base I lived on in Japan for a small free show about a decade ago now. My friends and I somehow were able to play a few songs to open for him, and daaaaamn, we were so bad haha. Always brings back good memories whenever I hear Dispatch though.","Brad is drummer, but does some vocals as well. He is a awesome guy though.","fuck this shit song","I would definitely consider this ska not indie folk rock. I like it all the same.","Take a shower/shine your shoes/you've got no time to lose. ~ Seriously, who still shines their shoes? Because of this song I do. ","Military. They shine their shoes that are part of their uniform all the time. ","The lyrics drive me crazy\n\n\"But not a man moved. Their eyes gazed straight ahead, till one-by-one they stepped back and not a word was said.\"\n\nSo a man moved! Immediately after you say not a man moved every single man left wtf man get it together\n\nEdit: People cannot handle a minor critique to a song they like","The word \"till\" makes it acceptable","They were given a pass. The General, in his dream, saw the other soldiers and saw that they had mothers; they were no different than his men. \"This fight is not worth fighting.\" The General knew that both sides would take great loss, and for what? Land? Money? Whatever it was, it wasn't worth dying for. So he took the heat, and will pay the ultimate price so that these young men could live another day and hopefully fight a fight worth fighting one day.","From my home town!","Not enough people know about this band - my favourite ever!","Classic","Fucking hate this song.","http://i.imgur.com/AB7XhUe.jpg","Cool, thanks for letting us know","I never thought I'd have to hear this fucking awful song ever again, yet here we are.

Back in spring 2012 these guys were filming a music video for \"Not Messin'\" in Rhode Island, where I was living at the time. They needed ~200 fans to help them filled it and I thought \"why the hell not?\" and went. It was a fairly long day and by the end there were only 100 of us left and they played a few of their hits to thank us.

Maybe not for that alone but you have the shipping as stated and if you ship, don't remember exactly, around 20 items then it's payed for in total. As well, you have the spotify type service that works well and has a decent selection. Then you also have the photo backup. Personally, I would get rid of Netflix and Spotify before Prime.

But strictly stupid things are stupid.","In some cases, you probably do need to get into an accident before realizing that you shouldn't speed.  Sure, people know that speeding could cause an accident.  However, there is a massive difference between \"some people get in accidents when they speed\" and \"if I speed, there's a good chance that I will get in an accident\".  It's easy to rationalize things away with \"others could, but I'm better/smarter/faster/etc so it won't happen to me\".\n\nAlso, you have to ask the right question before you can find the obvious answer.  Say there's a pot of boiling water on the stove.  Someone goes to pick it up without pot holders and burns themself.  Is that a stupid mistake?  Yes.  Of course the pot is hot, its been on the stove for the last 20 minutes.  And of course hot things can burn you.  Is that a mistake that a smart person shouldn't have made?  Eh.\n\nIn day to day life (assuming you don't spend much time in the kitchen), you can generally pick up just about everything without worrying about heat.  In that case, you probably assume that temperature isn't an issue without every consciously thinking about it.  Now, you are dealing with a new experience (cooking on a stove), and that assumption is no longer valid.  However, the whole point of an assumption is that you aren't consciously thinking about it.  Therefore, you continue to assume subconsciously that heat isn't an issue and you burn yourself on a hot stove.  It is extraordinarily stupid, but it is a perfectly understandable mistake to make (once, at least).","&gt; Do you really need to drive over the speed limit, get into an accident, possibly get injuries, to know that speeding can cause accidents?\n\nyeah... even though I agree with you, I just read that you don't own a car so... maybe you should choose another example until then...

Still saying it's a bad bad idea, but my point is it's not an idea, there is no decision process involved here...

Even a driver, who HASN'T been in a speeding accident, knows that he is mistaking a mistake by speeding. \n\nIn conclusion, some lessons don't require mistakes to be made to be learned.

Something like \"buying another microtransaction is like driving over the limit by a couple mph, it seems harmless and the more you do it the more it seems like you can get away with it, until you fuck up big time\"  \n","Are you really trying to argue that going 1 mile an hour over the speed limit is always a mistake?  Going too fast is clearly a mistake.  \"Too fast\" doesn't necessarily have a close connection to the speed limit.  There are a lot of places where the speed limit is X and I know damn well that it is completely safe (in good conditions, at least) to do X+Y.  If it is raining/snowing/dark/whatever, sure, I will slow down (possibly to below the speed limit, depending on the conditions).  That doesn't mean that going over the speed limit is always unsafe.\n\nFor that matter, there are also a lot of situations where going 10 over the speed limit is safer than going 5 under the speed limit -- if everyone around you is going at a given speed, matching them will be safer than praying that the guy behind you notices you and doesn't rear end you.\n\nI guess this might be culture dependent to an extent.  In the US (or at least the mid atlantic/northeast), people tend to assume that the enforced speed limit is actually 10mph higher than the listed limit, and I think that listed limits are often lowered to counteract that.  Is that a pretty stupid system?  Yes.  Fixing it is somewhat harder, though.","Difference being I had the foresight to never HAVE to learn from my mistakes. \"oops lol sorry bro guess you're out 600 dollars\" isn't justified because you \"learn you lesson\" afterwards.","What's it like to be born with perfect foresight?

I don't have any difficulty at all imagining a 14 year old falling into that kind of trap.","I'm not a parent, but I would probably have a talk with my 14 year old kid and let them know that there isn't going to be punishment.  Kids are allowed to make mistakes.\n\nThen, for the next month or two, the family as a whole pays off the debt.  Allowances, if there are any, are reduced.  family meals are cheapened, lots of rice/beans/etc.  Things like soda/juice not purchased and replaced with water.  Instead of taking 2 cars to get around, one car is garaged and the family carpools in the morning to get to work/school, and car pools to get home.  The whole goal behind this is not to show that if you get caught you get punished, but regardless of what happened or who is to blame, the family unit has to deal with the consequences.","14 year olds do not have a lot of empathy yet.  All you will be doing is making the entire family (including yourself) miserable and the 14 year old *will not care*.","You're right. Remove one of their fingers. Use your teeth and look them in the eye as you do it.","There needs to be punishment. The 14 year old did something wrong  (spent money not his) and should have to pay it back. Besides that, he lied about spending the money, which is possibly a bigger transgression.","And to show just how much that kind of money is. ","&gt;It is very likely that someone was a victim or phishing, rather than deliberately or accidentally spending money.\n\nIn which case, you're screwed, because Sony doesn't give a fuck. They won't reimburse your account even if it's hacked, which happened to thousands of users a year or two ago.","Can only speak for myself, but my PSN was hacked a few years ago and I had my credit card charged for £60 for some kind of trading card stuff for a FIFA game, which I didn't even own. Contacted Sony as soon as I noticed (within a few days) and they asked for the console's ID.\n\nTook about a month or two more, but I got all the money back as a full refund. The only problem with such issues is that if you contact the bank about it and they perform a chargeback, some companies will ban your whole damn account, which sucks.","Fair point, but they pretty much stonewalled everyone who had their account compromised last year. A lot of people did ultimately issue chargebacks and were banned, so they just told Sony to fuck themselves and left the Playstation community altogether. ","Why would somebody breach an account's security and then give away the breach by purchasing 600$ worth of content using that account and download them on someone else's machine??\n\nFurther why would they fake the IP so that Sony saw the purchases coming from their home?","Can you quantify \"very real chance\" after the OP says that was already discussed with Sony?","No you take away their hours.","\"I can't believe you think I'm that kind of person\" is the kind of line someone uses when they're used to getting out of trouble by crying and acting hurt.  It's almost always an adulterer's first defense as well.","No doubt it's sometimes used to obfuscate by liars but there is nothing like the pain caused by people you love, respect and trust accusing you of something you did *not* do. I've used those words with absolute honesty in the past.","its not only a learning experience for the 14 yo but the brother as well. secure your accounts especially if they have banking info attached","Reading posts like this one is like having someone sit down and spell out specifically how my parents fucked up and could have not fucked up.","This would be a great recommendation for a 8-10 year old.  A 14-year old?  Your ass is gonna mow lawns until you can pay back that $600.","Which is covered in the \"here's how I will make it up to you\" portion of the apology.","Which is seriously dwarfed by the paragraphs explaining how a 14-year old doesn't know right from wrong or how money works.  Shit, a 14-year old probably has a better grasp of how the PlayStation and credit cards work than the parent does.","Have you played those games? They make millions off those IAPs. They're deliberately designed to be as easy to buy as possible. I have no trouble believing a 14 year old could buy one without really knowing what they were doing. $600 worth? Less so. But the point still stands. ","14 year olds aren't stupid.  They just think they'll get away with stuff because they don't have experience dealing with problems yet.  He knows what he was doing, and was unaware he was going to face consequences.","This is simply ignorant. You cant generalize all 14 year olds. I certainly did not have a good grasp on either when i was at this age.","Seriously what disturbs me is how the comment linked to here doesn't treat \"paying back the money\" or \"making sure the 17YO gets his money back\" as priority number one \n\n\n*His brother needs to give your son a way to make amends, and your job is to make sure it's fair. Ideally, it should be something constructive (like a repayment plan or some other, less direct restitution)*\n\n\nRepaying the money is not optional, or \"one of the options\", it's critical, the 14YO stole from the 17YO, if the 14YO is not able to be responsible for this the parents need to step in and make up the difference. I'd damn well expect the parents to empty the 14YOs bank account and sell all his posessions to make up that $600. Even if the parents pay for some of it they need to make sure the 14YO is the one who suffers, \"no sorry we can't pay for your guitar lessons because we gave you the money your brother stole\" is just as bad as leaving the 17Yo without the money.\n\n\nAnyone who thinks this family unit is going to function if the money is not paid back is divorced from reality, if the younger brother is allowed to get away with this without paying back the money then the family is done for. What does it teach the 17YO? Crimes have o punishment? THat he cannot trust anyone or rely on rules and property rights to prevail? It wouldn't suprise me if he starts padlocking his bedroom. This money was hard earned, he did hard dirty work for. If I was that 17YO everytime I saw them spend money on somemthing like ice cream for the family I'd be seeing that as my money, apparently there's money to spend on my little brother who stole $600 from me but not money to give me back some of that $600.","Given the information the OP provided, it seems that the 14 year old used the brother's card for his video games. We can discuss intent all we want, but in the end, the younger brother (possibly by accident) ended up costing his brother $600. \n\nPersonally, I think this is a great time to teach the 14 year old and the 17 year old a few lessons. In the real world if you cause someone harm, even without any mal intent, you still need to pay. Just today I saw someone unloading their van, and they hit the car next to them, causing a slight dent. The person who did the damage did not do so intentionally, and wasn't even particularly reckless, he just made a bad move and now needs to pay. Similarly, I will assume the 14 year old was not being malicious, or even understood the impact of his actions, but guess what, he caused harm and should pay up. He is old enough to get a part time job (a few hours each weekend) doing dishes, working for McDonalds, bussing tables, etc. to pay off the debt.\n\nAs for trust, the father needs to present the evidence and ask the 14 year old one more time if he did it. If he refuses to admit fault, he loses privileges to use the PS4. If not he has full right to use it, but under a separate account. The PS4 is a privilege, and if the 14 year old cannot even admit to his wrong doing, he loses the privilege. Being an adult is owning up to your wrong doings.\n\nAs for the 17 year old, you need to teach him the ability to accept apologies, and forgive wrong doings if the 14 year old works to pay him back. It also is a good time to teach him to review his account information to ensure false charges do not go through.","u/This_Vicious_Cabaret gives the kind of weak parenting advice that makes for the kids that steal your car stereos. 14 year olds already had a chance to learn about honesty. My kids will be learning about punishment if they steal at 14, like they should.","Oh yeah. He knows he was wrong. It is why he is lying. ","Except most of what he wrote is dead wrong. Coddling a teenager who's straight up lying is not smart. He 1,000% knows he was spending real money, and it was 1,000% on micro transactions. ","[removed]","What are you talking about with your first point? I've had a bank account and a debit card since I was 15 when I started working part time. Similar with my sister and all my friends. A 17 year old is basically an adult, they need to be able to manage those type of things.","17 - you don't need a debit card\n\n18 - vote for government office and begin military duty","[removed]","Immediate counterpoint, I've had a debit card since 12 (nationwide FlexOne) that my pocket money got put into and that taught me SO much about managing money. This scenario probably wouldn't have happened if they were in charge of their own money and understood the concepts better.","I'm not saying they shouldn't have a bank account or money of their own. I'm saying that they need to be taught to manage it better. First of all tying a debit card to an online game platform is just a terrible idea because it's virtually impossible to dispute charges. Second it's clear they aren't managing it well because it took 2 months to notice $20 transactions every other day.\n\nThose two facts alone make it clear that they need help managing their account.","At 16 I got a job, and a debit card that I could use as I pleased. 17 is not too young for a debit card, if the person is working, they earned that money.","Ima just wade into the sea of your downvotes and tell you that I agree with you.\n\nI got my first  job at 17, and my first checking account to match. I used a debit card, mostly responsibly, but there were definitely a few times when I ran out of money and nearly overdrew. It didn't feel like spending money, it felt like swiping plastic. Then within a few years my card was used illegally (not by me) and about $1k was gone. There was literally NO recourse; my hard-earned money was just gone.\n\nI wish my stupid seventeen-year-old self was cognizant of the dangers of a debit card. I would have stuck strictly with cash had I known.\n\nAlso, keeping a close eye on your finances is a necessity, because, as you say, in the real world, mom and dad can't just make a thief pay you back.","1) You're paranoid - 12 year olds can and, in my opinion, should get debit cards. Fucking up when you're 13 and losing £30 is better than fucking up when you're 20 and losing £3000\n\n2) How do you even check your account *weekly*. I get statements in quarterly (I assume that OP did too - hence the 2 month gap) and check online when I need to make a payment for rent or bills. Why would someone do so more than weekly? Just to check? Monday: No fraud. Wednesday: Nope. Friday: Still nothing...\n\n3) The bank won't care, but small claims court will (if they're both adults). You can't just steal $600 from someone in the real world, even if you're their brother. They need to be taught that this is seriously not OK and that the actions would have serious, serious consequences in the future.","&gt; 12 year olds can and, in my opinion, should get debit cards. Fucking up when you're 13 and losing £30 is better than fucking up when you're 20 and losing £3000\n\nAnd this kid was 17, lost much more than \"£30\", and daddy is having to sort out the mess for him. No where do I see where this means that this kid can manage a debit card appropriately. Some kids can, yes, but clearly this one can't.\n\n&gt;How do you even check your account weekly\n\nMy budgeting app automatically pulls in my bank account transactions as soon as they clear (typically about 3 days). Before then I just didn't check it that often (maybe once a month?) because I just never used a debit card. For my credit card, I'd just look through my statement quickly about once a week and see if there was anything that I didn't pay for and dispute it if needed. I've had to do this maybe 3x in my adult life. The disputes are usually resolved within the month and I don't have to pay for it. It took ~5 minutes a week. With my current budgeting app, it's automatic and I don't really have to do anything.\n\n&gt;The bank won't care, but small claims court will (if they're both adults).\n\nGood luck with that when (as has happened to one friend of mine) your debit card is skimmed from a machine and you are out over $1k and you don't even know who did it. And even if you knew the person, do you really think it's easy to just go to court to get it back? It's a serious cost in time and some money. Why not avoid it in the first place?\n\nSeriously, if you are using debit cards for everyday transactions, you are putting yourself at completely  unnecessary risk. [I'm far from the only person who thinks this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbarro/2012/04/03/why-you-should-never-use-debit-cards/#2858e3b5eb6b). [More good reason not to use a debit card](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/01/14/why-you-should-never-use-your-debit-card.aspx)","The issue with this is that a 17 year old is much better off with a debit card than a credit card, they can only spend money they have. You are saying its this kid's fault his brother is a shit head, and it's not. I had my purse stolen and they used my debit card to buy some things, I called the bank and the money was back within days.","&gt;You are saying its this kid's fault his brother is a shit head\n\nWhere did I say this? I specifically said it wasn't (and his brother definitely should be punished in some way). I'm saying that his financial management skills are shit and that clearly needs guidance because he didn't notice for *2 months* and he's using a debit card for everyday expenses. He has zero recourse to ever get his money back because of both those things. In the real world that could have easily been his entire checking account and now he can't pay rent and he gets evicted.\n\nHere, let me put it this way: Imagine if I leave $600 in an envelope on my front porch and don't check on it for months on end and it ends up missing. Yeah, it's not my fault that it's stolen, but I also shouldn't have been as careless with it.\n\nIf this were with a credit card, that would be one thing. You have much better legal protections with those. There's a reason why most financial advisers tell you never to use debit.","Just to offer a different perspective, I check my credit card and bank balances online (on mobile) every few days. I keep a budget, as well as a ledger of everything I spend, so I keep close track on my spending, keep receipts, watch balances, etc etc.\n\nSo it's definitely possible to be vigilant about your finances. And its well worth it, in my opinion.","My bank's app sends me notifications every day about how much is in my account and will send me an alert if my savings dip below a certain point.

I drive a car from the 90s, and am rather frugal about my spending. (Simply because after bills and expenses, I am broke)\n\nYes I had a decent upbringing, yes I generally had everything I could need, and a good bit of what I want.

","I'm American and where I am we say both. Given my experience, not very many people know there are other queens. There is the Queen of England and that is it. It wasn't until my last year of high school some of us learned that Spain had royalty too. So when people say \"He/she went to go visit the Queen\" or \"The Queen is coming\" they either mean Beyonce or the Queen of England.","Alternatively if they say \"Queen is coming\" then Freddie Mercury is apparently back from the dead.","FYI she's not the Queen of England; that's not been a title since 1707.\n\n&gt;[Anne became Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland on 8 March 1702. On 1 May 1707, under the Acts of Union, two of her realms, the kingdoms of England and Scotland, united as a single sovereign state known as Great Britain. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain)","Here's a question for you then. Is she  still the Queen of England, in the same way that Canada happens to have the same Queen as we do? Is it legitimate to call her the Queen of, say, London, or Berkshire, or wherever? Because it seems to me that 'Queen Of England' is a subset of 'Queen of Great Britain' \n\nGenuinely asking here, if you happen to know. ","No, because the Acts of Union 1706/7 dissolved the kingdoms of Scotland and England and replaced it with a single Kingdom of Great Britain. Canada is a separate kingdom. The current kingdom is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Queen of England is always wrong, because there is no kingdom to be queen of.\n\nEqually, Queen of Great Britain has been wrong since 1801.","So there is no such thing as Scotland or England? ","Yes, but they're not kingdoms. Have you never played CK2?","So there is an England, and it is part of Great Britain? Wouldn't the Queen of the kingdom be the reigning monarch of all descending territories in that kingdom? ","I think that they are trying to say that while yes she is queen over the territory of England, amongst other places, \"Queen of England\" is not her correct title. It would be like calling Obama \"President of Texas\". Correct from a certain point of view, but not the done thing.\n\nMind you, if you want to be properly correct you have to say \"Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\".","It's like saying Obama is the President of New York. New York is not a country to be president of, it's a state. Yes the USA includes New York but that's not the same thing.","I'm American and I very rarely here \"the Queen of England.\" Most of the time it's just \"Queen Elizabeth\" or \"the Queen\" if the topic is already established. As for the rest of the royal family, I've noticed a divide in males and females. I feel like most men just say \"William\" or \"Kate\" whereas the girls I know always say \"Prince William.\"","Queen of England isn't even an existing title so they must clearly be referring to some long dead monarch of at least 300 and potentially 400 years ago so it's good that they don't say that","Right, but very few Americans know that. To them (us), she is \"the Queen of England.\" I don't know why that mistake is the default here. And agreeing with many others: I think it's fair to say that for most Americans, if you say \"the Queen,\" they automatically think of Elizabeth. \n\nEdit: bad grammar","\"Prince Charles\" is pretty ubiquitous, though. ","We even gave him his own comic here with his twin brother Gallant! ","We (Americans) will often call the Queen \"the Queen\". See? I just did it. Yes, we also might say \"the Queen of England\". The distinction between Britain and England seems to be lost on a lot of people here.\n  \nI'm in Massachusetts, for the record. ","American in Oklahoma here.\n\nI don't know anyone who specifies \"of England.\" Everyone just calls her \"The Queen.\"","To be fair, there's no Queen of the Commonwealth.

It just says the passport belongs to her government. It doesn't say I have to accept her as my rightful superior. True, she's got more money, power, corgis and influence than me. But you can't judge a fish by how well it climbs trees. I passed my 11+ and had a Top Tip published in Viz, so I'm superior to her in some respects. If I had my say, I'd vote for one of The Nolans as queen. Or Cerys Matthews.","Well, if you hold a British passport, you'll find the Royal Coat of Arms on the front cover and the motto \"Dieu et mon driot\" (God and my right), which is the motto of the British monarch. It should also state inside that you travel in the name of Her Majesty. \n\nWell, if the passport belongs to Government, and the Government is made up of Ministers of the Crown, surely if you concede that the Government is your \"superior\" (your word), and that she is the superior of the Government, she is, by extension, your superior. \n\nAnyway, that's besides the point.

","I think i'm in love!","&lt;3","For those who don't get it https://youtu.be/dOOTKA0aGI0?t=2m","That's why having a non-elected head of state is a good thing. She represents everyone and is not politically divisive. Cameron cannot represent the state as he is a political figure. People can say \"well I didn't vote for him\". The Queen represents the whole nation precisely because she is not elected.","I've never seen a president who was as good a head of state as the Queen. They're either megalomaniacs or insipid committee types. Heads of state are for diplomacy. Leave the governing to the government.","There's an expression,  but I can't remember it.

For Republicans, if any candidate ( Trump this time is more likely) gets 1237 delegates in the primaries, it will be extremely difficult and 'unseemly' ( though not technically impossible, as far as I know) to deny him the nomination.","On the Republican side though, you have a huge disconnect between the Republican party leaders and the voters of said party. Trump is overwhelming popular with Republicans yet the party leaders hate him because he would be such an unknown. They aren't a fan of Ted Cruz either because he is massively anti-Establishment. \n\nThey are now doing everything they can to stop Trump reaching 1237 delegates so that he doesn't win the first round of voting at the convention, hence co tested convention, free vote for all delegates and they can pick someone else. Rumours are, since Cruz and Trump are unpopular in the party, they will pick Kaisch or the party will enter an extra candidate purely at the convention. \n\nSo basically, Trump and Cruz, jointly with overwhelming majority of the votes now it's a three horse race could both NOT be the nomination in favour of someone who dropped out months ago like Jeb Bush or Kaisch who has barely any votes in comparison. And the Republican Party desperately wants it. May be within the rules of the convention, but that is MASSIVE voter disenfranchisement ","Yes ,  I agree. But as much as I hate the RNC Establishment ( I am a Rand Paul supporter ), it is not really a case of voter disenfranchisement, is it?  It is often said that RNC and DNC are private bodies, and the public will definitely be able to vote in the general elections.","But if a huge majority of Republican voters say effectively say \"We want Trump\" and \"We want Cruz\", then the party says back \" We heard you, but here, vote for Jeb Bush, even though you didn't vote for him earlier and he dropped out as a result\". That's the definition of voter disenfranchisement  ","See, I agree with you in spirit. What I'm trying to say is, if the people can convince Trump/Cruz to run 3rd party ( if they are 'seized' of the nomination), then the people can vote for Trump/Cruz. Else vote for RNC/DNC/Libertarian/GreenParty/Write-in-someone. I agree that the contested convention will seem evil, maybe it is indeed evil (heck, I hate it) , but it is legal and unfortunately, right ( from the perspective of RNC's rights).","America and third parties doesnt really work because of the way the media, election system and funding works. Ok, this would be slightly different as they have had a lot of publicity during the primaries but still, it would be unlikely.\n\nAnyway, the issue is voter disenfranchisement. It's impossible to argue that effectively overruling the voters in NOT disenfranchisement as it is the definition of it. Legality of what they are doing is besides the issue. Its a moral issue, not a legal one\n","oh, BINGO!, my family think I'm a tin-hatter for muttering about Governments being mere mouthpieces for Big Money, but I know it's true.

Despite sending tens of thousands of soldiers over the past decade or so in support of their stupid wars.

A country that not only takes billions in aid from the US but also hasn't actually done anything close to what Europe has done for the US in its entire existence. All major politicians and all major demographics in the US speak consistent on this issue with the exception of a very small minority so it's not just Trump.\n\nWhen the US tells us to fuck off, when they say Britain or Europe is weak and contributes nothing. Remember everything that was done over this entire WoT and the Cold War.\n\nIf they want Israel to be their only ally, let them fucking have it I say.

They'll triumphantly announce how weak they think Europe is and how Europe is constantly stabbing America in the back whilst soldiers are dying on the battlefields and billions are being spent ....right as they speak on their podiums, then they lap up Israel whilst Israel takes billions from them and contributes nothing.","&gt; A country that not only takes billions in aid from the US\n\nUS spends $3b a year defending Israel. US spends $200b a year defending Europe.\n\n&gt;but also hasn't actually done anything close to what Europe has done for the US in its entire existence.\n\nThat's not exactly an insult, most Americans believe Europe is the peak of human civilization after the US.\n\n&gt;If they want Israel to be their only ally, let them fucking have it I say.\n\nThe US is allied with almost everyone. Other than Syria, Lebanon &amp; Iran they're allied with all of the countries of the middle east and north Africa. Israel is the country America most criticises.

It's strange that the small amount of aid to Israel receives such disproportionate attention, would it be better for the US to let the only liberal country in the middle east get invaded and destroyed?","Like I said, the mentality in the US is that Europe does nothing for them. Despite spending billions on wars and (I know nobody cares but) actual lives lost too. Yet the American media, government and populace constantly likes to pretend that Europe never does anything for America and that Israel is the only true great ally. \n\nSo how many more dead soldiers and stupid wars and terror attacks does a country even need if it's still just going to be considered a worthless ally. The US offers nothing. Europe doesn't need to pretend to hate Russia so it has to pretend to need 200bn of US military aid so that the US can pretend to say Europe does nothing. \n\nAll whilst Americans talk about how worthless the world is despite the fact that so many non-Americans die fighting stupid American wars but the only country that doesn't do that, is the country that is considered the best ally.","I don't know where you're getting that the average American thinks of Israel as this great ally. To be perfectly honest he average American probably doesn't think of Israel much at all. As the other commenter said, most Americans would consider Europe to be Americas greatest allies, especially because huge portions of America have ancestry all over Europe. ","Realistically,  Americans per se don't care about Israel nearly as much as you'd think from watching the media here.  Politicians give it way more time than it deserves soley because every politician that spends money on Israel gets a chunk of it back in political donations.  To vote against anything Israel is to vote against yourself at the next election so most politicians are afraid to do it.\n\nJust one more way how unlimited campaign funds causes democratic elections to break down.","Maybe if we didn't have to keep breaking up Europe's little \"world\" wars we would respect them more.

I mean there are only two power presidents in the world, Putin and Obama.
