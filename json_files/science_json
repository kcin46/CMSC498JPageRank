One of the key features of the adaptive immune system is the ability to distinguish 'self' from 'foreign'. This property is key to fighting off pathogenic invaders. And in Type I diabetes, the idea is that the adaptive immune system is \"confused\" and \"thinks\" that certain proteins/carbohydrates expressed by cells in the pancreas are from foreign pathogens. So it destroys them.\n\nThe major advance of this paper is that it finds another commonly \"confusing\" protein that often triggers the adaptive immune system to attack the pancreatic cells. This will by no means be the last such molecule identified by researchers. And it by no means provides a complete picture of the areas the immune system attacks in Type I diabetes.\n\nThe whole \"five major auto-antigen\" narrative in the article is also a bit laughable. I can think of plenty of auto-antigens not named by the authors, such as: heat shock protein, islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein, PDX1, chromogranin A and more.\n\nCool research. Has potential therapeutic implications. Terrible title.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people lamenting how breakthrough research never lives up to the hype. I look at it like this: If Reddit was around in the 1920's there would have been a post, *Canadian researcher isolate small peptide from pancreas of dogs; use it to cure diabetes*.\n\nSince that was the foundation of insulin therapy, I say keep swinging for the fences. The nice thing about breakthroughs is that it just takes one good one to really shake everything up.","As someone with an incurrable illness, SirT6's edit has it right. It might not seem exciting to you, but people like me are just excited that any research is being done. There's research right now trying to link Crohn's to MAP bacteria, and while one outcome of that study could lead to new treatments it's really just more exciting that anyone is working on the problem at all.","Same boat.  Diagnosed Ulcerative Colitis last June.  On my third gastro now who isn't convinced it's not really Crohn's.  Just how little does the scientific community know about auto-immune diseases?  Genetic keeps coming up which at least gives me some peace of mind that I couldn't have caused it myself but I don't hear/read enough to really believe that.  I've eaten like shit for years and grew up before transfats and the like were fully known and sometimes wonder if our western diet isn't at least partially to blame for this not so rare but permanent disease.","My immune system decided to eat my left optic nerve last year. \n\nFour neurologists in, having received wildly differing prognoses and diagnoses, I've come to two conclusions; we know very little about the brain much less the immune system and neurologists use migraines in the same way many doctors blame viruses for inexplicable symptoms.\n\nDiet wise, I agree (I'm also Diabetic). Hardest thing about being diabetic is wondering if you did this to yourself somehow.","Curious about the details. I was diagnosed with mild Graves' disease a few years ago, but it's been in remission for a couple of years. \n\nI get migraines that often feel like somebody's kicking the back of my eyeball (usually one side at a time), and often wonder if my immune system is up to no good. Severe Graves' can cause eye problems, and it is an immune system problem.","T1D here with similar migraines, would love this answered as well.","In my case it's hopefully(!) acute disseminated encephalomyelitis which caused or occurred in tandem with optic neuritis; if not then I probably have multiple sclerosis. The only reason the diagnoses is important is the percentage chance of it being MS and the potential for beta interferon therapy. I have no idea what to do.\n\nMy picture of migraines stems from my mother's hormonal migraines. Each time she mensurated she would spend three days in bed in agony and vomiting. Apparently migraines can be much more than that - I have a mixed bag of symptoms that run from seeing things that aren't there and hearing loss to speech disturbance and episodes of exhaustion all of which can go on for weeks.

This isn't true of course.\n\nYou invest a lot of time in having tests and seeing consultants of one kind or another, which is more draining than I think medics imagine, and at the end of it you wonder what the value of it all has been. ","Systemic fungal infection seems a plausibly common complication with diabetes.\n\nFungal cells penetrate mechanisms that regulate sugar metabolism, perhaps to increase their own livelihood (fungi eat sugars). The body then attacks those mechanisms that it now believes are foreign due to the fungal proteins they contain.\n\nAnd presto, autoimmune disease.\n\n&gt;In the present study, we show that corpora amylacea from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) contain fungal proteins as detected by immunohistochemistry analyses. ... Additionally, CNS samples from patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) also contained CA that were immunoreactive with a range of antifungal antibodies. However, CA were less abundant in ALS or PD patients as compared to CNS samples from AD. By contrast, CA from brain tissue of control subjects were almost devoid of fungal immunoreactivity.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27013948\n\n&gt;The possibility that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has a microbial aetiology has been proposed by several researchers. Here, we provide evidence that tissue from the central nervous system (CNS) of AD patients contain fungal cells and hyphae. Fungal material can be detected both intra- and extracellularly using specific antibodies against several fungi. Different brain regions including external frontal cortex, cerebellar hemisphere, entorhinal cortex/hippocampus and choroid plexus contain fungal material, which is absent in brain tissue from control individuals. Analysis of brain sections from ten additional AD patients reveals that all are infected with fungi. Fungal infection is also observed in blood vessels, which may explain the vascular pathology frequently detected in AD patients. Sequencing of fungal DNA extracted from frozen CNS samples identifies several fungal species.\n\nDifferent Brain Regions are Infected with Fungi in Alzheimer’s Disease  \nhttp://www.nature.com/articles/srep15015","My left eye optic nerve got a bit of a chew itself some years ago and has a stable blind spot in the center ever since.

Autoimmune is a huge issue in my life, and I feel like if someone could just find one little thing (whatever that might be), all of my conditions would improve.

Mesenchymal stem cells are being used in [a lot of clinical trials for autoimmune diseases](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=mesenchymal+stem+cells&amp;Search=Search), and research is always ongoing. To be honest though the inclusion criteria of trials usually excludes multiple overlapping conditions so I'm not sure you would be eligible for trials, but if you keep up to date with news, some treatment options may be on the horizon. I don't want to give false hope so you must be aware of the context, many trials are early and any therapy is likely &gt;5 years off. But it's exciting nonetheless.","That is amazing! Thanks for sharing. It is nice to know that things are going on behind the scenes. I'm complicated, and would be thrilled if they figured any of my ailments out. ","There are different theories, but one thing is certain. It isn't your fault. If new research links MAP bacteria then it could be a result of drinking milk that has MAP bacteria in it, but even then that probably just means you have some genetic weakness to MAP bacteria. \n\nYou suffer enough without wondering if it's your fault.

Most research is halted on anything that isnt seen as immediately profitable, which generally involves rare diseases that dont affect many.","If it gives you any hope, the orphan drug act has been allowing lots more research to go into these diseases. Its not like no research is being done, its just that it took a while for laws to be made that gave companies financial incentives to research these rarer diseases. This is from the FDA's website, \n\n\"The ODA created financial incentives for drug and biologics manufacturers, including tax credits for costs of clinical research, government grant funding, assistance for clinical research, and a seven-year period of exclusive marketing given to the first sponsor of an orphan-designated product who obtains market approval from the Food and Drug Administration for the same indication. At the same time, federal programs at the FDA and the NIH began encouraging product development, as well as clinical research for products targeting rare diseases.\"\n\n[FDA ODA](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm143563.htm)\n\nReally the ODA is a huge reason for a lot of biologics (large protein molecules and such) that have been made recently.

My son was diagnosed with type 1 last month, and I assumed he would be using syringes like you mentioned. The whole \"pen\" thing was very surprising","There are still people who uses the syringe, I think it might be cheaper, or some people are convinced they are more exact (they are not). I think I have used a 'pen' for at least 20 years. They also come refillable if you are dead set on using ampules, but i strongly suggest you go with the one-time-pens. (you use them until they are done with, lasts me about a week per pen). \n\nLook, if i have one shot at giving some advice. Diabetes is scary at first, but you soon get used to it. This comes at a cost. In the first decade it's easy enough to have, as you feel absolute nothing from what happens after 20 years. His life is not over, but he will feel invincible \"this is not so bad\" at first. If I could go back and slap the younger me over the head with how I should have taken better care of myself, I would.\n\nIt's the long term, slow things that get you, and you won't know that until it's late to fix them. If you can find some people who have had it for a long time, those are the ones that can give the best advice. Showing pictures of amputated legs is not going to help, but knowing that your will get ED eventually might. Good luck, it's not as bad as it might seem at first, but it's the long term stuff that matters, so set good eating habits and behavior as soon as you can.","Pens aren't just more expensive they're horribly more expensive for the amount of insulin you get per cent compared to how much insulin you get per cent out of a vial.  \n  \nI've used syringes my entire life (over two decades with the disease now) and maintain a 6.1 a1c so let's not just blatantly throw out that pens are better. What's better for a diabetic is what works for them and what let's them maintain homeostasis with their disease. ","what works for me is what my insurance pays for.","True but most diabetics don't have a price difference for insulin as it's covered by national or private health insurance. When I lived in Australia it was the same price regardless of type, and in the UK it's all free.","Yeah the experience of type 1 diabetics is a lot different in the states where a monthly bill for your meds and supplies can often be $400 or more. It disproportionately affects the middle class here specifically because Medicaid covers all expenses for low income individuals but once you're disqualified from that the cost of insurance which does give you comprehensive coverage is often times several hundred as well.  \n  \nBefore the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) passed and got rid of preexisting conditions I spent a decent portion of my paycheck just maintaining insurance (that didn't provide proper coverage) because I had to maintain a certificate of credible insurability.  \n  \nThings have gotten a LOT better in the past few years but there's so much more that has to be done to help type 1 diabetics in the states it's absurd.","Honestly, reading the /r/diabetes subreddit is so incredibly depressing sometimes because people are making descisions based on money, not on quality of life.

I was diagnosed at age 9. I'm 30 now and i had surgery for retinopathy that in turn has caused me cataracts that will require more surgery.

This last &lt;8 months I've converted to pens.\n\nI'm not sure how my insulin ratio or whatever it's called compares to others, but because my ratio is tight I'd often draw a HAIR over 1 full unit, or under, or divide by halves, with the vial/syringe. This can't be done with pens, so much to my unhappiness and discontent I have a wider fluctuating range because I have to decide \"well, should I risk a low and do 2 units? or inject 1 and hope the high isn't too high?\" \n\n50% of the time I just eat 1, 2, 3, etc fruit snacks or whatnot or just eat slightly more to bump me up to the 2 unit amount, but when you eat 4+ times a day those small extra calories add up so I really don't like doing this.","I am curious on why you decided to use the pen and not a pump?","Honestly, a cure is unlikely. We don't understand autoimmune diseases well enough.\n\nHowever, treatment is getting better and better, and taking less input from the individual. The \"bionic pancreas\" that's hopefully coming in the next few years is a massive step in that direction. I was lucky enough to meet one of the guys involved in working with it and he told me stories about going to restaurants, ordering whatever he wanted, and not having to think about taking insulin, the pump did it for him. Incredible.","They've been talking about this bionic pancreas shit for years, though, including trials and patients wearing it outside of clinical settings, and stuff. It's been going on for a least a decade, with the same 5-years-away stuff being said the whole time. \n\nAs a type 1 consumer, it's just as much pie-in-the-sky for me as a cure. \n\nMaybe one of these days it won't be.","A glorified pump+CGM combo is not a cure for me. Islet cells, now that's more like it.","It's supposed to start clinical trials this fall, if I remember correctly. Quite a step.","That is mind blowing to me as a diabetic. Does he still test his blood sugar? Does it work by measure the spike in blood sugar? Have his numbers been steady since? ","They measure the spike in blood sugar and deliver insulin in response, but they aren't quick enough to work completely autonomously yet. You need to tell it what you're eating and it gives 75% of the dose right away and the rest later as necessary.","That's better than just pumping, but still, I'd rather my pancreas work itself and wish more money was given to cure researches. ","Definitely. But the viacyte implant looks very promising too.","He described the process to me. The first time you get put on it, you input your body weight (I believe that was it). From that point on, a CGM tracks your bloodsugar and provides microdoses of insulin and glucagon (they had gone as far as hiring a laboratory to create a more stable form of glucagon that could last outside of a refrigerator for weeks or months, can't remember the exact length of time). He told me that after the first day of being on it, his bloodsugar did not go above 200, regardless of what he ate. He was on it for a month. He said as far as insulin for meals went, the pump had 3 options: Below average meal, Average meal, and Above average meal. Didn't care about carb counting or anything. Very interesting.","Two of the possible side effects of vaccines (including the flu shot) are arthralgia (joint pain) and neuralgia (nerve pain); they're listed on the package insert that comes with the vaccine-my doctor showed it to me. \n\nSeveral hours after my last optional vaccine (for shingles) the joints in my hands and feet started to hurt. Then I got a 'pins and needles' sensation.\n\nMy doctor explained that the vaccine triggers the immune response which can misfire and cause inflammation of the joints and nerves.\n\nA year later and I still have both symptoms.\n\n","why do you think we won't be able to cure t1d? All you need to have are a transplant of functioning islets that can survive, you don't need to understand every possible trigger for the disease. There is some amazing research going on right now attacking the problem from all different angles, including modifying immune cells, transplanting islets in different locations in the body, and encapsulating islets to isolate them from invading cells. Once one of the many groups studying these finds an optimal combination we will in essence have a cure for t1d.","Because stopping the immune system is hard. I'd love a cure, I just don't think it's very likely to happen soon.\n\nAnyways, with stuff like the bionic pancreas coming along, diabetes will be little more than an afterthought if it works as well as I've been shown.","Having a bunch of electronics hanging off your body is not an afterthought. Having to refill the supplies all the time is not an afterthought. Not having enough space on your body to comfortably rotate pump sites is not an afterthought. Paying thousands of dollars a year in medical expenses even when on insurance is certainly not an afterthought. \n\nI agree with your skepticism regarding a true cure. But the \"bionic pancreas\" or \"artificial pancreas\" phrase pisses me off. There is so much hassle, inconvenience, challenge, and risk that comes with managing T1 diabetes, even if the pump/CGM combo gets smarter. ","Transplanting islet cells elsewhere in the body may be enough to trick the immune system, without the need to stop it. It might not work, but if it cures even just 10% of people to fully non-diabetic status, I'd call that a win. And if it cures no-one, maybe we get data out of it. Who knows.","&gt; Props for having a shot of an actual device we use, and not one of these 1950's syringes that seems to be taken out of stock pictures every time it is to be pictured.\n\nUp until a few years ago the BBC always used a picture of a lancing device wrongly on the front of the finger - something which has been known to be very bad since at least the 90s and strongly adviced against by all medical staff - they're slowly making progress.","I wish they made blood testing equipment that \"worked\" on something other than the fingertip.

To the googlemobile!","There are glucose monitors that allow you to use alternate sites. The main reason why most doctors suggest that you use your finger rather than your forearm or other sites is because the blood measured at the finger will provide a more up to date reading (my understanding has always been that fingertips have a greater need for a fresh supply of blood). Blood taken from other sites such as your forearm will show lagged results and so may provide an inaccurate reading which can be dangerous if you are experiencing a low blood sugar or are trying to adjust your insulin\n\nI used to use alternate sites in high school when I was playing volleyball (constantly pricking my finger was causing soreness) but I still recall that the monitor came with a warning that said if a user is experiencing low sugar symptoms, that they should measure from the fingers","Blood at the finger tips is always the closest to your real blood level, so if you feel low you should always test there.\n\nI've got a freestyle and always test on my arm (not tested on my fingers in years).

Gilead, for example, has essentially cured HepC with its drugs.","A scientist finding a cure for diabetes would almost be akin to the discovery of penicillin. Every scientist would want their name on that. That's just one incentive that conforms to the view that the progression of science is based on self-interest. But I really don't think it is.","You know what's even more expensive? Being the pharmaceutical company that isn't first to market with the cure.","Actually there's lots of incentive for a cure. Diabetes has been around so long that it's actually pretty cheap (comparatively) to treat. Someone comes up with a cure and could easily charge orders of magnitude more than the treatment, as long as it's less than the lifetime cost of treatment. For 20-25 years they have an exclusive right to produce the cure (or license it as they see fit) and make billions.\n\nAlso it's not necessarily pharma that's doing this research but universities and public health agencies who are in it for the bragging rights and the almost certain Nobel prize.

My insulin is jacked up to almost 100 bucks a vial, each test strip costs me WITH INSURANCE 5 bucks per strip. If I did the minimum 4 tests a day, that is 20 dollars a day. That's 140 per week.

Then I start getting severely sick in classes -- vomiting, excessive urination, the works.  \n\nI end up having to stay in my dorm suite because I'm so sick.  After three days of puking in a bucket and losing about 30lbs, I end up calling family and getting taken up to get checked out by a family doctor in the Beltway area.\n\nDiagnosed with, and treated for Type 1 Diabetes.  No history of it in the family.  Totally out of the blue.  \n\nI have had a rather complex theory for 25+ years as to how I may have contributed to its onset. \n\nI was athlete at the time and doing quite a bit of weight-training and weight-gaining. So, I drank a LOT of cow's milk -- gallon, gallon-and-half a day, particularly once I arrived at U.Va. (because of the dining halls and milk dispensers and so forth).  Soy milk wasn't even a thing at conventional grocery stores then; didn't exist at the dining halls either.  And, admittedly, I WAS also drinking alcohol heavily because I had been rushing and it was my first year at University and so forth.  \n\nSo here's my theory:  \n\nThe proteins in milk are supposedly identical to beta cells.  Some of these milk proteins somehow made it in to my circulatory system.  Naturally the immune system responded by killing these milk-protein \"invaders,\" but in doing so, killed ALL similar proteins in the system, i.e. the beta cells of the pancreas.\n\nYou'll ask:  \"But how did they make it in to your system?  That's ridiculous.  What did you do, inject yourself with ...milk?\" \n\nIt's not a popular subject in the medical community, but some speculate that \"leaky gut\" may been a factor.  I was drinking alcohol heavily because it was my first year at University and I was socializing etc., and excessive alcohol-consumption supposedly causes a degree of \"intestinal permeability.\"  \n\nSo, a potentially permeable intestine coupled with perhaps a bit of undigested cow's milk that it allowed in to my system, plus my immune system kicking in to kill it and (ta-dah) I'm suddenly Type 1 Diabetic.\n\nYou'll say:  \"Mmmm...but do you see a lot of little kids or teenagers who are diagnosed Type 1 who have a diet VERY heavy in the liquids you described?  No, but they still get diagnosed with Type 1, right? Average adults?  Pregnant women?   They still get diagnosed Type 1.\"  (Note: Well, I have seen a few children and pregnant women drink a good amount of cow's milk for bone health, and so forth).  \n\nSo, obviously, my theory might be a bit peculiar to me \n\n(Although I have also heard some speculate that, in addition to alcohol, certain medications and treatments can also lead to a degree of intestinal permeability.  Just a bit of undigested cow's milk makes it through in to one's system AND...   But, just a theory.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","Interesting, I was just dx'd t1 at the age of 28 and I was huge into milk and alcohol.

Are we certain type2 is caused by eating so much sugar or carbs and getting so fat our bodies stop producing insulin or absorbing it or did the chicken come before the egg? \n\nI believe it is possible that type2 could be genetic in some circumstances if not all. I think this way because obesity could be due to the failure of regulatory t-cells performing properly. Your body is meant to regulate your body weight. What would occur that would lead a person to ingest so many calories over a length of time to get this way and overide millions of years of evolution?

You can bet that the original publication isn't named with anything containing \"a complete picture\" or \"final piece of puzzle solved\".\n\nConsidering that there are many antigens involved in the autoimmune reactivity that causes the destruction of the insulin-producing cells, I'd also say that this study will be of relevance to some patients, although not all. Not everybody with diabetes will have autoreactivity against all the antigens that have been identified to associate with type I diabetes. I think that diabetes, just like in cancer, is moving towards more personalized medicine where it's important to distinguish between type I diabetes and type I diabetes, at least if we're trying to target the disease before it breaks out rather than fix the symptoms afterwards. Person A with diabetes I will have the same symptoms, but not the identical causes in terms of what antigen they're getting the auto-reaction against as Person B with diabetes I. For that reason, I think it's pretty important with studies like these even if they do not target the full repetoire of potential antigens in diabetes and even if they will not help everybody with type I diabetes. And even if this turns out to not fully cure/prevent the disease because it doesn't target the complete immunoprocess, it's possible that by intervening with part of the auto-reactivity- although you cannot block it completely- you'll manage to delay the destructio process and keep a decent part of the insulin production longer.","I am shocked that our own immune system which we thought was the one who fight back to intruders inside our body was also the one who attacks and destroys our own cells in the pancreas.","I remember there is a recent breakthrough where new beta cells were grown from stem cells, potentially allowing a cure for Type 1 diabetes, though the problem of immune cells attacking the beta cells in the first place could still be a problem.","&gt;Edit: I see a lot of people lamenting how breakthrough research never lives up to the hype. I look at it like this: If Reddit was around in the 1920's there would have been a post, Canadian researcher isolate small peptide from pancreas of dogs; use it to cure diabetes.\n\nIt's also worth noting that research doesn't have to 100% cure something to be useful and effective towards treatment.

A lot of women STEM-ers I have encountered are from the Middle East, India, China, Russia, Korea, and Eastern Europe.  I have read data that those regions have a higher rate of female participation in STEM too. \n\nI have also read studies where they gave Korean girls a math test.  In one case, they reminded the girls that they were female and the girls did poorly on the test.  In the next case they reminded the girls that they were Korean (as the stereotype is that Koreans are good at math), and the girls did well.  It's explained here in the [Stereotype lift and stereotype boost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat) section. \n\nAnyway, the title of this article is really misleading because it doesn't capture the entire study.  \n\nSidenote: r/science has nearly 11M subscribers. Wow. That's more than r/aww","I have an explanation for the higher rate of female STEM majors in the middle east: a friend of mine is over there teaching right now and she says since women are generally not allowed to work under most circumstances, they continue to attend school at a higher rate than men, who go off to work in various fields of study. This is helped by the fact that in certain middle eastern countries, students are given a stipend to continue to attend schools by the government. \n\nBut why STEM? This is a bit of a conjecture but my friend surmises that as far as getting a ticket out of the country and into a high paying job, this is their best opportunity. \n\nEven if they dont land a job out of the country, if they are lucky enough to be in a family that will let then work, they can have a better chance of having a higher paying job. \n\nI cant speak for India, China, or Korea, but I have noticed that Russians and Eastern European women do go after STEM fields as well, mostly economics and mechanical engineering. The best explanation I heard for this was that because of the communist revolution they have a longer visit of women being seen as equals han we have in the US. Anecdotally, most of the women from these areas ive met went into engineering or economics because their parents were engineers (both) during the communist era or because they wanted to work in a bank or a financial business, respectively.

We would expect that the gender ratio should approach equality as the proportion increases (obviously at 100% technical the gender ratio has to be at parity with the overall 2ndary education ratio).","As an EE girl currently studying STEM, here's the factors I attribute:\n\n• The \"girls are better at studying/more obedient\" stereotype. EE boys are known to be unruly: they might be good at something, but they're given more freedom by parents. Guys might be good, but girls are obedient, and can study and succeed where boys never put in effort. So a guy pressed by parents to become a doctor may or may not, but a girl will do it, and will study, and will get straight A's and bring pride to the family.\n\n• Soviet Union freedoms. It's totally true: I've been raised around female STEM people my entire life. My best friend's mother worked for Soviet rocket engineering, some of the things she knows are still classified. My parents were both good students, and thus both went into sciences. My grandmother was an accountant, and I watched her work when she babysat me. Women working was 100% normal for me, and knowing the hardheadedness of my female relatives, maths suited their (again) studious natures. \n\n•Essentially, studious has been female gendered instead of male in EE.\n\n•Women aren't supposed to do heavy work. Counting numbers isn't heavy.\n\n•Women are supposed to do something that lets them work from home, or spend time at home. See: grandmother.\n\n•Women need to bring in money because only mindless farmer women don't take advantage of free education and you don't want to live in a village carrying water and herding goats.","EE guy here and what you said about girls being obedient but guys being unruly is so true. a lot of guys around here have so much potential and if they apply themselves even a bit into trying to learn something, they do *very* well most of the time, the problem is that they can't, don't, or won't force themselves to do something that's the least bit like mental work. most prefer lugging around boxes to trying to achieve something in sciences.","This is a problem in many cultures, and one of the main contributors to girls out-performing boys academically,  especially where any sort of gang culture exists.

Then you try giving the same test to different groups, but how do you know one group doesn't just show better in tests overall?\n\nI'm sure there's ways to make them better and to account for these differences, but to do so on a scale that gives statistically significant results is much harder and to my knowledge has never been done.","&gt; You can't give people the same test obviously, so you give them a different one.

Hence why I said:\n\n&gt; I'm sure there's ways to make them better and to account for these differences, but to do so on a scale that gives statistically significant results is much harder and to my knowledge has never been done.","You give half the group one test and half the group the other test and then switch. Good sampling ensures the groups are equal.","The comment wasn't saying all studies on that effect are specifically flawed in some way.\n\nThe comment linked to data suggesting that overall, that effect might not exist, or might be much smaller than assumed. That doesn't mean all studies on it were flawed - some might be properly conducted, but they could still lead to the wrong conclusion, as even with the best scientific procedures, sometimes pure chance leads to false positives.\n","There's a really good Norwegian documentary about this called brainwash and episode 1 shows that the more gender equality in a country. The less likely for women go into engineering and the less likely for men to go into nursing. \n\nBut with economic pressure women will take higher paying jobs which are typically in the tech fields. \n\nDocumentary was so powerful that it outright caused the Norwegian government to close one of its gender equality branches as they also discovered that the scholarships that got a new influx of women going into engineering also ended up in those women not seeking engineering jobs. \n\nVery interesting stuff but will probably take our society an entire generation to accept we are different (assuming is true) just because we had to first push for equal treatment. ","One study I would really want to see is how many women in STEM have parents that have STEM degrees. Relatives such as uncle and so on would qualify to. ","And how many women in STEM have children.","That fact about gender equality is a bit counterintuitive. Any particular reason why?","In countries that are sufficiently prosperous and egalitarian, you are free to pursue the career and education you want. You can pursue a degree in art history or gender studies. You can work part time. You can afford to prioritize work-life balance, because even a modest income in such a country will pay for all your necessities and many luxuries. \n\nIn unequal countries, your career and education choices are fuelled by survival not pleasure. You choose a career based on the job market because you know that you may not have enough unless you get a great job. Do you love art and hate math? Tough shit because art isn't going to keep you a roof over your head.\n\n","So in short, you can't brainwash someone into choosing the life you want them to have.\n\nBut you can place them in an environment that demands they pursue the life they need to survive. \n\nThat's a really interesting prospect, and explains why dispite all of the \"women in engineering\" programs we have at my university, there are less than a douzen females out of 300 students on my course, and we pretty much take anyone who applies. People just seem too ready to act like that's a discrimination problem to pay attention to stuff like this.","The thing is I think when everyone says \"why are women discouraged from pursuing STEM\" inside that question, without accusation, is \"why do women not choose STEM\" and that's a broader cultural issue.","I think the assumption that the reason that women choose other fields over STEM is \"cultural\" is a pretty big assumption. \n\nWhy don't women choose STEM isn't even the question. It's \"why don't women choose a few narrow fields in STEM like physics, computing, and engineering\". Women are well represented in bio, psych, medicine etc. \n\nI think it's pretty clear that women tend to avoid the anti-social fields that involve spending long hours at the computer by yourself doing calculations and prefer fields with greater social interaction. \n\nThat doesn't sound cultural. That sounds like preferences based on personality and interest. ","Even if that were true it wouldn't manifest itself in this intense a way, women used to be much a much larger percentage of the people working CS. And this is back when you had to program directly in binary not social work in the least. then in the mid 1980s the number dropped precipitously, nothing *except* culture can account for that.","I mean, obviously I'm not the all-seeing holy ghost, but I've never actually witnessed a situation or even read of an actual situation in Western Europe where girls were discouraged from pursuing STEM courses. I have however read a *crapton* of stuff on special programmes for women, the importance of telling them that they can do it too, etc.\n\nAnd yet, in the end, I'm the guy studying engineering, and a large majority of girls I know are in social sciences, history, English, etc.","I live in a gender-equal country in Western Europe. I went to an all-girls school, and when we went to college, I was one of about 3 girls who went on to study a STEM course. The majority of girls went on to study teaching, or health courses such as nursing. \n\nI believe that this is because people want to do what they know. Everyone knows you can be a doctor, a teacher, a nurse, etc. so they choose these careers. \n\nThe reason I chose computer science is because I knew about it. My father studied computer science so I knew what was involved. \n\nOther than our careers guidance counsellors advising everyone to consider a STEM course, particularly engineering and computer science, nobody really had any idea of what was involved. This, in my opinion is why there are so few girls in STEM courses, in my country anyway.\n\nIn school there was little emphasis on STEM subjects. While maths was compulsory, most people did lower level. There is a much bigger emphasis on language studies. \n\nThere isn't enough emphasis on STEM in secondary/high school. It is a big risk doing a STEM course because students don't know much about it, students choose to study what they know.","&gt; While maths was compulsory, most people did lower level. There is a much bigger emphasis on language studies.\n\nSo that is obviously a problem, mainly if you actually have gender-segregated schools. \n\n(As an aside: In my personal opinion, sciences should be taught with a much higher priority at all schools anyway - in Switzerland for example (where I'm from, originally), the focus has been more and more on everything BUT sciences, and it's not like the average language skills have gone up that much... :/)\n\nHowever, to my knowledge, most countries in Western Europe have a majority of mixed-gender schools, no? In which case the question is still not satisfactorily answered, because one would expect the material taught to have a similar effect on both boys and girls.","Yes I agree with that! But I am also biased because I am better at sciences than languages, and was forced into studying languages when I would have prefered to study more sciences.\n\nI live in Ireland and there are both mixed-gender and segregated schools. Mostly the newer schools are mixed, while the older catholic schools are segregated. \n\nYes, I suppose. From my experience in school, there was only options to do \"girls subjects\" at my school, and the boys school up the road only had the option to do \"boys subjects\".\n\nThey had an opportunity to learn a little about Engineering and Computing which we never had.\nThis is where I think the problem (somewhat) comes from in my country.\n\nAnother big problem in Ireland specifically is that there are no courses in schools for computing or engineering, which leads to less people studying these subjects at university level in general and a high unemployment rate in a country that has HUGE employment opportunities in computing and engineering. But this is an issue regardless of gender. ","Perhaps people choose careers that they can envision themselves in. You might have chosen CS because your parents are in that field and it makes it easy to imagine yourself there. If a girl doesn't know any women in STEM personally, doesn't see many in the media in a positive light, and knows that not many women choose that career, she might not be able to imagine herself in STEM either. She may, however, know lots of nurses and teachers that are women. I would argue that one of the reasons these stereotypes are hard to break is that they're self reinforcing. I hope it will get better with time and lots of outreach by women in STEM.","I work in tech and I can tell you there is a huge amount of institutionalised sexism in this field. This, and the fact that society teaches girls that STEM is for boys (look at who certain toys are marketed at for example) is what discourages girls from entering these subjects, and that effect is enormously powerful.\n\nI'm sure it's also a factor that women are not as interested, but to pat ourselves on the back and say \"there's no problem here, women just don't like STEM\", as many are doing in this thread, is misguided.","Really? You've never noticed any time when girls were discouraged from pursuing engineering? I went to Caltech, and people still widely said shit like \"math is hard, let's go shopping\" as a joke. Stuff like that is not overt, but it definitely wears you down. When a test was hard, sometimes I would catch myself thinking that the reason it was so hard to me was *because I was a girl* and girls are just worse at math and science. Which is a ridiculous thing to think because I would often do better than other people in the end. \n\nA lot of people--even people at the top--suffer from impostor syndrome, and thinking you suck because of your gender is stupid, but it happens. That's why it's important to tell less represented groups that they *can* do it, because it's just one more reason for insecurity, and one more reason to convince themselves to give up.","&gt; I've never actually witnessed a situation or even read of an actual situation in Western Europe where girls were discouraged from pursuing STEM courses.\n\nI have. So have most girls I know who wanted to go into STEM, especially CS.","I'm always a little surprised when people point out how big the male majority is in STEM fields. \n\nI'm one of a tiny minority going on to do English Literature as a degree in a girls' school. Almost the entire year take Maths at A-Level, and over half are going on to do STEM degrees. They're all very talented people (we have quite a few going on to Oxbridge this year, and still more going to other Russell Group unis). \n\nI'm aware my sample size is tiny, but from my (very limited) surroundings I would not draw the conclusion that women are somehow naturally less suited to STEM subjects. I'm now curious to find out why that might be; perhaps it has to do with lots of parents doing STEM, or the way subjects are taught. We have a majority of female maths, science and DT teachers - I wonder if that subconsciously has an effect.","I understand that for the \"women going into engineering\" part, but what about the reverse, where higher gender equality leads to less men going into nursing?\n\nEDIT: So people seem to have misunderstood my comment. I'm referring to the comment 3 comments up which says that higher gender equality leads to less stereotype-defying choices like women going into engineering and men going into nursing, which is counterintuitive given that you would expect higher gender equality to lead to people being more willing to defy stereotypes. I am not talking about less men going into nursing than women, I am talking about higher gender equality reducing the number of men going into nursing.","Nursing is a well-paying job but there's kind of a stigma against men going into it, seems analogous to women and engineering.","nursing isn't that bad for male, try Elementary Education; we were 3 out of 150 entering students haha.","I don't know if there's necessarily the same stigma. There's a hell of a lot of \"women should join engineering\" stuff going around, and no \"male nurses are just as good\". Nursing is also one of the few professions to still keep gendered titles - matron, for example, is heavily gendered. There is no gender bias implicit in \"Dr.\" or a title any engineer might have. The fact that countries with more gender equality have less women choosing STEM seems to show that women just don't want to do those things.","&gt;...higher gender equality leads to less stereotype-defying choices like women going into engineering and men going into nursing, which is counterintuitive given that you would expect higher gender equality to lead to people being more willing to defy stereotypes. \n\nIt's only counterintuitive if you work from the assumption that gender stereotypes are complete social constructs with no basis in nature.  \nThat's really the \"correct\" point of view to take these days of course. The whole \"cavemen hunt and fight, cavewomen pick berries and raise children\" rhetoric has really fallen out of favour in the course of the fight for gender equality.  \n\nStill, that's basically the conclusion from those studies: There seems to be innate differences in what kind of work the different genders prefer. When you provide people with an equal and prosperous society, they will choose to do what they like, instead of what they feel they have to do to earn money.  \nNow, you can try to say that society discourages girls from pursuing STEM, but it seems to me like that claim is based on the fact that girls don't go into STEM, and nothing else.   \nHowever throughout my growing up, we were subject to an endless rain of propaganda to get girls into STEM. One would think liking maths as a girl would be grounds to become god emperor of mankind. And yet there are a total of something like 5 girls in my physics ~~department~~ classes.  \n\nI guess some time in the future we'll have to face the fact that there are more differences between the genders than what's dangling between our legs.  \nAnd no, I'm not saying girls can't be great at STEM. The smartest person I know is a girl. Hell, if you look at the stats here in Norway, girls do way better in school than boys. It's just that they don't go on to study STEM.","I agree.  There seems to be a lot of over thinking when it comes to issues of equality. Why don't more females study and go into STEM fields of employment?  Maybe they just don't want to.","Well, let's just be honest with ourselves, but higher gender equality typically only considers areas where women are disadvantaged.  Look at metrics of male well-being in those countries, such as suicide, homelessness, longevity, incarceration, etc., and it's far from obvious that they have achieved gender equality along those lines.  So it's not really a valid observation to suggest that it's higher gender equality that's making men shy away from nursing.","[removed]","[removed]","Without economic pressure, men and women make different choices, on average.","[removed]","It's probably worth noting that the documentary isn't really taken seriously by anyone in relevant scientific fields. It was criticised for heavy editing and misrepresenting the people it interviewed (go back and listen, and none of the people assigned to a \"blank slate\" position actually were blank slatists).\n\n&gt; Documentary was so powerful that it outright caused the Norwegian government to close one of its gender equality branches as they also discovered that the scholarships that got a new influx of women going into engineering also ended up in those women not seeking engineering jobs.\n\nThis was part of the advertisting for the documentary but there's actually no evidence to support it. After the documentary aired the centre remained open for nearly a year, where it finished up its contract. \n\nThey opened up bidding after that contract ran out and there was a bidding war over who would take over, ultimately being won by the University of Gothenburg and the Swedish Secretariat. This resulted in a massive funding increase, so they expanded the institute to form the Nordic Information on Gender which has been running strong since 2012.\n\nThe idea that the documentary forced the institute to be shut down makes no sense, given that it continued running until the end of its contract and when the contract was over, it was in high demand for new funders and expanded as a result.","What were the specific criticisms and who made them? ","My growing theory after decades in the tech industry is that the jobs people *really* focus on when they say \"STEM\" are CS/engineering jobs, and I think the real reason women tend to avoid or drop out of CS/engineering is those jobs just suck if you want anything out of your life other than a good paycheck. Workloads are terrible, often near-constant on-call time.\n\nFreakonomics did an interesting piece about the [gender pay gap](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-true-story-of-the-gender-pay-gap-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/) and one (female) Harvard economist claims that the biggest effect on the pay gap between men and women (in roles where this gap is significant) is that once women have children they value temporal flexibility more than higher pay, whereas men value higher pay.\n\n&gt; Some of the best studies that we have of the gender pay gap, following individuals longitudinally, show that when they show up right out of college, or out of law school, or after they get their M.B.A. — all the studies that we have indicate that wages are pretty similar then. So if men were better bargainers, they would have been better right then. And it doesn’t look as if they’re better bargainers to a degree that shows up as a very large number.  But further down the pike in their lives, by 10-15 years out, we see very large differences in their pay. But we also see large differences in where they are, in their job titles, and a lot of that occurs a year or two after a kid is born, and it occurs for women and not for men. If anything, men tend to work somewhat harder. And I know that there are many who have done many experiments on the fact that women don’t necessarily like competition as much as men do — they value temporal flexibility, men value income growth — that there are various differences. But in terms of bargaining and competition it doesn’t look like it’s showing up that much at the very beginning.\n\nThen when women have children this happens:\n\n&gt;  If you take women who don’t have caregiving obligations, they’re almost equal with men. It’s somewhere in the 95 percent range. But when women then have children, or again are caring for their own parents or other sick family members who need care, then they need to work differently. They need to work flexibly, and often go part-time. They often get less-good assignments because their bosses think that they’re not going to want work that allows them to travel, or they’re not going to be able to stay up all night, or whatever it is. And so then you start — if you’re working part-time, you don’t get the same raises. And if you’re working flexibly your boss very typically thinks that you’re not that committed to your career, so you don’t get promoted.\n\nAnd then this:\n\n&gt; when you correct for the stuff you can correct for in the Census, you find that the biggest wage gaps are in the corporate, the financial sectors, also law, and the health occupations in which there is a high fraction of ownership, of self-employment — so the podiatrists, for example, the chiropractors.  So, the ones that have the smallest difference between male and female earnings with these corrections are the technology occupations and the science occupations and the health occupations where there is a small degree of self-employment — as is true today for, for example, pharmacists.\n \nI really believe that a lot of what disincentivizes women from entering or staying in engineering fields are the same things that contribute to the pay gap in those fields: Those jobs have a lot of long, unpredictable hours, little true temporal flexibility, and an emphasis on salary over work-life balances. Frankly if you want anything out of your life other than a paycheck, they're just not good jobs.\n","This is definitely a powerful argument in third wave feminist groups. Probably because it's right? I'd be interested to see how labor policies in high equality countries compares to the gendering of STEM roles. Would you find better ratios where labor has greater strength and accommodation for child rearing is allowed? There's also the expectation of Mom taking care of sick kids vs Dad taking care of sick kids. Some men have described being pressured into not helping out their families because men shouldn't be taking time off work to care for kids.\n\nIt's interesting and I'm glad to see more than \"See lolz girls are just girls and boys are boys and we're so much smarter, that's why we choose STEM hahaz\" on here. \n\nThanks for the study link!","I read an interesting thread on a forum for MDs once. They were discussing how women entering the field in higher numbers is affecting the field. They said that women are working fewer hours (meaning probably 45-50 hours a week instead of 60+) and spending more time with their family. Some of them were framing this as a negative thing, but I thought it was interesting that women are changing the field to be more friendly to people who have a life outside of work. I wonder if more women do decide to go into CS/engineering if that field will change. ","That is one of the reasons I want to see many more women in STEM fields, especially CS.  As soon as they get up to 30-40% of the workforce there will be a dramatic change to working conditions.  Society does not allow women to be treated as poorly as it treats men, there would be a massive push to change the labour laws when more women are affected by the poor working conditions.","A white female engineer is incredibly rare.

In highly equal countries, women have real options, while in less equal countries, they are \"forced\" to choose the more lucrative STEM fields because money is the great equalizer.","&gt;In contrast with what many believe, parents in more developed countries placed a stronger emphasis on the mathematical development of their sons than their daughters\n\nMust have kinda just missed that there huh","Yeah, that seems like kind of a critical point that everybody's ignoring.

I think it's dangerous to make assumptions based on a fairly limited study (not that the study itself is bad, but we're talking well beyond its scope) but if I were to do so, in less developed (developed in this context meaning gender equality development) countries, income generation for the family is often placed on the son. Because of this, most of the family's excess resources are also devoted to the son(s). If we accept the idea that more resources (attention, help, financial, emotional, ect) leads to better outcomes, then we might be able to suggest that boys in less developed countries have greater expectations and a high need for ROI from their STEM education than girls. If we go a step farther and look at WHERE gender equality is greater, we're looking at post-Soviet or third world countries where manufacturing and heavy industry remain the primary source of income. Those also require STEM education if you plan to make any money.\n\nI would suggest that in countries where men/women are less equal, it's the need for a return on investment that adds greater stress to men and math anxiety.

At the time, I would laugh along at it too (maybe as an attempt to fit in as \"one of the guys\"), but looking back on it now, those kinds of comments really contributed to my lack of confidence in myself. I've been lucky in that I've never been overtly discriminated against or worse, harassed, but comments like that really wear on you. When a test was hard, sometimes I would catch myself thinking that the reason it was so hard to me was because I was a girl and girls are just worse at math and science. Which is a ridiculous thing to think because I would often do better than other people in the end.\n\nNow that I'm working (still in STEM), a lot of the older engineers will say things that are somewhat sexist, but I feel too scared to call them out on it since they're more senior. This kills my confidence at times.\n\nHonestly, if I didn't have a chip on my shoulder and the absolute drive to prove people wrong (whether imagined or not), I might have given up long ago.\n\nIf I had advice to you for your daughter... for God's sake, make her understand that there's no reason that her gender makes her any worse or better at math.

The data itself doesn't really help show why girls feel more anxiety in general though.","[removed]","[removed]","Is it really surprising when girls are treated as \"females\" rather than humans so terribly often in those fields?

That's what this study is completely overlooking.","As a woman from a high gender equality country, I'd just like to point out that it is still a very young concept. We still have to deal with the gender ideas of our parents and grandparents generations, which can be very restrictive. \n\nThe presumption that girls are naturally bad at math is something that girls are also aware of, and there is anxiety from feeling like you have to represent your entire gender in your performance and constantly having to prove your worth to your male colleagues.","Girls outperform boys in school, teachers are predominantly women, and women are getting more college degrees than men by a large margin. A lot of boys are diagnosed with ADHD and put on medication.\n\nWe seem to react differently to boys falling behind than girls falling behind. ","&gt; We seem to react differently to boys falling behind than girls falling behind \n\nI can't speak to STEM subjects as they're not my forte, but as a teacher and recent teachers college grad (Canada) there is definitely a reaction right now in education to boys falling behind in literacy; school aged boys pretty consistently read less and at lower levels than girls, and there was a lot of discussion during my time in teachers college on strategies to change that. Just to put my 2 cents in that there might not be much reaction to boys falling behind in STEM subjects just yet, but there definitely is in other subjects.","Teachers are predominantly women because that's a caregivers role. Women earn degrees because they aren't doing trades.","This sounds like a girl falling behind is society's fault, a boy falling behind is his fault. I hope that's wrong. ","This needs to be way higher up.  These types of changes take *time*, and lots of it.  Not because attitudes take time to change, but because it takes time for the effects of that attitude change to filter through the system.  Even if we could magically make females more interested in maths and engineering right now, there is still a massive lack of female role models in the higher positions of these fields.  There will still be the pressure from the older generations to conform to what they perceive as \"a women's role or job\".  It's only when the first few generations come through and create those role models that we'll start seeing a big change.  And then the next generation more still.  This will take 80 years to properly manifest, so worrying about it not happening overnight is silly.\n\nThe same situation exists in every other area where we've only recently seen attitude equality exist.  Why aren't there many female CEOs?  Simple - the vast majority of CEOs are older males, 60+ in age.  They've been working for 40 years, slowly going up the chain.  Which means they started in the 70s and 80s, when the concept of the \"stay at home mom\" was certainly still a very big thing.  So there are simply far less qualified women in companies that have the necessary experience to *be* a CEO.  Now that attitudes have changed, I fully expect this to slowly shift towards equality over the next few generations now that women are making up almost 50% of the workforce.\n\nLook at any industry that was male-dominated in the past, and you'll see the same thing - still lots of men at the top, but over time the women will slowly push them out.  Medicine is another great example.  Back in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, men made up 80% or more of medical school graduates.  So it's no surprise that men now hold 80% or more of the top positions in hospitals.  Today, there are slightly more females graduating from medical school than males, so *in 40 years*, when they reach the top of their professions, I would fully expect to see them outnumber men.  Expecting it to happen *now* is ridiculous.\n\nYes, I think more women will come into STEM careers, but it will be a very slow process, and trying to artificially force it to happen faster may be counter-productive.  My university has also spent millions trying, and it seems to be mostly wasted.","I don't understand.\n\nI'm also a woman from a high gender equality country. Why should the \"ideas\" of my parents and grandparents inhibit my learning and thus, desire to succeed in a STEM field? You should have the bodily autonomy to decide for yourself what you're interested in. \n\nI'm majoring in Cyber security. No one \"conditioned\" me into it. Society didn't thrust me into the world of STEM, nor did they shield me from it.\n\nI made a decision, something ALL women are capable off, legally and otherwise.\n\nIt's a cop-out, a lazy conclusion to come to, to postulate that women are underrepresented in STEM because of *society* and ideals from older generations. It's insulting to women to imply that we can't make informed decisions because of the world around us.\n","&gt;The presumption that girls are naturally bad at math is something that girls are also aware of\n\nWhat??? ","I know, growing up I always heard boys are worse at school than girls. ","Pretty sure the girls in my schools were the top of the class in grades... well, from the beginning till university. And even when I was studying IT girls were usually the better ones in math and physics, even though there were very few of them.","Yea, it was always girls that were better at everything in elementary school. \n\nIsn't the easiest explanation that most girls are just not interested in IT related things? There are some, but probably less than boys. We have programs promoting Girls in IT in my university and it's still mostly just boys. \n\n","Yeah growing up we were always led to believe girls were naturally smarter and matured faster.","Mathematics gives everyone equally crippling anxiety","exactly my thoughts as well. Obviously I don't have a magic solution, but I think overall we need to empower people in mathematics instead of breaking them down into this crippling anxiety. Instead of teaching people the inherent beauty of mathematics to describe and model the complex world around us, it seems we are often reduced to attempts to \"weed out\" or \"tease out\" those who are \"good\" or \"bad.\" It makes me sad, because there seem to be many people out there that don't seem to realize their own potential because they get 'C's on obscure common-core-type math exam (because they screwed up a term in the quadratic formula, which they were instructed to memorize for some reason that they don't understand) and then just say \"well I guess this just isn't for me!\" since Jimmy keeps getting 'A's. Sure, some people definitely slack off and don't deserve good grades, but I feel we could improve people's interest in, appreciation for, and, of course, abilities in mathematics if we just tell them that they **can** do it with a little bit of effort and curiosity!","In actuality,girls outperform boys in all subjects at all ages.

You can't apply bell curve type statistics and generalizations to individuals, because when anecdotal evidence counters the generalized population statistics, then the whole thing must be sexist. \n\nAnother very important issue nobody has discussed here, and I'll share it with you since you seem reasonable, is that to excel in STEM fields, you would probably need an IQ of greater than 115, and since the female IQ normal curve is more narrow, there are simply fewer in TOTAL NUMBERS of women under that area of the curve. In the genius IQ range, men outnumber women 8 to 1, but at the other end of the curve, really DUMB people, men outnumber women 8 to 1. Someone above said that there are more female Asians in STEM, they are, ON AVERAGE, smarter than white women, so that segment of the high-IQ population is larger. \n\nIQ tests aren't sexist.

At the moment, my position is that maybe, just *maybe* there is actually some truth to the old 'boys play with tractors, girls play with dolls' cliche - maybe guys just are more interested in STEM fields. You can't help but notice that where women are free to choose to do whatever, they overwhelmingly don't choose Engineering.\n\nI mean, I also don't see this as a problem. As long as the women who *do* want to do STEM *can* do it - and usually, guys here have nothing but respect for girls actually going for it -, I really don't understand what the big issue is.","Why do we keep saying \"STEM\" but then only focusing on \"E\"?\n\nThere are a lot of women in Medicine, for example.\n\nIn fact some research I heard discussed the other day claimed that retail pharmacists are one of the few roles that have become roughly equally distributed between men and women, the author largely attributing that to the fact that because a retail pharmacist is so \"cookie cutter\" so easily replaced in a shift by another one, that retail pharmacists have significantly more \"temporal flexibility\" than many other better paying jobs in medicine. If you need to work part-time, it's possible. If you need to have your shifts adjusted because of child-care or elder-care issues, it's possible.\n\nThis researcher also found that at around the age where women tend to start acquiring more care responsibilities (caring for children or parents) is the time of life when the pay difference between them and their peers in the same roles starts to rise. The women are more likely to trade the higher-paying low-temporal-flexibility job for a lower-paying one, even in the same/similar field, that allows more flexibility in their schedule.\n","Well... STEM = Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics. Medicine is not always even considered to be a part of that, some people for example use the acronym STEMM to include it.\n\n(Your last paragraph btw is a good explanation for the famous 'wage gap', which really does not come down to women being paid less than men for the same job with the same qualifications.)","Why is Medicine not considered part of Science?

Anthropology isn't really an empirical science compared to Biology, Chemistry and Physics and I'm pretty sure it's not included in STEM. Not sure if fields like Archaeology, Geology perhaps and other earthly Sciences are included though.","Forensic anthropology and physical anthropology aren't empirical sciences? Then what was the point of all that genetic analysis and detailed skull measurements they do?\n\nArchaeology is a lot more \"soft\" than branches of Anthropology are.\n","Because Medicine isn't really a science? A doctor treats patients, performs surgeries, etc., whatever the specialisation might be.

Although highly important and not easy, a lot of medical fields don't have that opportunity. That said, there absolutely are some medical professions that I would put under the \"science\" bracket of STEM.","M is Mathematics, not Medicine\n\nScience, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics","It depends on where you see women pursuing STEM courses. Are they in university? Are they 13, 14, 15?\n\nThis is an anecdote regarding upper schooling in Australia, related by someone who seems to have a genuine interest in removing social barriers for women. They had a boy and a girl, both in prestigious private schools. The boy was older. He chose a maths course in high school that was difficult that would lead to a STEM career if he chose one. The end. The girl chose the same course, when she was old enough. She was told it was very difficult. Her parents (one being the guy who told me this) were called in for interviews at the school before she commenced the class. The school reiterated how difficult the class was. With parental support, the girl took the class. Both boy and girl graduated university with degrees in STEM fields, but the girl experienced much more dissuasion. It might be different where you are. But where I am, there is still social pressure on women that men aren't exposed to. It's the social pressure that needs to go, so both genders can choose a career path suited to their preferences and academic abilities.","Yeah that's not alright, and I can see how that would lead to fewer women taking up subjects that lead to STEM fields. (Btw I don't think school should restrict your later choices in life at all, I believe in school as a general preparation for whatever you go on to do later - but that's a different subject).\n\nI have not heard of something like that happening here though. I can imagine obstacles like that existing anyway, BUT: does that really explain the fantastically low number of women in Engineering? (The numbers are even lower if you only look at students actually born and raised in Europe.) Is that kind of dissuasion really the norm in all of Europe?","I don't know about Europe and wouldn't presume to assume anything about European education. I merely wanted to point out the some places do still exert societal pressure on girls when it comes to STEM fields.\n\nIn Australia, you choose subjects in high school at about age 16, which direct you towards your choices from there. You can choose non-university directed courses and sit an exam later if you later decide you  want to go to university, so it's not a definite choice but it's still a major one.","I imagine this effect would be even stronger in countries with less gender inequality. ","It probably would be, but I still don't agree with discouraging females from pursuing STEM fields based on their gender.\n\nI also don't agree with discouraging males from taking up \"female\" jobs like teaching or nursing. I also think we need to admit if there is any societal pressure applied before coming to the conclusion that one gender (not individuals thereof) may be more inclined towards a particular job. I personally think it is more due to personal inclination than gender as to what job people are suited to, but it's not an easily measurable statistic when factors other than gender are present.","When is that that women are free to choose entirely outside the influence of social and cultural factors? because one of the most heavily gendered parts of american culture is the toy industry, literally the first 'thing' a young child interacts with.\n\nEdit: I don't choose the toy example lightly the Toy industry can be pretty closely implicated to the steep drop in women pursuing CS in 1984. [Here's](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/17/356944145/episode-576-when-women-stopped-coding) a very good report on the subject if you've got a few minutes. It's a podcast though so if you're in public you might not be able to listen","I can't listen to the podcast, what are their reason for choosing the toy industry specifically?","can you see the graph? if you can you notice there's a massive drop in 1984 in women going into CS, essentially right around the time that home computers started becoming widely available. Since computers were very weak at the time they could only really be used to play games. So they were marketed as toys, but if you've seen any toy commercials recently you'll notice that, in that industry, things are almost always either 'for boys' or 'for girls'. \n\nSo computers became 'for boys' because of this really arbitrary marketing decision. Now because of that boys were the ones who mostly had computers at 14, so they were the only people who were learning programming on their own, meaning they had a massive advantage over women going into CS.\n","Do they call out any specific ads during that time? I just googled for old computer ads and most of them weren't gendered at all. I found maybe one which was specifically targeted at men, but the others mostly emphasized how much you can do with it, how much easier your life is gonna be when you own a PC and how your whole family would benefit from it. During the first years of computers it wouldn't even make sense to market them to kids since many cost upwards of 1000$ (which is like a billion in today's money) - they tried to establish it like an appliance so there'd be one in every household. Even when you look at C64 ads which was relatively inexpensive most ads show how it is useful for the whole family and everybody will be able to use it. ","I don't see it either.  At best you could claim that it was acceptable for boys to sit in the basement and have no friends while poking this electronic contraption.  They were not toys at the time even if you could use some of them for games they were not strictly games and usually required some coaxing.  It was a gadget and not a toy.\n\nIn retrospect if you had told me that I was on the path to living my live tied to a text console spending long hours chasing down obscure bugs I may have run screaming.  It's fun when things work, but being a miracle worker gets old quick.","Yeah they do, mostly T.V. since that's more audio-friendly. it wasn't exactly like a toy it was something for boys to do with their dad, but it was marketed like a toy just a very sophisticated one. \n\nAlso I'm not sure what research /u/RealUgly is referring to but this broadcast isn't a popular argument, it's based of the work of a researcher in the history of tech who's interviewed thousands of CS students. I'm not quoting mother jones here.","The toy argument is actually a funny one for /u/sketchyhippopotamus to make considering how it is addressed in the documentary called \"Brainwash.\" Interesting research being done on newborns by Ali G's brother.\n\nIt's a popular argument for why society is to blame for women not choosing STEM, but it assumes without evidence that toys are not designed and produced for boys and girls because they tend to like different toys, but that toy companies actually control and influence those preferences absolutely. It's a bit absurd.\n\nAlso I don't have the time to go into it, but essentially their comment about computers is also a half truth that omits exactly what was considered a \"computer.\" Hint: typewriters","&gt; but it assumes without evidence that toys are not designed and produced for boys and girls because they tend to like different toys,\n\nBoys and girls used to like Lego. Now it has since fallen into the \"toys for boys\" camp, for no reason.\n","When has it ever done that? They only started selling more gendered versions of their toys with extra parts (e.g. a princess castle or firetrucks).","For decades, dolls were purely the domain of 'girls toys' then the action figure came along. for most action figures their is no practical difference between them and a doll, the only difference was action figures were 'for' boys to play fight with. There is nothing inherent about the doll that makes it for boys or girls only the marketing","There are very clear differences between action figures and dolls. Just compare a female GIJOE to a Ken doll. Let me know when Ken comes with an AK and a Bowie knife and can be adjusted to perform a realistic roundhouse kick.\n\nIf you're so determined to make your argument that you're denying differences a 5 year old can recognize then I'm not sure why you're even trying to interact with people you disagree with.

My first tech support job, the manager who hired me was a woman, who was also one of the programmers and managed the team of programmers about 3 of 6 of whom were women. One of the two installation support (people who went to customer sites to install/train on the product) was a woman. Through the early 90s in Silicon Valley I encountered more women in tech roles at various small companies, often in hiring position. I even worked for a female CIO in the mid-90s.\n\nBut right around the time of the tech bubble really growing, I stopped seeing new female programmers. By 2000, virtually every woman I knew in the technology departments was in Quality Assurance or in one case Release Engineering. By the time the bubble burst and layoffs had shrunk staff to near skeleton screws that worked long hours and were on-call constantly, developer and IT operations staff were pretty much the boys club they still get accused of being today. For the next 15 years that pretty much remained consistent. I mostly only encountered women in QA, project manager, and sometimes IT management roles (usually promoted up from QA).\n\nMy current employer makes significant effort to make sure they are getting as diverse a candidate pool as possible (blind code submissions just being one of them) and again I can only note anecdotally that I have more female co-workers in programming roles at this job than any since the early 90s.

Have you ever used a lawyer? I have quite a few times now. The legal system is a game of \"who pays the lawyers most wins\".

These less glamorous jobs are left to the men and no one seems to be concerned about it, including myself. The fact is that men are generally stronger (upper body, as we all know) and have been found to be less risk averse. Another controversial fact, a fact being something that shouldn't really be controversial, is that spatial reasoning has been found to be better in males, this may have something to do with STEM proficiency, possibly explained by evolutionary requirements for hunting.  Even without an explaination, I fail to see anything wrong with these proportions.

Does increased equality increase women's options but not men's?\n\nIs there something about women that makes them less likely to choose STEM if they can choose something else, and if so is it culturally driven or biologically driven? And if men are more likely to choose STEM, is that choice culturally or biologically driven?","I don't understand why people always go to discrimination to explain inequality. like, I assume you have met both males and females, is doing STEM the only things men are more likely to do? men and women are often quite different.\n\nwe already know different gender often causes different behaviors. so why when we see different behaviors in different genders are we so afraid to connect the dots see a likely connection?","Did I go to discrimination? I'm confused because I thought I established that the real question is whether it is discrimination or some biological difference.\n\nJust because the genders are different in some ways doesn't mean every place there's inequality we can \"connect the dots\". We have to find some way to prove it is or isn't because of discrimination. If you go around saying \"men just like STEM more\" but you have no proof, that is discrimination.","My point basically is, because 'natural' causes for inequality turns out to be true 9 times out of 10 in western society, it should be the default answer - it should be considered true until we have evidence to the contrary.\n\nA more extreme case for clarity: although it is not proven, due to previous experience we can say the loch Ness monster probably isn't real (at least for the sake of discussion). In this case asking \"is this a picture of the loch Ness monster or not?\" Is pretty misleading. The answers are in no way equally likely and the question presents them as such, intentionally or not.","You say 9 times out of 10, is that backed up by data? \n\nI only ask because there have been numerous times throughout history where people have used the \"it's natural argument\" to discriminate against minorities.

You're equating the loch ness monster, something that has *never* had evidence supporting it, to a discussion of discrimination, something we know for a fact exists, whether or not it applies to this situation.\n\nAgain, I'm *not* trying to say this is a case of discrimination, just that it is far more likely to be than the existence of the loch ness monster. \n\nAnother important thing to note here is that it doesn't matter if the loch ness monster exists. It does matter if this situation is caused by discrimination because if it is we can change it. If it's not we could at least change our attitudes towards it.\n\nOne thing I know to be true is that even if women, as a whole, are less likely to want to work in STEM, the ones that do want to work in those fields often face discrimination and/or harassment because of their gender. Maybe fixing that won't change the proportions of women in STEM, but I would argue it would still be worth fixing. ","I say 9/10 because its a saying. I just mean most of the times. And not it's not backed up by studies its just what we see in the world. You just tend to not notice most of them. If you'll just list all diffrences youll see this pretty fast, we just see most of them as trival.\n\nAnd I don't use this arguments to discriminate, that would be absolutely reprehensible. I just use it to explain differences instead of assuming somebody somewhere must be discriminating.\n\nAlso seeing discrimination in places where there isn't just causes over compensation, which is just discrimination for the other groups. We should avoid over compensation just as much as discrimination.\n\nI completely agree that the loch ness monster is a much much more extreme case, but it was just to ilustrate the concept. I do not think discrimination is a myth.\n\nI also completely agree we should stop discrimination when we know it's there. I just argue we shouldn't be quick to see inequalities as evidence of discrimination, as it is often just evidence of cultural or biological difference.","&gt; Does increased equality increase women's options but not men's?\n\nIt might be that, or it might be that increased equality increases the viability of options that women would prefer, but men do not.\n\nIt *might* be like handedness and scissors: the availability of left handed scissors would have significant impact on the behaviors/choices of left handed individuals, but has virtually no bearing on the choices of right handed individuals. &lt;/conjecture&gt;","That's certainly an interesting proposition. My one issue is that you've limited it to a dichotomy, ie the only choices are left or right.\n\nWhat if it went from the only choice is right-handed scissors to choosing between left-handed, right-handed, exacto knife, boxcutter, etc but men still only felt like right handed was a good choice for them while women felt like they could choose any of the options based on their circumstance.\n\nThat's not necessarily a problem, but I would certainly like to know why it's the case before deciding if I think it's an issue or not.

When I was a kid, I used to like reading books, writing, making art, and other humanities stuff. In high school, my family always told me that I suck at the humanities and that I should avoid it because I'm bad at it, so obviously I ended up in STEM. When I got to college, I found out that I don't suck at the humanities. \n\nIf you tell somebody that they're bad at something all the time, they're going to hate that thing and do poorly at it (even if they're not inherently bad at it), because they won't be putting 100% effort into something they hate, and thus will always perform worse than people who *are* trying. And if they tried, they're always anticipating another round of criticism about why they suck, so obviously they'd be anxious. \n\nThe article was right when it said that developed countries make things worse. My culture (from a developing country) doesn't have a \"girls are bad at math\" stereotype.

This is completely anecdotal, but i'm a guy and i've pretty much always done exactly what i was interested in despite having no encouragement and often explicit discouragement.\n\nI think it's naive to dismiss nature when it's the underlying biology that allows the \"nurture\" part to exist in the first place. Why are we not comfortable applying the same principles to humans that we do to other animals? I think a bottom-up approach is much more likely to yield accurate answers, and as long as we ignore that and continue to believe that we can socially engineer more \"equality\" while ignoring biological explanations, we will come up with these ineffective policies and programs that inevitably magnify the discouraging stereotypes such as \"girls are bad at math\". \n\nThe problem is that while studies continue to show behavioral differences between the sexes, social scientists are scrambling to explain it in terms of cultural influences without caring to examine the basic units from which those influences arise.","You may be right that nurture is bigger than nature, but the problem is that ideologically, people want nature to have 0 impact.

A claim to know with certainty the whole truth of such things is really just a sign of goal directed reasoning and a poor understanding of biology.","I'm just worried that by fearing a specific outcome we will fallaciously discount research that suggests that outcome.  We may not be able to know the truth with certainty, but that doesn't mean we can't build our understanding with the best tools we have available.  The truth may well be that behaviors are largely due to biology, and if this is the case, we need to be careful in how we use this information.  By cultivating fear of this outcome, we discourage  reasonable and catious people from researching it, ensuring that reckless and perhaps nefarious  people will have a monopoly on information derived from this perspective.  An understanding of the relationship between biology and behavior could have vast and helpful implications for developmental psychology and education, but could also be used by others for sinister purposes such as genocide motivated by eugenics; I would guess that people interested in the former far outnumber those who would advocate the latter, and I would argue that your mindset would only discourage research by those in the former group, while those with more sadistic aims would continue their work unconcerned of the rational apprehension you bring up.\n\nEdit: a word","&gt; fearing a specific outcome we will fallaciously discount research that suggests that outcome\n\nI firmly believe the types of outcomes that are dangerous will never be rationally justified by ethically conducted scientific research. There's no reason to fear data collected ethically. What's troublesome is often the interpretation of the data, sometimes by the researcher, and more often by members of the public seeking to justify a pre-existing belief. Some of the responsibility to discredit uninformed perspectives falls on researchers themselves as well as journalists.\n\n&gt; The truth may well be that behaviors are largely due to biology\n\nI think it's safe to say that behaviors are entirely due to biology. The mistake is thinking that biology itself is deterministic. The idea that everything we are is set in stone by genetics or some other internal/innate mechanism. The truth is that behaviors are adaptive and plastic, so is your personality, so is your brain. Group differences can be explained by societal pressures yada yada yada.\n\nTake it from me, and rest assured: If by 'behaviors' you mean things like IQ or spatial performance, affinity for sports or physical activity, academics, etc., and by biology you mean static things like what chromosomes you have or what your genetic background is, then the truth is almost certainly NOT that such behaviors are largely due to biology. These behaviors are too complex to be the direct result of those static things. They are shaped over time due to the complex interaction between a developing human and their environment.\n\n&gt;I would argue that your mindset would only discourage research by those in the former group, while those with more sadistic aims would continue their work unconcerned of the rational apprehension you bring up.\n\nLike I said, I don't have a problem with the ethical research of anything. Even social constructs like race and gender that have no place greater non-human biology can offer valuable tools for understanding our society itself. Research by people who are untrained is not ethical and poses a significant risk to all involved, regardless of their intent.

For example, intelligence is largely genetic, but can be develop in different ways on the basis of environment, and the more we understand both the roles of genes and environment, the more we will be able to work around maladaptive genetic predispositions and harmful environments to improve the lives and skills of individuals under these infouences.  I agree completely with your description of the interaction between genes and environment.  In our initial encounter I mistook you for the sort of person who would discount all biological influence and argue that culture dictates everything, and then you mistook me for someone who believes the opposite of that.

Computers at the time were very weak and couldn't do much useful except play basic games, so they were marketed as toys, and because Kid's toy marketing is so heavily gendered computers became 'a boy thing.' When parents bought computers they bought them for boys and when the games lost their luster they started to program. So boys going to college for programming often came into the program already knowing how to program while girls didn't.\n\nthere was one computer science college president who gets a lot of human interest in the story, apparently she was a math whiz who everyone said would do great things. she recalled her first computer science course in the 80s. It was literally like programming 101 or something, but despite that all the guys in the class already knew how to program and the professor actually scolded her for not knowing programming in her intro to programming class. She actually changed majors because of it, though she at least ended up going back.\n\nLike it's such a small thing, kid's toy marketing, but it hugely affected the demographic of an entire generation of programmers.

I didn't get to really start messing around with computers until I was about to graduate HS.  I dabbled a bit and considered going into programming but figured I was already too far behind the curve.  That was because of being poor and going to a small, rural school though.  I'd read about richer schools having actual computer labs and courses.  Rich people even had them at home.  There I was still using a type writer in school with my only real computer time being hanging out in the library.  \n\nThere certainly was the expectation that you would be familiar with the basics.  Then again, a lot of fields are like that in college.  There is the expectation in college that you are aware of the fundamentals of the subject.

Go into an automotive repair course and they expect you to at least be familiar with what a car is.  \n\nProgramming is in a weird spot because it is not widely taught in schools and as technology has improved there is less motivation for kids to pick it up on their own.  Now they do offer actual beginner courses in college out of necessity.

In addition to that, many of the women who do go into STEM leave because of the negative stereotyping they face in the field.\n\n&gt;It's a cop-out, a lazy conclusion to come to, to postulate that women are underrepresented in STEM because of society and ideals from older generations.\n\nNo one lives in a vacuum, I would argue that it's short-sighted to say culture and the people around us makes zero difference.","Yeah, we're not there yet.","Can confirm.

In western countries girls are encouraged to do girly things from a young age, most of their friends do girly things, and doing not girly things will make you a loner/outcast in your social group.\n\nWhen a girl goes to college, all her friends are going into non STEM fields and if she chooses to go into a STEM field she will be in a class with mostly boys (i.e. not friends).\n\nI think the biggest obstacle for gender equality here is not what we encourage children to do, but who we encourage children to be friends with.  For some stupid reason it is socially unacceptable for boys and girls (especially as kids) to actually just be friends.  If we can break this social stigma, I think it will go a long way towards fixing gender equality problems.","Many inner city people buy into the same 'follow your dreams'  crap or worse fall for a 'career college'. ","There's nothing incompatible with a broadly derived cultural norm of \"do what drives your passions\", borne from societal wealth, and that having an effect on the relative (key word) poor people in that society adopting that cultural norm.

","I mean I don't think /u/Visinvictus was at all suggesting a conspiracy theory here. They were just suggesting a different set of societal norms causing this issue, one which happens to focus on gender rather than narratives about success. \n\nAnd then you go off the rails and accuse them of believing in conspiracy. Porque no los dos? Both sets of norms can play a part in this issue on varying degrees, and still not be a conspiracy.","because his claimed theory is a cultural matter that results in one sex systematically being forced by society into defined roles, albeit by an innocuous process of \"not having friends\"\n\nthe other ones aren't\n\nyou can see which one pushes a narrative that \"something needs to be done\" to remedy the imbalance within the culture, can't you?

I'm in STEM, and the gender inequality sucks. So, not sure how the narrative that the root cause is \"freedom of choice and lack of economic pressure\" or \"societally enforced gender roles\" pushes one thing or the other.","what problem do you identify? \n\nbut, yes, socially-enforced gender roles pushes affirmative action programs to the detriment of males in a way that freedom of choice and lack of economic pressure does not. \n\n\n","Not necessarily. They push a need for a solution, and while the most direct solution is affirmative action-esque, it may not be the best one. \n\nThere are plenty of ways we can start fixing gender inequality. The simplest one is for each of us, individually, to stop perpetuating gendered stereotypes and social norms. That's what a lot of this dialogue is about - just getting people to start questioning their assumptions about other genders (and their own).\n\n","Nobody is forcing their kids into defined roles, it is a lot more subtle than that. Kids get their interests from three primary sources: parents, teachers and peers.  If parents are all passing on a lot of gender stereotyped interests to their kids, and the kids only make friends with their own gender, then you pretty much have a recipe where boys and girls are going to have different interests.  Combine this with a \"follow your dreams\" culture, and you end up with the situation we have today where girls don't go into STEM.","In any instance where parents push their children for any specific outcome the anxiety of the children towards that outcome will be higher.  Any time that a parent pushes their child toward a specific goal it creates more fear in that child of disappointing their parents.\n\nI do not know about all the countries, but in China there is a specific reason for parents to push their sons to get high paying jobs more than their daughters.  Sons are required by law to support their parents when they can no longer support themselves, daughters have no such requirement.  The parents are looking out for their own interests, which is also a large factor in choosing to have female pregnancies aborted far more often than male.","They're also not super feasible in the social sciences.

Culture isn't a monolithic entity; you cannot assume that everyone is affected by culture in the same way, or even that people in a population are exposed to the same culture. Home life, school life, work life, and personal social life are four distinct cultures a person typically experiences. Which one of these contains your poisonous cause? Which aspect of that sub culture specifically? Is it an aspect of the culture such as influence from media, or peer pressure, or parental input? Why does this aspect induce XYZ effect? Have you answered any of these questions? Have you *asked* any of these questions? Or are you content to simply assume \"culture\" is the problem and move on with your agenda?\n\n&gt;So... Why would men then also evaluate women as less competent?\n\nI don't know, we'll have to test it and find out, instead of jumping to conclusions and assuming we know the answers. \n\n&gt;And is there nothing possibly wrong with a society where women feel so threatened by other women even in lower social status than them? \"This person is a woman, they can compete with me in ten years, so let's go with the safer man?\"\n\nYou're decrying human nature more than you're decrying culture. This kind of phenomenon of human interaction is not isolated to our culture, so it is improper and illogical to assume our culture is the primary cause. \n\n&gt;If you wanna talk scientific, evolutionary psychology is filled with a fair helping of 'just so' storytelling that seems to indicate a LOT more selection pressures acting on us than evidence indicates.\n\nI don't think you understand what evolutionary psychology is if you think it's just a bunch of \"just so\" and hand waving. You're also flagrantly denying scientific principles by assuming a conclusion before any testing has been done (you haven't even spent time considering alternative hypotheses either), so don't think you can lecture me about what is and isn't scientific. \n\n&gt;Except that then fails to explain why the same resume is treated differently, in the same manner, by both men and women, with the bias impacting females.\n\nMaybe because a different hypothesis is needed for why men treat women this way. My first suggestions were about why women might treat other women that way. So let's brainstorm why men would treat women this way (there are plethora of potentially satisfactory hypotheses), instead of immediately assuming a cause. \n\n&gt;Perhaps, but Occam's razor makes me go with the one explanation over the multiple different ones to try to explain the same phenomenon.\n\nYou're using Occams Razor to jump to the conclusion you want to be true, not necessarily the simplest answer. ","&gt;no evidence of discrimination\n\nIt seems like you do not believe that there is discrimination? The first article I linked very clearly showed that people will discriminate against people based *only on their names* (and by that, their gender or race). Is it that much of a stretch to believe that this study can carry on into the real world? Of course it is not discrimination based on policy (that is illegal), but rather discrimination based on unconscious bias. \n\nThe problem exists. It is real.

The idea is to *help others* be aware of their unconscious biases, and how they affect their judgement. Is it really so hard for you to believe that, even if you consciously believe you are egalitarian, you can unconsciously associate negative traits with some group of people, which can cloud your judgments? [Take this test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/research/), and tell me that you don't have any biases. Can you really not believe those biases will lead you to discriminate unfairly? \n\n[This is also an interesting study](http://fortune.com/2014/08/26/performance-review-gender-bias/) if you care to look at it.

In thailand there are plenty of jobs for women but they normally pay very low wages and since women are not expected to contribute significantly financially in relationships many will continue relatively cheap education far longer.

","&gt;Maybe women are just not encouraged to go into that field as much as guys are. \n\nHe actually touched on this. Because of the huge gender imbalance, women are *heavily* encouraged to enter STEM fields. The original poster said this was the case in Norway. I grew up on the west coast of the US, almost half a planet away, and I have the exact same experience. If I saw a poster for a STEM field, it was *always* either gender neutral or specifically encouraging girls. Where I grew up, there was literally zero male-specific encouragement to enter STEM fields, and yet the majority of STEM fields at my local university are overwhelmingly male (with the exception of the biological sciences). These emergent trends in gender-equal societies are strongly supportive of innate gender difference in desired work/interests, and strongly unsupportive of the modern overly-political notion that men and women are perfectly equal in all respects period end of discussion. ","In the US, there are companies that will pay for your college education if you go into their fields. Tech companies often do this with special scholarships that are ONLY for women.\n\nThere are so many \"initiatives\" to encourage women to go into STEM. In some universities there are women only mentoring programs to help women get into STEM. In other places, they simply stop allowing men to join classes if there is too great an imbalance.\n\nBefore they even get to that level of education, girls are encouraged and helped by their teachers far more than boys. They tend to be helped more often and punished less often and less severely. The entire K through 12 educational system is built to support girls, not boys.\n\n\nSo the problem isn't that women aren't encouraged or are somehow discouraged. The problem is that they simply don't want to work in STEM because they don't have to. Women have the privilege to place their own happiness over their income because the government will always step in to help if they need it.","This may prove true in university but in the working world all is equal.

This same thing happens in the West and it's consistently used as an explanation for the Earnings Gap. Women take more time off, especially to have kids, retire early, work fewer hours on average, etc.\n\nSo I don't think it's a specific cultural difference. There's a broader pattern that's just being handled differently in Western societies vs Middle Eastern, Asian, African, etc nations.","&gt; Anecdotally, most of the women from these areas ive met went into engineering or economics because their parents were engineers (both) during the communist era or because they wanted to work in a bank or a financial business, respectively. \n\nThat's been my experience as well; most women I know from that part of the world are intentionally very independent and they work damned hard to have careers of their own.","[removed]","[removed]","[removed]","[removed]","Of course.

In other words, this ranking system is rigged to exclude any measure where men are not doing as well as women.  And that's only if the metric in question is of any interest to women's well-being.  The metrics that are of particular consequence to men are not even considered.  Most if not *all* such ranking systems similarly exclude anything that is of interest to men's well-being:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Inequality_Index https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Empowerment_Measure\n\nI'm not trying to tell you that these ranking systems aren't of interest to women.

We were assigned study groups for the homeworks, and I was with 4 men.

A majority of my overall grades in STEM related courses are in the limits of 94% and 104%. When I was the lone girl, many of my test grades were in the 62% - 70% grade range. I think it was because I experienced an immense amount of anxiety and pressure that caused me to want to get out of the situation the best I could. \nI knew some of the guys in the class, but it seemed like since there was such a large pool of guys that they ignored me and that was difficult. \nI ended up talking to the professor and privately showing that I had the ability, the gender ratio was just terrible.

","&gt;As a father of a teen girl who is great at maths buts doubts herself I'd like to understand this more please?\n\nI'm a math tutor and I have some female students who sound just like your daughter. For teen girls, this confidence issue is tricky because being a teen is hormonal and confusing and you often feel unconfident about everything. However, I believe there are some ways you can help her be more confident in regards to math. \n\nFirst, practice is key. Children need wayyyyyy more practice when it comes to math than they think they do. Secondly, examine the language your daughter uses when talking about math. When she does a problem, does she say \"I think this is the answer...?\" or \"Maybe it's this?\" or \"Sorry, I don't understand.\"\n\nThese kinds of statements are filled with doubt and women in general tend to use these 'softer' sentences that introduce doubt and uncertainty ([especially using sorry](http://time.com/2895799/im-sorry-pantene-shinestrong/)). Try coaxing her into using more decisive language: \"The answer is this\" or \"I don't understand.\" It may seem like a small thing but it will help her fake confidence in math (and hopefully eventually gain confidence) and start to examine how she is phrasing her sentences. Even if it doesn't help her in math, getting her used to using decisive language will benefit her in the future.","Maybe that's because the concept of different spheres of influence for the two genders that existed since the beginning of time didn't really get deconstructed until like 50-60 years ago, and that the results of which, especially in early childhood development where a lot of future interests are determined, are very much still in effect.\n\nThe radical push for true equality for all regardless of gender, creed, or color that defined the later 1900s is a huge leap forward for humanity. However, unfortunately, these are still unsurprising results.","Given that children of different genders tend to go through puberty at different times, my first question is whether or not at a certain age girls tend to be more anxious than boys or vice versa.","That is a good point which hadn't crossed my mind.

It is entirely possible that girls experiencing this anxiety earlier affects their performance in math and science which compounds later when the boys have gotten farther before they encounter that same anxiety.","My mother in law is from Russia and was literally a Russian rocket scientist...

It's been stated since I was a child and the ladies have had it drilled into their heads since birth. Of course they are going to feel anxious about math. \n\nJust because we are now trying to have gender equality, it won't undo the years of conditioning these woman have had, by being told they won't be as good.....

Women may be more easily discouraged if they feel pressure to be \"perfect,\" whereas it is more acceptable (or even encouraged) for men to be rule-breaking Mavericks. This may push women more strongly toward areas where they feel like they can get good grades.\n\nAnecdotally, I've had plenty of male students who were good at math but got low grades because of a lack of effort and didn't seem at all phased. This is significantly less common with female students.","I've heard plenty of stories about talented female engineers having a hard time in tech fields socially, so I know the issue isn't just related to technical performance. That could explain a medium discrepancy I think, but would not explain the massive gap we currently see.\n\nIf you'd like to see the world as a somewhat equal place though, keep in mind things like the Recruitment industry, which is going to stay alive and well even when tech consumes 90% of jobs. Often men in that industry report being the only male among a completely female team of colleagues. The guesstimated conclusions people have come to are that women are simply more effective at socially sensitive communication environments.\n\nI'm not too worried about the big gender gaps if each person *individually* can find an industry they're good at, and has the opportunities to succeed in it. If, however, we can find women who say \"I would love to program webservers, but I feel like I wouldn't be accepted by my peers\", that's where there's still a problem.","I think 40% last time anyone checked","Actually the studies are reproducible.

","[removed]","I have trouble understanding how this can be pretty closely implicated to the male nurses when I would often do better than other people in less-developed nations generally don't have an interest until I got into college.","This strikes at the \"socially constructed\" narrative."," I think that the study should look at more of the  *implicit* forms of gender *in*equality. Even if a developed country touts their efforts for greater gender equality and more women in STEM, the implicit stereotypes (from their family and social circles) that develop essentially once the child is born likely have a massive effect that *may* be more pronounced in developed countries. \n\n\nFor example, my brother and I took the same calculus course in college. I did much better than he did. As a personal social experiment, I asked my mother what she envisioned my brother majoring in, and what she envisioned my ideal major to be. She responded saying that she saw my brother doing well in STEM, and didn't mention anything about me being in STEM despite knowing that I received a higher grade in the course and that I had a greater interest in STEM. When I asked for her reasoning as to why she thought this, she said \"because.\" She did not have any ill intentions, it was a display of the stereotype. Neither of my parents hold a college degree nor do anything STEM related, and I am a white female from the US. I didn't even know what engineering was until college. Granted, this is hugely biased personal example, but the stereotypes become horribly ingrained and hard to beat.\n\n","The 4 girls in my engineering club all have relatives who are engineers. One who got an internship with SpaceX the summer after her freshman year has a dad who is an engineering professor and a mom who was an engineering technician. ","This is the thing I'm talking about! My girlfriends dad, and grandpa are both engineers. All the 8 girls in my engineering class got relatives that are engineers or work in some sort of technical field. I don't think this is a coincidence.","I really really doubt that the \"stereotype effect\" explains the much at all of the difference between men's and women's test scores. \n\nThis would be easy to test: just have a group of boys and girls sit down to take a test, randomly assign each to those told that they are good or bad at the subject, and watch the results roll in. Would those told that they were bad do poorer? Of course. Would those same perform so bad as to constitute inclusion in the weaker group? Almost certainly not. ","It was tested and the stereotype effect does have a large impact on scores. Read the book and it'll change your mind. I thought the effect wasn't a factor in scores until learning more about it and seeing the results. ","Large, okay. But large enough to explain the discrepancies in scores among groups? With gender differences in STEM, I doubt it.","Test example: boys and girls with equal knowlegde are told to take a test. \nHalf are group A, half group B. Group A is told it's a measure of ability. Group B is told it's practice. \n\nThe men in both groups performed the same. The women in Group A performed worse than those in Group B, but the same as men in both groups.\n\nConclusion: When being tested, the pressure of \"girls are worse at math than boys\" is displayed in women's test scores. When women think they aren't being tested, the pressure isn't experienced therefore they do just as well.\n\n\nThere's more detail to it, but that's just the basic outline of the test","But was this difference due to stereotyping commensurate with the difference between sexes? Maybe so, that would be very interesting, but I doubt it.","I think that you are interpreting this completely backwards. \n\nBack in the day, computer programming was seen as \"women's work\" the way that typing and secretarial work was seen as \"women's work\". That was the cultural gender role component. \n\nAs those sorts of gender roles disappeared, women chose to not work in computing. And instead the personal computer led to the geek hobbyist taking over as the \"computer enthusiast\". \n\nSo essentially, it was cultural in the sense that the removal of the gender roles freed people to pursue what they want to. And women, as a general trend, are less likely to be computer geeks. ","Things like biology and anthropology used to be seen as very respectable disciplines. Now that women are the majority in it, is has been devalued by society. You can even see this in things like fashion.\n\nPeople will go to insane lengths to discount the effects of culture.","What planet are you living on where biology isn't a respected discipline?\n\nAnd anthropology is respected. It's just paid less because it's less directly applicable to jobs compared to fields like computing. ","man, there's always a reason why female dominated careers get paid less, and it's never \"because you're a woman\". it's always \"it's less difficult/applicable/useful/profitable/easier to get into/takes less skill\". ","There's more reasons than that.\n\nIt could be more rewarding, allow more personal freedom or flexibility. There is more to life than money and there are plenty of people who would sacrifice income to live a more happy and fulfilling life. ","believe me, i know- i teach. i'm just saying we have frequently rationalized away every reason why women happen to be paid less, regardless of the field. what you're saying is often true, but i also don't think we're far enough away from institutionalized sexism to say the pay gap is 100% due to personal choice and preference.","Well... I mean... University computing departments are basically begging women to join, and big computer companies like Intel and Google are begging women to apply. And they still can't get enough people. \n\nI'm having trouble understanding where you stand on this issue because I feel like you might be using irony or sarcasm on some points that isn't coming through in text...","the issue often isn't hiring, it's retention. to only look at who makes it through the first stages of selection won't provide the whole picture. women used to make up the majority (or close) of CS departments in the early days, and now it's very different. finding out why that is will have a lot of possible answers, but i am confident in saying it's not because women are inherently disinterested in the subject- it could have more to do with the overall experience of being in that field.\n\nwhat i'm ultimately saying: this shit is complicated, and tied up in a lot of intersectional politics. women are choosing career paths that make sense to them, but that doesn't always mean those paths are equitable. the choices we make as people in our careers are often shaped by outside pressures, and those pressures generally aren't equitable as well. sure, women might choose jobs that offer more flexibility in exchange for lower pay, but why do they need more flexibility? could it be due to the pressures and expenses of childcare?","1) if women are motivated by careers then they're crazy not to become computing majors because you can write your ticket as a skilled female programmer right now. You should see how many resources and scholarships and positions there are. \n\n2) women being the majority in the early days was because they viewed computer programming like typing and secretarial work. The idea that 1950s gender roles artificially inflated the number of women working in computing means that a reduction in the number of women computer scientists is a victory for the fight against gender roles. \n\n3) I'm sick of the idea that women wanting increased flexibility is somehow a burden on them. If you want more flexibility then that is a perk that comes with a cost. Because some roles can't afford to offer flexibility, inflexible jobs pay a premium to people who are willing to adhere to inflexible schedules. If anyone wants the privilege of working and spending additional time with children, then that privilege comes at a price. ","&gt; computer programming was seen as \"women's work\"\n\nThis seems very suspect do have a source for that?","A \"computer\" [literally used to mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer) a woman. These arithmetic heavy calculation jobs were dominated by women in the first half of the last century.\n\nYou can see the effect of this initial domination to this day. The majority of statistical programmers, actuaries, accounts and auditors in the US are women. Statisticians, database administrators and financial analysts are at gender parity. In small, niche fields the difference is even more pronounced. I have never in my life met or heard of a _male_ JCL programmer (although this is too narrow of an occupation for there to be hard data).","&gt;  nothing except culture can account for that.\n\nNot really.  One thing is that computers used to be programmed very laboriously with punch cards or teletype machines. This made the task of actually entering in the program very laborious and tedious and that is the role that many women played in \"programming\" those old computers.    Many of them were essentially computer operators, not programmers in the sense we mean it today.\n\nAnother assumption that you're making is that CS has remained the same since the 80s.  In fact, CS departments originally split from Math departments, and have now split further into IT departments and even trade schools code camps.  \n\nSo many people who wouldn't be interested in a 70s style CS program which was essentially much like a math degree, are today interested in things like web development, game programming,  IT administration, etc.\n\nBasically CS blossomed into many different niches which historically has attracted far more males than females.  So it seems more likely that women would have become disinterested in the rapidly evolving nature of CS than that there was some cultural shift that drove them out of CS departments. \n\nI don't know the numbers, but I think you would need to look at just how many of those early \"programmers\" were actually doing programming and not simply clerical work.  It may be that women were never really interested in programming to begin with. \n\n","I think you could look in to a lot of new industries and see similar effects. When you have new industries, they're seen as \"the way of the future\" and it's easy to get rose-colored glasses. So people in general rush in to this new cash cow. After a lot of the hype has died down, and people realize it's not a \"get rich quick\" field, you see them flocking back, and you're left with the people either stuck there, or who genuinely want to be in the industry.","What does any of this have to do with the sudden influx of men and departure of women?","It's my understanding that what you call a few narrow fields are what STEM actually means.  I have never hear of anyone who considers bio, psych, or medicine as STEM fields.","Are you being serious? You've never heard of *anyone* who considers medicine or biology to by scientific disciplines?\n\nSeriously?\n\nSo... Like... Charles Darwin? Not a scientist? \n\nEvolution? Not science?\n\nGenetics? Biochemistry? Molecular biology?\n\nHow about vaccine development? Drug design? Gene editing? Genomics? Are none of these things tech? \n\nI think you need to meet more informed people. These things are definitely science. ","[removed]","This is very true in India. It's very common for high schoolers to aim for engineering and medicine, regardless of their sex.\n\nWomen are also highly respected in society if they are a doctor or an engineer. However, within engineering, most girls go for fields like Computer Science and biotechnology rather than mechanical and civil engineering. Also, in most med schools and biology programs, the girls outnumber the boys easily.\n\nAlso, I have noticed that undergrad girls in engineering play it safe and take up engineering jobs as opposed to a significant population of boys branching out into fields unrelated to tech. Management is an exception because of the well paying careers there.","I wonder to what extent this explains guys picking STEM majors. I know I gave up on my drawing to go into CompSci because of flashbacks of drunks hanging out in front of the convenience store. ","“If anyone makes you feel less than you are, for the color of you skin, for where you come from, for the gender of the person you love, for the religion you have faith in, stand up, speak up, roar. No silence till we are equal.” \n― Thisuri Wanniarachchi, COLOMBO STREETS","I still don't get it. So why aren't women taking STEM courses \"fueled by survival\" like men are?","Ah. Sorry that wasn't clear. \n\nThere's two factors for men: interest and compensation. \n\nSimply put, \"interest\" boils down to the idea that men are more likely to be innately interested in math and engineering type jobs. There's a few illustrations of this. \n\nOne is the aptitude differences among younger children. Apparently it's more common for high-intelligence girls to show general aptitude, excelling in all fields, whereas high-intelligence boys are more likely to show high aptitude in a smaller range like just \"math\" or \"science\". High-intelligence girls have a wider variety of doors open to them and so are more likely to choose a variety of fields. There are more boys who show specialized intelligence and they are more likely to choose to excel in \"STEM\" fields. \n\nAnother illustration is a gender role that got interest \"backwards\". In the early days of computer science, computing jobs were seen as fairly clerical and therefore \"women's work\" much like how the 1950s viewed secretarial work. So back when gender roles were strictly enforced, women did the programming. However, when gender roles relaxed and the personal computer made it a gadget for hobbyists, there was a massive reversal in computer interest and it became much more popular with men. Most people view the overwhelming majority of male computer specialists as a sign of sexism against women, but I think it's the opposite. It's a victory for people being liberated from their gender roles - women no longer shackled to computers and men freed to pursue their love of computers. Despite enormous incentives to enter the world of computing, the women of the present who are free to choose the careers they want seem to have overwhelmingly said \"no\". \n\nThe other major factor is compensation. And since I've spent so long on the first I will be more brief. Generally, women value work-life balance, and men prefer income. There are arduous and dangerous jobs that need to get done, and they pay more because of that, and men flock to these jobs for the added compensation. Why men? There are a lot of reasons, but s big one has to be sexual selection.\n\nThe \"status\" and income of a mate is far more important to women than it is to men. Men generally find women attractive if they are \"attractive\" regardless of ancillary factors. A man's attractiveness is much more likely to be attributed to other factors. I think that most evolutionary psychologists believe there is an evolutionary explanation for this. Dangerous jobs may kill a man, but increase a man's reproductive potential, so his overall evolutionary fitness increases despite the increase in mortality. \n\nThis is why I think it's so offensive when women use \"pay equity\" to pursue equal pay in clearly different jobs... like the university child care workers who sued because they were compensated less than the outdoor maintenance staff despite having equal education requirements. 1 job is outdoors and arduous and the other is sitting inside an air conditioned room. The extra compensation is because the job sucks. \n\nAnyway, I hope that answer makes sense to you. I recognize that it's likely incomplete despite the fact the response is very long.

Growing up (in the southern United States) I have clear memories of adults either laughing when they heard I wanted to go into a STEM field or making demeaning comments about women in STEM.\n\nMy own mother and grandfather would say shit about how females are just inferior and aren't as good at math and science. About how it is inappropriate for women to work in a research or in labs. how women are too emotional to thinking logically. My mom wanted to be a chemist but she let her dad drill these dumb ideas into her head so she dropped her chem degree in college.\n\nMy grandfather and uncles are mostly all in STEM and would shower my brother in attention and instruction when he showed interest in STEM fields but I was completely ignored. Thankfully my father and brother supported my interests.\n\nThis phenomenon wasn't limited to my family.  When I was 13 a friend's mother laughed in my face when I told her I wanted to study biology in college. She thought I was joking because \"that stuff isnt for girls.\"\n\nThere was this brilliant and hardworking little girl who loved science that I was friends with and mentored a little during high school and a bit of college. As she was approaching middle school age, other kids were starting to mocking her for her interest in science. I could see it discourage her sometimes. I have sadly lost contact with her but hope social pressure didn't make her give up. \n\nThis kind of behavior disappeared when I went to college and grad school but it is not a stretch to think other girls experience similarly discouraging experiences before they get to a more accepting environment.","It blows my mind how many guys simply aren't aware of this sexism.","It also blows my mind that someone who always does what everyone else wants or expects of them can still think of themselves as a person and not an object.

There are different types of comments which put women down subtly. Things like comments remarking that there are so many women in Bio instead of the \"harder\" sciences like pure math, physics, or engineering, etc. \n\n&gt; I really can't understand how the idea that 'you suck because of your gender' persists with girls themselves\n\nRegardless of what the media says, the words of the people around you, and in your community matter more. As someone in the minority group, you try to rationalize in your head why exactly so few of people like you are in STEM. Just a few negative comments from people implying it's because of your gender can really push you to thinking *maybe it's because of my gender*. Impostor syndrome is inherently illogical, so thinking of gender as a way to justify your feelings would be reasonable for someone who has been subtly been told that girls are not as good at STEM their whole life (regardless of the fact that they understand that gender does not matter). \n\nIt seems like you disagree with the fact that women have been subtly told we aren't as good as men at STEM.

If there were a male and a female of equal ability who felt equally out of place in their STEM program, the female has one more (large) reason to think she doesn't belong there. Because she is female and girls aren't meant to be in STEM. This is message that's repeated so often and so subtly (and sometimes not-so-subtly) throughout their lives that it becomes part of how they think, and another weight when they're feeling most vulnerable. This *is* society's fault. Whereas a guy can just to think to himself that guys just belong in STEM fields, and it's expected of him to be an engineer or scientist. I'd argue that women have to have a much stronger constitution than the average guy in order to survive in STEM. That's just inherently unfair. \n\nJust as my own anecdote, I've seen my fair share of mediocre male engineers, but almost every female engineer has been extremely competent. This is because they *need* to be that much stronger and hard working to succeed. \n\nIDK, maybe it's easier if you think of it from a POV of a racial minority. FFS, just look at some of the comments on reddit that imply that intelligence has a racial factor, and African people just aren't as intelligent in the ways that make them suited for STEM. Imagine being a black person and reading that kind of thing throughout your life. Is it really any wonder that racial minorities (minus Asian and Indian) are even more under-represented in STEM than women?

They fix their hair, wear make-up, and nice clothes while they're ovulating. This is the most important time to impress a mate, so women go all out. Women find themselves preening in the mirror a lot and giving themselves monthly make-overs. Do I need to get my hair done? What's the best make-up technique? I really wanna do my nails. That type of stuff. There are also physical changes due to high levels of estrogen, which triggers maturation of the egg (ovum) and egg release. This includes better skin, hair texture, and honestly, a tighter vagina (estrogen regulates vaginal tissue growth; the vagina atrophies without estrogen). In addition, the vagina may smell sweeter and more delicious. Sex while ovulating is the best for a woman. They're more confident and horny.

He has surpassed himself in his buffoonery once again, a feat I had hardly dared to believe possible. Until this morning.\n\nFollowing a piffling, tasteless, dry-as-the-Sahara-desert \"breakfast \" , I made my way to the bathroom. I had decided to observe the Mysterious Dripping Creature in the bathtub once again in order to note any sign of weakness that could be exploited in its inevitable capture. Indeed, this tedious past time is my only source of diversion from staring into the dark abyss of tortuous boredom that is my life here.\n\nWhile I was absorbed in my task, I heard the loud, graceless stomping that signifies the arrival of The Male Human. I tried to bolt but he had already entered and was towering over me in his usual, gormless fashion. He was holding The Flashing Apparatus of Shame, hoping to capture me unawares once again. To assert my dominance, I stood upright on my back legs and fixed him with a malevolent stare.\n\n*click!*\n\nAs bold as brass, he had lifted his monstrous machine aloft and stolen my image, to be kept forever inside his Magical Glass World. Oh, but he wasn't satisfied by this alone. No, of course he had to debase me even further, the swine! Upon inspecting his prize, he began to guffaw and called The Female Human to the room, in order to share with her my indignity. Paralyzed by rage, I was forced to endure their taunts. \n\nTogether, they pointed at the triangular section of black fur on my underside. She called it a \"bush\", which I understand to mean the pathetic, flea infested patch of fluff the humans grow over their unmentionables (and which I have not once seen them cleaning in the proper manner with their saliva.) These imbeciles are so ignorant of the noble anatomy of my kind that they do not know the correct location of my genitals.\n\n\n And as though this display of sadism wouldn't suffice, I later witnessed him fastening the picture in the Shiny Warm Box to the amusement of their wretched friends in the cesspool they call \"rideet.\"Oh, the humiliation. The blistering shame of it all.\n\nNow, they sleep. And I lurk here, continuing to plot their demise. Oh, vengeance will be sweet indeed...","That was glorious. ","It pleases me to know that there is someone, somewhere, who is sympathetic to my plight... Perhaps you might even be so kind as to assist me in a... delicate operation?

The everyday water you see contains dissolved minerals and often suspended materials. But, for practical purposes, if you fill a glass from your faucet the water will look colorless to you. The water is in fact not colorless; even pure water is not colorless, but has a slight blue tint to it, best seen when looking through a long column of water. The blueness in water is not caused by the scattering of light, which is responsible for the sky being blue. Rather, water blueness comes from the water molecules absorbing the red end of the spectrum of visible light. To be even more detailed, the absorption of light in water is due to the way the atoms vibrate and absorb different wavelengths of light. The details are beyond the scope of this Web site, but Webexhibits explains this in much more detail.\nhttp://water.usgs.gov/edu/color.html","These reposts are getting smaller and smaller.","Why did this make me laugh so hard","Wow.

Placing the accent mark on the second e stresses the second syllable, making it sound awkward. ","But for anyone who didn't immediately recognize the word, that accent, accurate or not, signaled that 'this is Spanish'.","Perhaps the number one writing skill I learned from English and Literature classes was that concise communication is bad writing.  Whenever possible you should write the same thing multiple times.  Doesn't matter if you could simply state something once in a concise manner, because your audience is too dumb to understand so repetition is the most important thing you can possibly do.\n\nThat is why you must repeat yourself, because the audience is dense and may not get it the first time.  Through the action of repetition, preferably with different words, you may potentially reach your audience in the way they understand best.  Concise communication is wrong, because your audience won't get it.\n\nIn order for your audience to get it, you must reiterate your point through out several paragraphs.  Mixing in supporting evidence is optional, but not recommended, unless you also reiterate that evidence several times, interspersed with tangents, and explained several ways.\n\nIn other words, Imagine you read something once.  Are you going to remember that?  No, because you're a dumb reader.  But if you read it, lets say 50 times, aren't you more likely to remember it?  If you happened to have forgotten f49 of those 50 times you read it, the one time you did remember is absolutely what matters.\n\nSo, to ensure our point is well understood, effective communication involves hammering our point into our audience's heads, until it literally becomes part of their brain.  It's like when your math teacher assigns you 100 math problems, and they're all basically the same math problem.\n\nWhen in doubt, unsure if you should repeat, and uncertain whether repetition should occur, you should always state your point several times.  Failure to do so is unacceptable, as your audience has a short term memory, and is likely to forget, because they don't remember things very long.\n\nBecause of this short-term memory, your audience must read the same thing, time, after time, after time.  However, to ensure your audience doesn't get bored, tired, disinterested, and lacking in motivation each time you repeat your point you must do it slightly different, making a small change here or there, with a subtle reordering of words as to state your point a little differently.\n\nAs a result, your audience, having read your point many times, has a chance of possibly understanding and remembering what you just told them, for we repeat ourselves to ensure that our audience remembers and understands.  Remembering and understanding cannot be achieved through concise information, as conciseness is easily forgotten and lost in the chaos of the surrounding world.\n\nTo give an analogy, imagine a camel.  A 4 legged animal, with a hump, often found in middle-eastern regions.  This animal is known as a camel.  We also have straw, and yes, our camel probably likes to eat the straw, but we have straw.  Our camel, the 4-legged hump-backed animal, is not given the responsibility of carting this straw.  Imagine we load this straw onto the camel, how much can it carry?  In order to determine how much straw it can carry, we must load it onto the camel's back.  As we load the straw onto the camels back, we load once piece of straw at a time.  Each piece is placed on the camels back, since our goal is to see how much straw the camel can carry.  When the camel's back breaks, we know we have finally determined the camel's limit, but being the total of all straw, minus the last piece of straw we placed on the camel.  In other words, this final pieces of straw broke the camel's back.\n\nYour audience's brain is like that camel, and like that camel, they you must restate your point as many times as necessary.  Like the final straw that broke the camel's back the final time you state a point, and the audience understands, you know you have achieved your goals of ensuring the audience understands the point you just stated.\n\nIn conclusion, one must always repeat, reiterate, restate, and communicate their points in several ways slightly differently with subtle tweaks such that your audience understands. This understanding is only achieved through repetition, making concise communication inefficient and ineffective.  If doubtful, always communicate your point several more times, as to ensure understanding.  In other words, state your point in as many times or as many ways as possible, or your audience may not understand or remember.  Like repetitive math homework, it is only through repetition with minor changes that your audience will actually understand the thing it is that you are trying to communicate.","No explicitly stated 3 part thesis, -20","Incomplete sentence,  -10","...And they say *brevity* is the soul of wit.","In context, that line is said by Polonius, who constantly minces his words and is overly verbose, so it's supposed to be an ironic line, hurrying the queen (or ophelia?

This may or may not be true, I'm not American so I can't tell how the climate there is, but atleast I feel that I rarely get the full picture, and I suspect that that may be true for others.","&gt; I read about one incident where it was simply that a teacher had put a trigger warning before a book\n\nHad he not called it a \"trigger warning\" nobody would have reacted I bet. It seems totally normal to me to say \"hey just a small warning there are some uncomfortavle topics, especially a rape scene but this book is very important because of this and that so I need you to read it\". Nobody bats an eye at the \"viewer discretion is advised\" screen either, so whatever. It seems the debate is just poisoned by people who like to get angry at each other.\n\nEdit: And for some reason people who like to get angry are very visible online. Perhaps it has to do with how popularity is measured by web companies, or it is some sort of weakness of human minds","Pretty much this. Trigger Warnings are pretty dang standard in our culture - teachers tend to give them out before discussing works, ratings for games and movies, ect. It's only lately that the term 'trigger warning' came out that reactionaries got up in arms - now that it was a concept with a label they had something they could target :v","Before they were called \"trigger warnings\" they were called \"television content ratings\"\n\nAnd no one bitched about having a little black square in the corner of their TV that said \"M; G V S\"","This a million fucking times. It drives me up the goddamn wall that the same people who bitch incessantly about the existence of trigger warnings are likely adults who grew up with \"content advisory warnings\" in just about every piece of media they consumed. \"Trigger Warnings\" are just the hip, new thing to call \"content advisory warnings\". ","I think the people getting pissy about trigger warnings, are the same kind of people that bitch about wheelchair ramps. It's an accommodation that doesn't benefit them directly, and so they don't see the need for it. It's a very selfish mindset that hears \"Yeah, so I'd just like you to warn me before you talk about rape or any similarly graphic violence\" and responds \"HAH YOU JUST NEED TO GROW A THICKER SKIN, I TOTALLY RIPPED OPEN THE ANUSES OF SOME CUCKS THAT I PLAYED CSGO AGAINST LAST NIGHT\"","Reddit loves trigger warnings when they're called \"NSFW/NSFL tags.\"","Or spoiler warnings.\n\nSomeone with ptsd having their day ruined?

I just read a story today where some P2P pirates are getting put away for 10 years in the UK which is twice as long as some people get put away for manslaughter, which IMO is a much more heinous crime than pirating some movies/music. ","Professor here. \n\nOne of the main reasons the trigger warning/coddled crowd/campus free speech topic seems blown out of proportion on Reddit is that the side that favors free speech outnumbers the sensitive side by 20 to 1 on this site. \n\nOn campus, the numbers aren't so black and white. \n\nBut even if they were, 1 in 20 is one person per class. And it only takes one to complain to the administration to destroy a class. \n\nAdministration is afraid of having a negative light shone on the campus. Therefore, they overreact to a single complaint. So, it trickles down to us. We need to cater to the vocal minority because that's what causes problems, the administration will always punish us for one really loud complaint but rarely reward us for generally positive reviews from the rest of the class. \n\nEdit: this has gotten a lot of attention, way more than I expected when I crankily and bleerily typed this out on my phone this morning.  I'm trying to respond to people, because they feel passionately, and I'd like to continue the dialogue, but make sure you read the rest of the comments to get a more holistic view of a nuanced and difficult situation.","This is my issue with this whole topic. The blame in articles about this always seems to fall on the \"coddled\" students instead of the lazy administration. ","Lazy isn't the word I'd use. \n\nSpineless. Reactionary. Those are better words to describe the administrative problem.","So enabling?","And that's what a trigger warning should be: It shouldn't be (and in the cases I've seen isn't) a filtering and blocking out these things and subjects, it's a warning that something shitty is going to be talked about and if you've been effected by that said shitty thing, it's a chance to brace yourself rather than be hit full force in the face with it - like a PG rating (parental guidance) on movies that, sure, most kids would be fine watching alone, but for others it might be a little too much (or to watch without a parent); or being told that one asshole you hate is going to be at that party you were looking forward to. Your not going to cancel on this party (or I hope it's not bad enough that you do), but you're going to brace yourself and prepare, *just in case* this asshole approaches you.","You know, I have 100% always sided against the coddled kids when it comes to these issues. But it just occurred to me how bad it would be to require a rape victim to read and discuss a novel in which a graphic rape is depicted. There should be an exception in that context. It would almost be like forcing soldiers who had seen their friends blown to bits to watch Saving Private Ryan or something.\n\nOverall I think the more radical college kids today are completely abusing what it means to be a liberal. It doesn't mean shutdown anyone who disagrees with you. It doesn't mean shutdown performances because an artist doesn't think the way you think. I think they're in for a huge wakeup call once they hit their 30s, and a younger generation gets fed up and radicalizes against them in the opposite direction.  \n\nBut were I a professor, there's no way in hell I'd assign a rape victim something like that. Just seems excessively insensitive, having known a woman who was violently raped in Central Park many years ago and how it destroyed her entire identity.","I was actually in this very situation in a class--I am a survivor of childhood sexual abide and one of my college English professors showed a film with a pretty disturbing depiction of that with no warning. Not only did I have to watch it completely shell shocked but I got the joy of listening to my classmates discuss how \"the girl totally wanted it\" afterwards. I'm not going to say it was traumatic but it was a really hard situation to deal with for me. ","Yeah, this is the exact scenario I'm talking about. I'd never allow that to happen in my classroom. It's wrong. Sorry you had to endure it. ","I've always preferred professors giving an alternate assignment option for material that can be personally difficult. It can even be more inconvenient than the original so everyone in the class doesn't go for the alternative. \n\n\nI seen someone mention making them get a note from a psychiatrist, but that seems excessive. If you went years ago and are in a good place, you still might not be comfortable having your experiences become the critique of the class, or be able to contact your therapist from years before.\n\n\nI had an instructor that found out a girl had a baby, and asked her if she considered an abortion and had the class discuss her situation in relation to the story she had just gone over. Another one made her student who had been raped on campus an example in her class for years. Professors don't need to know things about students that they can be shitty with, and even if most won't, there is always one that will.","&gt; But it just occurred to me how bad it would be to require a rape victim to read and discuss a novel in which a graphic rape is depicted. \n\nDing ding ding. It's really upsetting to be abruptly confronted with it. However, with a trigger warning in place, you can kind of prepare mentally for it. Rape is exactly a form of PTSD, and it's very similar to your soldier example, except people don't really think twice about subjecting soldiers to things that would trigger them, yet, people get labeled for asking for trigger warnings for rape sometimes. It's really unfair and costs people nothing to give a head's up about it.","You've nailed what it's about. With trigger warnings, that's all anyone's advocating. They're not even (usually) trying to ban Saving Private Ryan (or equivalent) from syllabi.\n\n&gt;It doesn't mean shutdown anyone who disagrees with you. It doesn't mean shutdown performances because an artist doesn't think the way you think.\n\nThis is a real problem. But I think it's a separate issue. It's more about not wanting to give money or prestige to racists/sexists/whatevers, not about trying to avoid triggering or offending someone.\n\nIt makes sense to a degree. Nobody sane wants or needs a Westboro Baptist Church preacher preaching on campus. But, theoretically, banning Al Pacino for saying something racist in the 80s would be stupid. It's all about finding the right spot on the spectrum, and some people are too extreme about it.","See this is what sucks, triggers does exist for people with trauma. Trigger warnings can be useful. Compassion is always good.\nHowever all these people crying wolf over 'triggers' are making it harder for trauma victims in general. I wish they would put all that energy into supporting real trauma victims and lobbying for better health care, more legal aid, you know stuff that really helps us.\nI say all this as a survivor of abuse.","Also, many others have pointed out that the jokes aren't mean spirited or in bad taste. Like the fact that there's a whole gag about this blind woman, and a big part of the joke is that she's blind and attempting to assemble Ikea furniture.\n\nOn one level, the joke is duh, she's blind and can't see what she's doing. But then there's another joke that's making fun of Ikea stuff for being hard to assemble. So the fact that she's blind makes it even harder, and now we're kind of sympathising with her, which makes us laugh more. But the key is that we're laughing at her situation, not at the fact that she's disabled. And on top of that, she never plays the victim. She can hold her own. \n\nI haven't seen Zoolander 2, so perhaps I shouldn't have commented, but I liked how Deadpool approached its humour for the most part. Indian cabby was a little lazy - good set up but the pay off wasn't quite there.","I also liked that she just plain didn't give a fuck, not just about the jokes, but about things in general.

That same witty, snarky attitude that RR always does.  Fits perfectly here as well.\n\nI'm personally disappointed in them making Deadpool out to be a good guy in the film.  He was a mercenary.   In the film, he is a hero who happens to kill people.  \n\nYou might think I disliked the film,  I like it, it was fun, it was entertaining, but I also don't think it is going to leave a mark on cinema history.  Which is why I don't consider it a movie of the highest caliber that Dtam said.  It lacks the true wit in the writing, the cinematography was nothing special.  When you compare it to a film like Hot Fuzz, there is a complete difference in the depth of scenes in the films.\n\nNot all movies need to be that, nor should the all aim to be.

I'm pretty sure I could ask 100 people who had words decapitalized by their professors and 100% of responses would be from people not killed by it without worrying about selection bias.","I think I may have been a little cranky when I wrote that.  I try my best to make a space where all can contribute.  I actually spoke yesterday to the faculty senate about this very issue, with the idea of promoting a principled middle ground (I don't know how to create one, and was seeking input), but the conversation immediately devolved into 'students should deal with it, we know best,' so I ended up defending the 1 out of 20.  It's difficult to be in the middle, looking for a way to protect both sides.","&gt; like a restaurant saying they should just ignore 1 out of 20 of their customers with a peanut allergy\n\nYou put a sign on the door, and maybe the menu:\n\n\"This product contains peanuts\".\n\nDone.\n\nYou do not scrub peanut products from your menu entirely, if that's what you're into using.\n\nSimilarly, then, it should be simple: put the follow on a syllabus:\n\n\"This class might have information that will hurt your feelers\".\n\nDone.\n\nWhoever doesn't want to take the class because of this needn't, and may live comfortably in their bubble, and the other 19 students can get a proper education where they're exposed to challenging, sometimes-controversial information that will likely better prepare them for the real world.\n","The restaurant can serve food without peanuts to the people with allergies, and serve food with peanuts to people without allergies. They don't need to ban all peanuts from the premises.","No, but they do offer alternatives and warnings to people with the allergies, not just ignoring them.","But you don't know who has an allergy until you're told and the same goes for students in a class room. You don't know which student will be offended or upset or cry or need their safe space until the event actually happens. A professor or anyone really shouldn't have to walk on egg shells for one person. If that person has a problem it is their own duty to bring it up to begin with. ","Is it not common for businesses to be fully aware of the possibility of allergies, even if they don't know which individuals may have them? It's not easy for someone to go up to their teacher and say \"Yeah, i have sensitivity to X\" especially if they've been through a traumatic experience. Now, i'm not saying this go for every situation, because we all know how blow out of proportion that whole \"Trigger\" thing is, but a brief warning goes a long way. Hell, even in grade school, teachers would tell us if we'd see blood in what we were about to watch, just in case someone was squeamish about it. It's just about being courteous is all.","\"If that person has a problem it is their own duty to bring it up to begin with.\"\n\nI totally agree with you, and surely that's the point of the trigger warning; to inform and educate the reader that the work of art they're about to engage with is going to contain this content. We have it for film with film classifications, same with games, I don't see why we shouldn't for books. There have been a few books that have deeply upset and disturbed me because of how they represented/depicted trauma I've had to deal with in my life, but I looked on these as opportunities to grow and emotionally respond. I can totally understand if someone responds differently to these features though, and mental health isn't something to be fucked around with, so I think a trigger warning is a good idea. To use the allergy analogy, yes the consumer should inform the restaurant, but it's also the restaurant's obligation to provide allergy information on products so the person involved can make an informed decision. It's a relationship between consumer, provider and product.\n\nIt's when the trigger warning is abused to try and remove the work of art from the syllabus and say it's not worthy of critical attention that I have a problem with how it can be abused; not the warning itself, but how people misuse it. One person using trigger warnings to crap all over other people's enjoyment of something. It's why I've got no sympathy for people taking their kids to see Deadpool and getting angry when all the sexy swearing takes off. The information is there to inform you and prepare you, and ultimately it's a work of art and how you react and respond to it is unique to you, that's why art/books/music/movies/ are fucking great things to have in our lives. If you don't want to be shocked or challenged by art, fine. Just watch God's Not Dead on repeat for days and days and be happy with that. urgh","&gt; I totally agree with you, and surely that's the point of the trigger warning; to inform and educate the reader that the work of art they're about to engage with is going to contain this content.\n\nSome of us don't burst into an uncontrollable fit of anxiety/rage/tears just because we weren't warned about things. No need to put everyone at a grinding halt so you can throw a fit. \"Trigger warning\" or not, if you're given a syllabus of the materials that are going to be discussed, and you know you're someone who can't handle certain topics, then it's your responsibility to look into these things ahead of time. No professor in the world has time to cater to every specific case of emotional hardship, and it's not their responsibility. If you can't be out in the world without collapsing as person because of concept A or offensive word B being suddenly mentioned without a precursor coddling, then it's also your responsibility to get the professional help you need. Maybe college isn't the best place for you.","What? *Change the menu* to accommodate one person???\n\nYou mean, like, accommodating a student in a class?","If the one student needs accommodations at the expense of the other 19 then don't accommodate the one student.","Does the provision of a trigger warning or something along those lines not accommodate the other 19 though? ","It matters what the one person is asking for.\n\nIf they just want a warning so they can leave the room during certain lectures then that's fine. It doesn't impact anyone else. But if instead they demand that certain topics never get discussed then it does impact people.\n\nThe big issue, as related by the original poster, is that they don't know who the one person is or how reasonably they are, so they avoid certain topics completely out of fear.\n\n [Here](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trouble-teaching-rape-law) is a New Yorker article about how difficult it is to teach rape law now. Some students even asked that none of the exam questions cover rape because it could trigger them. It's such a fucking joke.","Pretty sure at least *some* of those students asked that so that they could study less and still pass.\n\nNever underestimate a college students willingness to lie for a grade.","Wouldn't that imply that we need to take their complaints even less seriously; i.e. be even less accommodating to the minority?","Problem is of course you can never know if they're lying or not, but at the very least it should be yet another good argument that you shouldn't work your curriculum around the minority.\n\nTrigger warnings are fine (though some border on ludicrous where even the word \"rape\" being mentioned is flagged), omitting important parts of the education itself to accommodate the minority is not.","That's not a good precedent for how education should work. Neither is this one person separating themselves from the rest of the group and holding the majority hostage. Everyone does need to be accommodated in some manner but there needs to be a better dialogue on this issue instead of just drawing lines and dividing people down the middle.","It's just that some of these accommodations are completely ludicrous.\n\nExample: http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trouble-teaching-rape-law\n\n&gt;But asking students to challenge each other in discussions of rape law has become so difficult that teachers are starting to give up on the subject. About a dozen new teachers of criminal law at multiple institutions have told me that they are not including rape law in their courses, arguing that it’s not worth the risk of complaints of discomfort by students. Even seasoned teachers of criminal law, at law schools across the country, have confided that they are seriously considering dropping rape law and other topics related to sex and gender violence. Both men and women teachers seem frightened of discussion, because they are afraid of injuring others or being injured themselves. \n\nRape Law is a pretty important topic and its loss in the curriculum will be astounding. ","All 20 people are students. All 20 people must be accommodated. No exceptions. Nobody left behind.\n\nIt's frankly tragic there are so many people willing to sacrifice the minority for the majority in this day and age.\n","It's the difference between these two scenarios:\n\n\"I'm allergic to peanuts, so don't serve me any.\"\n\n\"I'm allergic to peanuts, so don't serve any to anyone.\"\n\nThe first is fine, the second is not. \n\n&gt;It's frankly tragic there are so many people willing to sacrifice the minority for the majority in this day and age.\n\nMeanwhile you are proposing that we sacrifice the majority for the minority. Both are wrong, but I feel that one is a bit more wrong.","Sometimes that 1 student has something valid to add to discussion, which will never be heard if we do not try to accomodate him or her.\n\nNo exceptions is probably too far (I've had to deal with some very disruptive students before, on unrelated topics), but immediately assuming that the minority has nothing to say is a terrible POV.  ","Yeah you've definitely got a good point, different students thrive in different environments and settings, we should be trying to find those if we can to help encourage the best out of people.\n\nBut like you said, you've had disruptive student before, we shouldn't be holding back the majority because a minority is having issues, we should be finding the right setting for them. Maybe even figuring the problem outside of class so they can get back on track in the same class as before.\n\nI expanded on the idea a bit in another comment chain\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4g7033/zoolander_2_is_too_offensive_for_students/d2febb2","It's even more tragic there are people willing to sacrifice the majority for the minority in this day and age.\n\nYou know, cause there's literally more people being sacrificed.\n\nThere's this concept of compromise, you should try it out sometime.","This is the problem with a 'pay for education model'. It's a business, and the administrators are basically a sub-board to the real board members. The only reason this is a problem is it affects profits negatively.","Actually, I'm at a public school that prioritizes access, particularly for poorer students.  Ignore the word 'profits' and you're onto something; we try to cater to every student because service to our community is part of our mission statement.","While I applaud your mission statement, no business runs without profits. The students pay to be taught, you get paid to teach them, and someone who runs the school profits, whether that be the board of directors of a corporation or a state.","Sometimes the best way to help someone is to refuse them service. In an engineering or calculus class, your argument is fine. In a political science or philosophy class, if a student can't even be exposed to a controversial idea without filing a complaint with the administration then they need to not be in that class. You don't alter your astronomy lesson to cater to the one special snowflake in class that refuses to consider the concept of a heliocentric solar system.","All I just heard from you is \"let's fuck 19 people instead of 1\".","Sure, but like you said, you need to serve *all* of your students, if you help one of them at the expense of the other 19, you've failed.","What is \"the expense\" of the others? How are other student's suffering?","If there's a student in a class that has endless needs to be fulfilled, like avoiding inconvenient truths or offensive material, or even if the student learns too fast or too slow, then that can cause \"expenses\"\n\nThere's a reason we have things like Honors classes, Special Ed, Advanced Math, those students have different capabilities and needs then the others, and shouldn't have to be held back or hold back other students.\n\nLikewise in this brave new world, with micro agressions popping up everywhere, maybe we should just have a separate PC class for them, where they don't have to feel offended, but it doesn't force other students to miss out on material.","&gt; If there's a student in a class that has endless needs to be fulfilled, like avoiding inconvenient truths or offensive material, or even if the student learns too fast or too slow, then that can cause \"expenses\"\n\nYes, if we have class rooms full of straw men that will make things difficult.\n","That's not how straw mans work, you asked me how other students would suffer \"expenses\".\n\n&gt;What is \"the expense\" of the others? How are other student's suffering?\n\nWhat I gave you was a hypothetical example, and some ways to deal with that situation.\n\nYou seem to not understand that going out of your way to helping out one student will hurt the others if it's in a group setting.

Zoolander 2 does not have those qualities, so when it tries to pull of similarly edgy jokes it just falls flat at best, or seems insensitive for no reason at worst. \n\nLike comedy can be edgy or a bit distasteful and that's cool.

The vast majority of the protesters were just regular students who just wanted the Dean replaced. \n\nPlease stop circlejerking that these students would've been against Deadpool and offensive jokes, because they never were, and very few people here fit the \"hardcore PC\" mentality.

Zoolander has content that has been nationally rated as suitable for fucking 13 years old. A movie that is suitable for borderline children, is too offensive for 18+ year old adults. Pathetic. \n\n\nP.S. The racist cartoons you were referring to were the social norm at the time. The content was deemed racist decades afterwards. So no. Offensive content has never been purposefully pushed and disguised as media for kids.","Right, but my point is is that something could be rated for children, but since ratings are only made according to the sensibilities of the time, they can miss things that later on in time we might find unsuitable for children or teens. I don't think this particular example is that offensive, but my point still stands for other pieces of media.\n\nThe Disney cartoons are a perfect example. At the time, they were made for children and everyone thought it was totally fine for children to watch them. However, if someone in that time took offense to what was in the cartoons, do you think someone else in that time would be justified in dismissing their feelings merely because it's a children's cartoon?","[removed]","R","I think we are misunderstanding each other. The content of those Disney films did not become fucked up decades after they came out, those kinds of things are unacceptable period. No one thought so at the time, and no one was intentionally trying to be racist, but that is irrelevant because the message is still the same whether it was made on purpose or by merely following the social norms at the time.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because an adult at the time would be rightly offended by those cartoons, even though there would be other people in that time that would think it's suitable for children. Similarly, you are questioning how people can be offended by something intended for children. I am attempting to show you that if you lived in the past, you could make he same argument for racist cartoons. Like I said before, I don't think this movie in particular is that bad, but in general I'm saying that it is possible for society to think nothing of a joke in a film or cartoon but have it still be incredibly offensive to some viewers.","&gt;those kinds of things are unacceptable period.\n\nIn you're deluded opinion. I can understand why Disney or Looney Tunes had racists adult content in the 40s and 50s on; the country was in the midst of major world wars, globalization, industrialization,  let alone major major social changes. You can cry about \"Who's nippin the nips\" bugs bunny commercial, but given the context pearl harbor was just attacked by Japan. \n\nThe *Only* reason you can draw the conclusion that you *may* be offended back then is because you're probably a liberal special snowflake *in current times*. If you were complaining about racism in cartoons after a military attack, you'd be looked at as a pussy, exactly how college kids are looked as pussies today. ","I think we should make a distinction here between an action being understandable given the circumstances and an action being acceptable. For example, like you I understand why those cartoons were made in the past. The world was a very different place and it was in a state of rapid change. Explicit racism was not seen as a bad thing like it is today. So I'm not morally judging the people that made those cartoons. For all intents and purposes, they probably didn't know any better. However, their ignorance doesn't change the fact that racism, sexism, transphobia etc should be eliminated from all levels of our society, including the media we consume. If someone were to complain about those things in cartoons at the time, I think they would be right to do so, even if everyone else thought they were a pussy. Do you not also think it would be right or are you saying something else?","Well, also consider that a lot of rape victims wont just tell people they're rape victims, except to people they really trust. And that people who've been deployed and seen some shit might not want to talk about that. And so I think general trigger warnings might be better than only if you think it might apply to someone. Maybe there's a couple people in a class that were raped (in fact, based on statistics, it's likely that at least one person in a class has been raped), but they haven't told anyone, and the professor believes a trigger warning to be unnecessary.

You're right that this wouldn't have worked in the film as we need to have empathy for the main character and it's a lot more complex than that in the comics.

Why are feminist, anti-racist, and LGBT people demonized for simply expressing their opinions while these primarily white, Christian, conservative schools get a free pass for doing something far worse?","&gt; never have anything to say about places like Bob Jones College or Liberty University\n\nI've seen those bashed for years.

Plenty of people are \"whining\" about both.","Excellent point. It seems like people have forgotten the culture wars of the 20th century, where the right was the side doing the censoring and tone policing. Politically correct, at that time, was not offending conservative sensibilities (\"Won't someone *please* think of the children?!?!\"). We saw artists fighting to keep offensive pieces in galleries, broadcasters struggling against outdated language rules, and movies hobbled by ratings. We still live with a lot of that fallout, but what we are experiencing, today, is what it feels like to live in a more pluralistic society. The conservative form of censorship has been largely retracted to their own communities and campuses, but the internet landed a fatal blow to its effectiveness. \n\nI personally like living in a world where people are able to be open about what offends them. Compared to 20-30 years ago, things are actually a lot less \"PC\". ","And there's a difference between \"this is gross to me and therefore offensive\" and \"this is a minstrel show making fun of me and an entire group of people that I belong to in a tasteless and harmful way\"\n\nHell, most of the time they're not \"censoring\" anyone, that person is just getting the consequences for acting like a bigot.","Unfortunately half of Reddit is pining for those times.\n\nMake America Great Again.

Feminism has won. 40 years ago, the idea that women should be paid the same for equal work, or even that they should \"leave the home and steal a man's job\", was controversial. Now, in principle at least, we all agree that (all else being equal) men and women should be paid the same for the same amount of work. Most Western countries have paid maternity leave and relatively open access to contraception. The idea that woman might become astronauts is no longer outrageous, or even newsworthy. Women can own property, get bank loans without the husband's approval, have no-fault divorces, etc. More and more countries are getting gay marriages, and we're no longer debating the existence of transexuals. This is all a good thing.\n\nI'm not disputing that there is still a gap between the \"in principle\" and \"in practice\" of women's rights, and I'm not denying that there are reactionary forces trying to turn back the clock to 1950 or even 1850, but *in general* the window of what is considered acceptable behaviour and language has shifted virtually all the way to what first and second wave feminists were after. They won.\n\nWhat's not a good thing is the extreme, over-the-top third-wave feminist SJW concepts of \"[micro-aggressions](http://reason.com/blog/2016/04/04/raising-hand-violates-college-safe-space)\", the censoring of intellectual or political debate because it is \"triggering\", and the way the internet is spreading these toxic memes into ordinary, non-university culture. We're becoming more prudish and less tolerant of sexuality in general. In the West, homosexuality has been normalised, but we've become less tolerant of \"deviant\" sexuality like BDSM relationships, which is (again) under assault in places like the UK, and normal human sexual behaviour is routinuely being criminalised, with children as young as nine being placed on sex offender registers for life for \"playing doctors\".\n","In what way has intellectual debate been censored? Can you give any actual examples of this? Are you referring to \"safe spaces?\"\n\nI've not seen anything showing people being less tolerant of \"deviant\" sexuality. If anything, it's cropping up more and more in popular media as a somewhat regular thing. Even then, being less tolerant of someone's fetishes isn't even REMOTELY similar to the actual oppression faced by the LGBT community in the past simply for existing as people.\n\nHave you ever thought it's less \"people are more offended these days\" and more \"I'm not as afraid of being beaten to death should I come out and say that calling someone a tranny is disparaging to an entire group of people, much the same way the n-word is disparaging to black people?\"","&gt; Can you give any actual examples of this?\n\nI do believe that I did. Or at least *attempted* censorship, since the vote to remove Wilson from her position failed. But *eighteen* people (35%, coincidentally 2% more than the highest vote the Nazi Party ever received before dismantling democracy) voted to remove her from her position because she *raised her hand and shook her head*. Repeatedly. The fiend.\n\n(Naturally the real issue was that she raised her hand to *disagree*.)\n\nCensorship isn't just overt banning of speech. It is also the chilling effects that occur when it is dangerous (to your career, reputation, health and in extreme cases even your life) to talk on certain matters or express certain views.\n\nFor example this [disgraceful and frankly despicable incident](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/07/22/sexist_scientist_tim_hunt_the_real_story_127491.html), where a distinguished scientist was hounded by the Twitterazzi and the media because he made *self-disparaging* remarks about how old-fashioned and sexist his generation of scientists were. The mere fact that his speech was universally positive and supporting of female scientists, and the spirited defence of him by a number of women journalists and scientists who heard him speak, was not enough to satisfy the baying of the lynchmob among the media, bloggers and Twitters.","I'm 28, so I remember 20 years ago rather than 30 years ago. \n\nI wasn't saying that no progress has been made on any front, I'm saying that there was just as much censorial political efforts (which I see as a form of PC culture) back then as now, just in a different direction. \n\nI think, also, that there is a distinct difference between people saying \"we should be aware of the impact of of words and the diverse audiences they reach\" and the 90s approach of \"let's defund the NEA if someone paints a Virgin Mary with horse shit\". Of course, people today can go too far, but by and large the public discourse is more open, not less. ","Literally the most reasonable thing ever said on Reddit.","It's also fun to realize people used to be hanged/sawed in half/lit on fire for being blasphemous. Yet it's the end of the world because there are words people might ask you to not say *sometimes.*\n\nPeople are so spoiled today.","Yeah, I have a friend that went to Catholic University in DC. Their Young Democrats (along with other clubs) weren't allowed to have politicians come and speak if they were pro-life. Even if it had absolutely nothing to do with abortion. ","A Catholic university didn't allow pro-life politicians? That's strange.","Whoops","If conservatives were literally burning heretics at the stake, does that make it ok to burn people *you* disagree with? Because it sounds like you're saying that it's OK for liberal groups to enforce censorship just because conservatives do it, too. Isn't it wrong no matter who is doing it?\n\nConsider this: up until pretty recently, liberal groups were *the* defenders of free speech. It makes sense why this would be: defending free speech is standing up for speech that a majority of society does not agree with. For a long time free speech was the *reason* that minority voices, like LGBT people for example, could be heard even though the majority wished they would shut up. *Because* of free speech, LGBT activists were not censored by the offended majority, and therefore were able to sway society in their favor.\n\nSo the problem is that a political group (liberals) who were once very pro-free speech is changing and becoming just as censorship-happy as the conservatives we used to criticize. No one is worried about Bob bloody Jones university because we *know* that censorship is a tool of conservatives, and always has been. Liberals were supposed to be an antidote to humorless censorship. Liberals were supposed to *stand up* for the people society doesn't want to listen to, because society is right about a lot of things (\"child molestation is bad\"), but also wrong about a lot of things (\"surveillance isn't a problem if you have nothing to hide\"). A large portion of the people you see criticizing liberals for being anti-free speech... are themselves liberals criticizing our own \"side\" for abandoning a core value, rather than conservatives trying to score sneaky political points.\n\nMany liberal people today are tempted to say that censorship is only wrong when you're censoring the wrong things; that yes, the wrong things were censored in the past, but now we're more enlightened and we know which things people should be allowed to say and which should rightfully be forbidden. But that's *exactly* what all censors throughout history have believed. Likewise, people with the power to censor will always claim that they're protecting something from merciless assault, and that they need to use their power to censor things *because* they're really so power*less* (note the irony: only those with some form of power have the power to censor).\n\nIt's just human nature to want to silence opinions that offend us. Free speech means fighting that urge. It means realizing that some of the opinions that most people hold today (we don't necessarily know which) will be considered wrong in 50 years; acknowledging that one day good beliefs (say, criticizing a surveillance state) may become unpopular; and having faith that, with free speech, bad beliefs can be weeded out and marginalized simply by making better arguments against them.","Free speech *includes* the right to protest, criticize, or to say you're offended by something. \n\nIf you express an opinion on a controversial topic, then getting a backlash is an inherent part of the experience. If you want to provoke that backlash, go for it. But if you *choose* not to provoke that backlash, that is your decision, not censorship. This is the university *choosing* not to say something.","&gt; Free speech includes the right to protest, criticize, or to say you're offended by something.\n\nThe problem is that those protests and reactions are never just disagreement or discussion; they're often used to completely remove/censor things, and  ruin people's lives by taking away their livelihood. The liberals' version of free speech often goes way past \"I disagree and want my voice heard too\" and into \"I don't like someone's opinion so we have to shut them down\" territory.\n","The 1st Amendment only protects you from government punishment from your opinions, not punishment from your employers or other private groups or individuals. \n\nBy your reasoning, we shouldn't be allowed to complain about disrespectful waiters to their bosses because it might get them fired.","Criticizing something controversial is great. Protesting to change opinions is great. Refusing to attend a lecture or watch a movie that you find offensive is great. That is free speech, absolutely. \n\nBut protesting to *prevent* a speaker (who is not advocating violence) from being allowed to speak, or for a movie you find offensive to *not be shown* is advocating censorship. You are allowed allowed to advocate for preventing other people's free speech, absolutely--that's also free speech. But when institutions *give in* to those demands for preventing speech--that's absolutely censorship. What else would \"censorship\" mean? Censorship by the government (i.e., censorship mandated by law) is just one form that censorship can take.\n\nIn reality, we're always talking about degrees of censorship; not absolutes. We're always choosing where to draw the line. Some people believe that any speech with the potential to upset or offend should be limited; but those people often have very different censorship rules for different groups (think conservative Christians who think making fun of Christianity should be censored, but it's fine to make fun of atheists or Muslims; or people who think lampooning hillbillies is great, but lampooning any black person should be censored). So advocates of free speech believe so it's worth questioning any move to put *more* stuff and *more* places under the censorship umbrella. Especially if you're an institution (like a university) that is not just a collection of social clubs, but is supposed to be responsible for educating people and preparing them for the wider world.","There were no protests. This was the university choosing, on its own, not to show a movie.","Nobody said there were protests. This is what you said:\n&gt; Free speech includes the right to **protest**, criticize, or to say you're offended by something.\n\nBolding mine.","I said that free speech includes the right to protest things. I never said there was a protest at this particular school.","They get a pass because these campuses don't have a diverse population. From students to administrators, it's one homogenous mass of people with the same overarching ideologies (even if they ARE diverse in other respects). They choose to go into these schools knowing the limitations, appreciating them, and embracing them. \n\nAt other schools, there's a wide range of diversity in race, religion, politics, etc.  People get offended because they don't have the same opinions of beliefs.  And then they blog about it. And they protest. And they complain until someone gives them their 15 minutes of fame. \n\nI had some exposure to summer camps that had a Bob Jones type of feel when I was a kid. They tend to handle their issues in-house, but those issues tend to be few and far between because most everyone is in agreement and those who aren't just brush it off (or they say their piece and they're done - they don't tend to push until an entire culture gives them recognition or validation). \n\nThink of it this way...  Conservatives and liberals. \n\nA far right conservative says to a far left liberal, \"we should cut funding to welfare because it's a huge drain on the economy.\"  (This is the only statement made - no qualifying statements or further explanation.)  The liberal goes off the rails saying the conservative is a racist who says blacks are a drain on the economy and he should be punished.  The liberal blogs about it for the next week because it was so offensive to him and all the other people he can think of. \n\nA moderate liberal says to a far left liberal, \"we should cut funding to welfare because it's a huge drain on the economy.\"  (Again, that's the only statement. Nothing more is said.)  Far-Left explains why it's offensive, preaches why it's \"wrong\" to think that way, and then leaves thinking he educated someone. He doesn't run off to his blog or whine about the encounter because \"Moderate might not be thinking properly, but he's still one of us.\"\n\nAnd conservatives do this too. Discussions among *generally* like-minded people tend to be more open because you know the other general beliefs of your counterpart and pull from that to make your argument. These discussions also tend to be more polarizing as well in that they deepen your bond with your belief because you're getting validation from an outside, yet likeminded source. ","Because Bob Jones College or Liberty University doesn't pretend that they're \"pro-free speech\" or promote classically liberal ideas. We all know those \"Universities\" are not \"liberal arts\" universities. Nobody expects them to have an unbiased and rational view of the issues.\n\nThere's also the fact that many of these \"SJW\" college students are limiting free speech and individual rights at PUBLIC Universities. As much as I despise any University that seeks to limit freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, whether public or private, I PARTICULARLY have an issue with a PUBLIC University seeking to limit those rights, which are guaranteed under the Constitution.\n\nBasically, to summarize the reason in simple terms: We all already know that Liberty University and Bob Jones University are shit. We just don't want major, important Universities to follow suit.","Because they don't think that freedom of speech extends to those icky *gays* or *feminazis*.\n\nLiteral Nazis, however, are allowed to say whatever they want.","Because people who complain about SJW's tend to be hypocrites.","Hypocrites complaining about hypocrites. \nUhh, what?

That seems like a fairly extreme example of sexism.","No, she cheated on her boyfriend with 5 game journalists to get her name out there over everybody else including other women.

After that, 4chan users donated a boatload of money to help with the campain. 4chan was less sexist that day than Zoe. Oh goodie. ","\"No, she cheated on her boyfriend with 5 game journalists to get her name out there over everybody else including other women.\"\n\nThere's no evidence of any of that.

","Like gluten allergies ","Not just that, but the loud, hypersensitive people take the focus away from those that really need the help; the ones that aren't staging protests and calling for administrators' heads. They have all the control over the conversation, and chose to make it about themselves instead of those who really need the help and compassion. ","Exactly. As someone that's dealt with a rape victim who was sodomized with a pistol at her head (which really, *really* can fuck up your life - and did to this person) I go on full steam boil when I hear cries of rape from girls who got felt up by a guy they didn't like, or they fucked some guy while they were drunk and had buyer's remorse in the morning. I saw a girl a few months ago get rebuffed by a kid that *she* was groping, he shoved her to the ground and she was shocked and angry and started with the hysterics that she'd been raped and assaulted.. NO ONE was buying it, in fact several people pushed for her to call the cops so we could testify that she was drunk, inappropriate, and groping the young man and it was in fact, HER that was assaulting, in a sexual fashion, the guy.\n\nHer girlfriend was smart and told her no one was feeling sorry for her, they way she acted, and took her home.\n\nMost women today don't have a clue what rape - REAL violent rape with weapon and terror - can do and they claim injury when they're really dealing with trivial discomfort (in comparison) and it makes me thermonuclear mad.","Why would you think that these \"annoyingly hypersensitive people\" as you describe them wouldn't \"genuinely have those problems\"? Are you suggesting that if someone is vocal about things that trigger them that they are not actually affected themselves?","I don't think most are.  Most people who are actually affected just want to keep their head down and get past it.  *These other* clowns are busy being offended on other people's behalf, not caring what it any do to anyone with actual problems, they just have to have some cause to fight for.  It's really about selfish self-importance.","It's a complete and utter strawman you've created to try and prove your point.","Being erroneously offended on others' behalf is definitely a real thing. I think it usually comes from a place of earnestly well-intentioned self-importance, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating for me or self-important of them when a white kid who's never set foot on a reservation tells me \"Indian,\" the term most/all of the \"Native American\" side of my family prefers, is offensive. \n\nI'm still generally on the side of trigger warnings and such, but the fact that we should strive to be polite, compassionate, and aware of different circumstanaces doesn't mean the know-it-all offense-mongering of bourgey white kids isn't real or isn't a real problem. For me, it's not even really a \"crying wolf\" issue so much as an issue of the offense taken on my behalf often being paternalistic and condescending enough to be offensive in its own right. There's a fine line between using a position of social privilege to proliferate oppressed voices which might otherwise go unheard and silencing the oppressed in the name of speaking for them, and the fact that so many self-described activists make basically no effort to be cognizant of that is a real problem. ","Society cant plan around every extreme edge case. My house doesnt have to be wheelchair accessible for disabled folks and my speech doesnt have to be closely guarded for hyper sensitive people. So when extreme edge cases run around demanding that the majority bend over backwards for them they tend to be ignored.","It's like gluten intolerance all over again ","this","All jokes about how politically incorrect Deadpool is aside; Deadpool is a lot less offensive to those with comedic sensibilities or interest in a film's quality.","It bombed financially?

If the movie can't even respect that (plus, I'm not going to talk about the fact that they took B.Cumberbatch (who I really love), a cis-man, to play a transidentity character), then it's normal it gets put out in favor of a non offensive movie.

I played a game at a friend's house once, where someone could flag a card as offensive while playing, and the rest of the group voted on whether to keep or shred the card in question. **That** is a terrible, terrible idea for a creative game like CaH. It means that now every submission a player makes can be scrutinized and censored on the spot.

While it's not mentioned, student programming/activity boards are generally run by students. At my school they were elected, a representative democracy.

But you still come up with the preferences of the majority while this isn't even the issue here. From that point of view Deadpool for Zoolander is probably a very valid decision which I already agreed on. But nowhere did they mention taste-preferences. All the reasons they gave were about hypothetical issues with a minority.\n\n&gt; This is about a college choosing to show a different movie, not a national government strong arming the public.\n\nThe whole concept of anticipatory obidience centers around the public strongarming itself (by means of censoring their own actions and opinions even before a complaint is heard, simply because someone, hypothetically, could complain or be hurt) and has nothing to do with government involvement. Yes, this example is about a college showing a different movie than planned but the issue is about a misguided sense of political correctness which seems to be prevalent in US eduactional facilities. \n\nedit: spelling","&gt;All the reasons they gave were about hypothetical issues with a minority.\n\nYou do realize it's possible for non-minorities to care about and sympathize with issues that effect minority groups right?

And as I said before, it's possible for the programming board to realize that the movie might not fly with the majority of students because of such issues and then decide to change movies.\n\nI do realize that that's possible and it would be a good thing. I just don't believe people would have seen Zoolander 2 and have said \"this is a bad movie because it discriminates against a minority\". If so: well, that too would have been a good thing. But still: the line of thought here (at least as publicly stated) wasn't \"the humor in this movie is something we don't think most people here would like because it marginalizes a minority. for that reason we show another movie\" (a statement which I can get behind), it was: \"it is never okay to show anything that makes fun of a marginalized group\". Which I strongly disagree with. \n\n&gt; Misguided according to who? Reason.com? or you? Have you been to or studied in the US recently? Just because there are multiple articles about SJW's gone wild on the internet doesn't necessarily mean its a prevalent issue. \n\nMisguided in a sense that this kind of thinking patronises the very minorities it seeks to protect. This might just be my opinion but in order to protect a minority or any group you should put into the center of society and treat all its members like people, including good humoured fun-making. You can make jokes about someone without depreciating them, even if it includes the very sexuality which makes them a minority group. So overhearing someone making demeaning remarks about a certain group and standing up to it is a very good thing. Shunning absolutely anything that might (!) be hurtful or offensive simply because it takes up a sensitive topic in a jokingly matter is a problem. While certain movies might touch the subject I don't think Zoolander 2 is what would count as hateful of any minority.\n\nAlso I haven't been to the US lately, hence the \"seems to be prevalent\", but I did have some contact with a few groups of exchange students. This of course is not a representative census but the awareness for this special kind political correctness was a lot higher than in most people I know.\n\nYeah, this is just one instance of a phenomenon that may be more or less prevalent and thankfully nobody in the student's council used the word \"offensive\" (that was only in the rest of the article) but still. It angers me that being very solemn and stern about what one can and can not do and preemptively padding the oh so fragile personalities of unspecified others is the way people go about things.\n\nThat kind of behaviour is disabling to just about everyone and puts some kind of percieved moral imperative in charge.

They might not be the majority, but there is enough of them that they organize online (creating echo chambers for their views), and they attack and harass people for their views.\n\nWe aren't just seeing this with the school systems, we are seeing it in other places as well. Other industries that are afraid of the negative attention and loud noise these groups are making, and are changing things to appease them. You see this in the film industry, games industry, the clothing industry (I have an example of one recently in my other post above) and practically any market where they can go after someone for supposedly offending them.\n\nAgain, the issue is that these extremist groups use the fact that they are pushing for progressivism - to justify their behavior and strong arm people. They might be completely in the wrong - but if they are screaming their heads off that a company is being racist or sexist, companies don't want to deal with that and back down.\n\nWe can all agree racism/sexism and oppression is bad. But that doesn't mean someone \"fighting\" for those causes, are automatically right. That the things they say are racist/sexist are actually those things or is offensive. But they use the fact that they are just fighting for progressivism to blanket justify their behavior. And when they go after someone, saying something is racist/sexist - scares the people that are being harassed by them. They don't want those accusations to stick, or for the media to run stories on it. And sadly, the media often enables them. Other progressives enable them (I'm a liberal progressive, and I strongly disagree with what these people are doing). But I see progressives that worry that if they go against these groups who share their ideology, they will be seen as fake progressives that don't actually want to take down racism/sexism. \n\nThis was actually one of the things that turned me away from Feminism when I was in the University system. Being a woman, it felt completely empowering to be around other women who were strong and confident. And it felt good to push for issues that my gender faced. But I quickly started to see this mentality that what the leaders told us was sexist -- was supposedly 100% sexist. You couldn't debate it. And if you argued against it, you were seen as not a real feminist, or someone that enabled sexism/misogyny. This ultimately caused me to leave, because I don't believe we can point to every single thing and say: this is 100% sexist/racist. Not all women agree on things that are offensive or sexist. Hell, not even all feminists agree on all the issues (which is why it's such a splintered group full of sub-groups and infighting). But that's the thing, I don't think we have to 100% agree all the time. I think we should have debates/discussions. If you find something offensive, let people know why, and then be open to hearing what they think about it.\n\nBut that's not how I found these groups to operate. When they found something offensive, it was 100% offensive. And they were going to tell people that if you don't find it offensive, you are sexist. You are the enemy. They aren't interested in having a discussion, they want to beat people over the head and force them to share their views. I eventually went to work for the film and game industry (I did internships and eventually scored full time jobs). But I noticed the same thing was happening in the games industry. Almost all the games media would have writers that would write pieces that said: this is sexist, if you don't agree, you are a sexist. And this kind of stuff was constant. These activist/writers were beating people over the head and saying things were 100% factually wrong, and that if you like it, there is something wrong with you. And this caused a lot of resentment between consumers/readers, and the media. \n\nI'm all for people using their voice to be critical, and voice how they feel. But just because you are offended, doesn't mean others are offended. Just because you don't want to see content that offends you, doesn't mean you have the right to take that content away from others. And that is basically what you are seeing at the Universities, where these groups want to take away classes from others (because it's not good enough to protest and be critical, or to just not take the classes. They need to take that away from others).\n\nWhat is really odd is, back in the 90s there was a huge push by extremist religious groups, to censor and take away content they found offensive. Why? Because these groups believed that the content they found offensive, turned their children into serial killers and rapists. We all laughed this off. But I'm now seeing THE SAME mentality from these leftist/Marxist/feminist -- who argue that offensive content, turns men into misogynists/rapists and makes them sexist towards women. What was once laughed at, is now being taken seriously (because it's progressive groups trying to stop sexism). It's really kind of wild. \n\n**TLDR;** extremist minority groups use the fact that they are progressives fighting for progressive issues, to justify their terrible behavior.  They will make loud noise and accuse people of being sexist/racist, and then these Universities/companies being accused get nervous and don't want these accusations to stick (or the media to pick up on it). So they fold and appease these groups, so they stop making noise (thus, extremist minority groups are strong arming people which is impacting everyone else). Liberals/progressives and the media are enabling these groups by not calling them out. These companies that give in and fold to them, are also enabling by not standing up to them. These extremist groups are basically hiding behind progressivism. \n","Well said.","tl;dr","He's explaining how he thinks that Hamlet is mad with love for Ophelia to both the king and the queen.","That's the one ","Comic sensibility...

The issue isn't that there is quickly becoming a majority of coddled people that want to stifle free speech (or speech that offends them or isn't progressive). They are very much a minority group (although I see it growing with some scary trends on the Left). The issue is that companies/universities - listen to these people when they freak out and scream their heads off.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of companies backing down or changing things to appease these minority groups. And I don't get it. But the real issue is people bowing down to these minority groups as soon as they complain.\n\nI kid you not, Target had a joke shirt during Christmas that was a play on anxiety and the Christmas season. And a group of people said it was offensive to anyone that has legit anxiety, and Target quickly pulled the shirts off the shelves. Despite organizations that were about anxiety saying it was funny and they didn't know why others were saying it was offensive.\n\nThe thing about free speech, is that everything is always going to offend someone. No one has the right to decide what is offensive, because not everyone agrees. We've made exceptions for speech that can cause riots, or physical harm to others - but those are very specific. Now there is a movement on the Left that thinks it's the Gov responsibility to protect them from everything. That they have a right to not be offended.\n\nAnd you are seeing this movements on the college campuses, where they will protest and get classes shut down because the subject offends them (even if it doesn't offend others). And in some of these cases - the university listens.\n\nBest I can guess, is that companies want to avoid bad publicity. So even if it's a minority group protesting them, they don't want it getting out of hand and it becoming a stain on the reputation of their company. But then this creates an environment where these minority groups know they can gather a couple thousand people, and scream their heads off and people will fold. \n\nSo no, universities are not being overrun by these coddled/Marxist. But the universities are afraid of any bad attention and are quickly folding to them. The scary thing about this movement is that they use \"progressivism\" to justify their behavior. They fight against sexism,racism and minority oppression. All causes worthy of fighting for. But they use that as a blanket justification for their behavior. And believe that because they are fighting for progressivism -- their views must be right. And sadly, I see other progressives go along with these people, or don't call them out. Almost as if they are afraid they won't seem progressive enough if they take on extremist progressive groups. ","We call this bi-polar.

The offended students could have just as easily decided not to watch the movie if they found it distasteful instead of trying to get rid of it outright. While this is just about a movie it's the principle that counts and their actions were wrong on that principle.

Not to mention, several of those white \"leaders\" exclude any other white person from the discussion unless they meet the status quo.\n\nThe thing with modern movements is that it _needs_ to include white people too because, despite the fact that many of those in power are white, the _overwhelming_ majority of white people belong to the working class.

I agree with you on your other points though.","Okay, and here's a list of actual science on the topic.\n\nhttp://ask.metafilter.com/280405/Psychological-studies-on-trigger-warnings\n\nBut I'm sure you and a clickbait piece designed to win the hearts of grumpy neo-cons everywhere are right, not the people who actually study these things.","Calling people who disagree with you \"grumpy neo-cons\" is not a great argumenting strategy.","he didn't. he said that the article panders to those people.","Let's deconstruct.  \"not the people who actually study these things\" is the line.

Restoring a feeling of control is thought to help improve victims’ psychological health (Janoff-Bulman &amp; Frieze, 1983).\n\nNot taking sides in this argument but the authors of that newsletter had to dig really deep to find something to support their thesis. A 33 year old study for a psychological or sociological thesis wouldn't hold much weight for other discussions because of how quickly said fields evolve.\n\nBut maybe I'm just being a \"grumpy neo-con.\"","Ah, yes. The \"actual science\" conveniently supports what you say. ","Yes, but take a look at it pragmatically. What triggers do you acknowledge and which ones do you not? Do you only acknowledge certain triggers? It's completely recursive. Eventually, and there are, people get triggered by triggers. So who puts a trigger warning on the trigger warning?\n\nIt's a decent, humane idea but it is a terrible theory and even  worse practice. It's like defining \"sick\". Eventually we are going to need \"doctors\" to diagnose what triggers are real and then write those warnings so only official triggers are taken seriously. It would be the DSM for triggers. \n\nIt's recursive as fuck and has no pragmatic purpose. ","Ate you kidding me with this? Triggers are a psychological concept that refers specifically to trauma. If you want to be part of the conversation at least get a basic understanding of the debate, rather than just making up arbitrary definitions to attack.","You didn't address any part of his argument. He didn't even give a definition of trigger, so it makes no sense that you attack him for \"making up arbitrary definitions\". You just attacked him personally. What a shitpost. ","But people are abusing the point of a trigger warning. When something exists that would necessitate a trigger warning, there are those who are using it as an excuse to try and take away the choices of others, instead of using the warning to inform their own individual choices. THAT'S the issue people have with it. ","You are in a fucking university. There is no choice. You learn and do what you are required to learn and do or get the fuck out. Nobody cares about your feelings. ","The point is that trigger warnings tell people whether or not they should get the fuck out if they need to. \n\nIf someone with a trigger is given a reading they have to do, but are warned there's a trigger in their reading, they can say, \"Oh, well I guess I should get the fuck out/take another class/mentally prepare myself for this.\"\n\nAnd it's not just about feelings. Granted, for some people who cry wolf, it is, but there are also people with legitimate psychological triggers for whom this is a bigger deal than just their feelings, it's about their psychological health.","It's an interesting question though, don't you think? Does the introduction of trigger warnings make some people who would otherwise not be affected become affected? I.e. before trigger warnings those very same people might just shiver, then get over it. Whereas now, they are encouraged to take feelings of mild discomfort and amplify them. Note - I'm not talking about those with bigger issues here, just wondering if the introduction of trigger warnings has led people to have a finer sensitivity to problems, and focus on their sensitivity rather than their ability to cope.\n\nAs one example, take the sort of psychological games people can play. It's easy for someone with the right mentality to learn that playing a victim gets them a benefit in life. If they're rewarded for this often enough, they might end up making it a habit.\n\nAgain - I'm not talking about the population of people who would have a problem before trigger warnings. I know some people have problems. I'm just wondering if the introduction of trigger warnings has multiplied that population.\n\n\n\n","There's definitely gotta be people who make them up or claim they need warnings even if they'd just end up feeling mildly uncomfortable without them, and those people probably are encouraged by others taking them seriously. But there are always people who take advantage of people's good intentions for help/attention, it's not exclusive to triggers.\n\nThe question I think that's more important is whether or not more people claiming to have triggers is beneficial or harmful to people with actual triggers. Does it mean they'll be taken less seriously, or will more trigger warnings help them? Or is it some wash of consequences? \n\nI would hope it's analogous to people excessively wanting gluten free food despite not being affected by gluten. It's mildly annoying, but it helps people with actual reactions to gluten, so it works out. I'd say it's worth encouraging mildly annoying behavior in some if it helps the health of others.","Short answer: no.\n\nI have complex PTSD from abuse, and if I'm not made aware that something I'm reading has graphic descriptions of sexual abuse, I can be triggered, which in my case can lead to nightmares, insomnia, and flashbacks, and possibly a panic attack. That can fuck me up for days. With a trigger or content warning (which is pretty much like those TV and movie ratings), I can mentally prepare myself if I choose to go forward so the chances of those things happening is a lot less and whatever does happen is generally milder.\n\nAs for \"getting over\" being triggered: it is possible, but that must be done in a safe environment with a knowledgeable and trusted professional. Not warning someone about triggering content and expecting them to just \"deal with it\" can make it even worse.","Or you could be an empathetic professional and have consideration for those who have been through traumatic experiences. Just a thought.","FOUND THE SJWW@!1111","But they often don't. It's classic \"give the devil an inch.\" It starts with trigger warnings, but by the end of it you have people running to their safe space after being traumatized by sidewalk chalk.","You could also just choose to participate without a trigger warning, like everyone else or regular people with a modicum of mental fortitude surrounding topics they dislike. No need to play up your sensibilities as PTSD.","That's on you for assuming it's \"playing up sensibilities\". From the comment chain, it should be clear we're talking about serious things such as sexual assault/rape, where people may have had traumatic experiences, and something as prolonged as a discussion on the topic could be very difficult for them.","&gt;That's on you for assuming it's \"playing up sensibilities\". From the comment chain, it should be clear we're talking about serious things such as sexual assault/rape, where people may have had traumatic experiences, and something as prolonged as a discussion on the topic could be very difficult for them.\n\nWe shouldn't cater to those people's sensibilities, especially considering that such sensibilities are highly politicized and used on the part of victims to control discussions. Your sense of empathy regarding victims is overwrought and unnecessary. \n\nIt's best that victims and people who would otherwise be incapable of participating in a discussion see to their own needs and not impose them on others.\n\nCheck out the recent Atlantic article on the subject of \"concept creep.\" It describes the problem of catering to victims pretty well.","But you've just made an argument FOR trigger warnings. A trigger warning, by definition, isn't stopping any discussion. Its not censoring any content. ALL its doing is giving people a heads up in case they want to duck out of that particular discussion, which, as you say, would be understandable. ","I'm not sure if you are naive about the subject matter or just unaware of [how it is used](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/). People's objections to trigger warnings is not the free use of a heads up by a prof. That not how they are they are being used. It is very much being used as a censoring device, being demanded by students, the lack of them being used as a basis of complaint against professors, and the need for them at all being used a an argument that material should be dropped from a curriculum, including the teaching of rape law from law degrees.\n\nFurthermore, while they *might* be argued for people with PTSD or other *professionally* diagnosed conditions, they are being used in the context of students being *upset* or *offended* by material and thereby avoiding being upset or offended by avoiding the material. That is, they are self-protecting their existing belief systems instead of being exposed to different points of view. This is the exact opposite of the purpose of post-secondary education and significantly diminishes the value of that education to the students or society society society whole. It also serves to polarize the society by keeping the topics, points of view, and reasoning from being discussed and just turn into \"us vs them\" in-group/out-group divisive mentalities.\n\nOn top of that is that this reduces our abilities to sympathize or empathize with others. This may seem counter-intuitive, as trigger warnings are usually promoted as a way to be compassionate to those who may be offended or upset, but by reducing people\"s exposure to differing points of view then one cannot *understand* those points of view, and therefore can neither sympathize (understand their pain) or empathize (feel their pain). \n\nFurthermore, the trigger warnings teach the students, both those supposedly triggered and those not, that the subject matter is problematic to discuss in the first place, instead of investigation and discussion of it to be healthy and educational. The reduction in discussion it has harms the students who are not triggered at all.\n\nOn top of that, the scientific evidence from psychology is that trigger warnings are exactly the wrong thing to do for people that have PTSD, phobias, or other psychological issues. Easing into subject matters and dealing with them is actually the right approach and *good* for people with those conditions. \n\nReally, there is nobody who ultimately benefits from the concept, either as naively described as you have, or as used in practice. It's just a very bad idea completely.\n","I've read that article, i didn't really like it at the time. Its been a while so let me see if i can still articulate my thoughts correctly.\n\nTo take the example of the back and forth of micro-aggression, sure it gets taken to extremes, and of course theres always someone willing to write an article about how the world is ending because someone called them out on an insensitive statement. But when people bemoan this, the implication always seems to be that the other party just shut up and internalize it like they've always had to. That just as fucked up a solution, probably more so.\n\nSimilarly with trigger warnings and similar concepts. Personally, from what ive seen they can be helpful in certain situations (i find the evidence that there counter-productive from the Atlantic article underwhelming; last i did any reading on this there seemed to be two camps neither with any really clear evidence) but ill also grant  that there absolutely being overused and that people get far to militant about policing that kind of content. Especially when the line between discussing/representing offense content and actually being offensive gets blurred, that should be alarming to anyone.\n\nWhat I see in all the cases is people, particularly students, struggling to find a new balance of how far to apply these concepts and how best to create a universally inclusive experience. That's an admirable goal and my biggest problem with these arguments is the undertone of \"we should just go back to the way it was.\" The way it was sucked really bad. \n\nWhat seems to be lacking is proper mediation of this process, and that's on the professors and the universities. The bigger problem behind this always seems to be administrations being unwilling to back their professors, so that the professors in turn don't feel they can properly teach and guide there students. The background always seems to be the over-commercialized colleges and universities unwilling to draw any lines or back their professors to actually teach.","Can you give me the list of things that need trigger warnings? I'm going to need the complete list so everyone is covered. Don't skip anything. ","The thing is most teachers provide a syllabus that details what will be discussed in each class. If you do that then you don't have to worry about having a complete list of triggers because the major topics of the class period are already available.","There are thousands of triggers that a two page syllabus can't cover. Do those people not matter to you because they weren't sexually assaulted?","&gt; But I don't get a special filter on the world where people can't talk about these topics.\n\nNeither does anyone the people above you were talking about.\n\n&gt;a trigger warning before a book to let students know that it involves rape and they are free to to react to it the way they want, but if they want their grades they need to read the books\n\n\"Hey, be forewarned, this will come up\" is not at all the same as \"we aren't allowed to talk about this and you can ignore it.\"","The thing is, trigger warnings can cause a trigger which wouldn't have come otherwise. It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy. \n\nI saw some psychologist with experience with PTSD victims talk about this, and he said it's a bad way of going about doing things in the real world.\n\nBut what do I know. If victims are the ones to push the pro-trigger button, they can have their thing. But if it's people whom have no triggers, but are merely taking offense on others behalf then there is some room for investigation.","&gt;They can not participate, and that would be understandable\n\nIsn't that the point of a trigger warning? To let them know about potentially *triggering* content so they can choose to consume it or not? It's honestly a useful tool, especially for military veterans suffering from PTSD, but many people have been turned against it by memes showing the most ludicrous applications of the idea. I saw an excellent post about this phenomenon in [r/Changemyview](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview): essentially we have to remember that the internet highlights the most extreme incarnations of ideologies, modems and concepts, and those don't always reflect the general real world. I could go on about this topic but yea, trigger warnings aren't the devil.","I never said they would. The overall topic of this thread is about censorship (movie not being shown). SO I think that there are really poor decisions made on college campuses (story about Native Americans being pulled by brown administration because few found it offensive), and I think often times people combine all of these experiences, on both sides of the argument, and view the other person or side as almost a caricature. \n\nFor example, the poster asked why people give rape victims vitriol. Is this a fair assessment of people who think society has become to offended? I don't think many so. Clearly some do give a hard time to victims, but most people absolutely do not.\n\n And I have been assumed to have been against trigger warnings, I am really not. Though, I do admit I loathe the phrase \"trigger warning\". Back when I was in university, they would simply say \"we're going to show you X,Y,Z and it contains things that may be disturbing\"\n\nLook, I think if we didn't see schools censoring discussions or bending over backwards to protect students from the harsh topics of the world, we wouldn't even be having this discussion. But many have done so, and so people might be overly sensitive to it, and possibly argue against a reasonable level of sensitivity regarding rape victims. And going the other way, people involved in rape victimization activities may also be a bit too sensitive about proactively trying to censor discussions.","But my point is that these stories you hear of are exceptions not the rule. Go to a regular college and you are unlikely to experience any of the extreme \"coddling\" you hear about. You see these stories and think that is an epidemic, when it's not in reality. This also leads to, like you alluded to, over sensitivity to stories like this one: is this really \"censorship\", especially considering they showed Deadpool instead? Are they then \"censuring\" every other movie that they don't show? It's not like the movie is banned on campus or anything.\n\nAs an aside, I had to look up that Brown university incident you mentioned. It seems that a pretty clearly racist, and apparently poorly written, op-ed was published claiming that native Americans should be thankful for colonization. Not sure that that constitutes \"censorship\" either, it's not like it was a news story, it was a shitty opinion piece.\n","People absolutely do treat sexual assault victims poorly in this context. We're also talking about warnings before seeing/reading depictions of rape, not filtering all discussion on the topic. That would be silly.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, those of us that support the idea of trigger warnings definitely also want the same for depictions of suicide and car accidents. Sorry for your loss.","\"No one should strive to be so fragile.\" From the article. ","Wanting a heads up before having reminders of my sexual assault thrown in my face so I can avoid it if necessary is not 'striving to be fragile', it's striving to avoid unnecessary additional pain (i.e. a perfectly logical human response to a shitty experience). \n\nI'm not demanding the world censor itself on my behalf, just asking for a goddamn warning so I don't have to feel phantom hands on me while I'm just trying to learn shit in class.","Ok. Fair enough. I can't find one anywhere so can you give me a complete list of all triggers so I can be socially conscious in the future. Don't want to miss anyone so it needs to be the full list. ","Not sure if sarcasm but... there is no master list and it doesn't really apply to individuals unless you are in a position where you present things with potentially sensitive topics to people, like a teacher or tv producer. And obviously there's always going to be *someone* with a weird phobia or experience no one would think to warn for, which is forgivable. \n\nImo, the things that should require trigger warnings are depictions of: death, gore, assault, suicide, car accidents (separate from death because it doesn't need to look fatal for someone who survived one to panic from the sound), war, and sudden loud noises/flashing lights in video. \n\nCommon sense stuff to me. We already have some of these for certain things, like tv shows with mature ratings start by saying \"this is rated for graphic violence and sex\" or whatever. It takes 10 seconds to say \"this video/story/recording contains x sensitive topic\". Which is a much lesser inconvenience than having to potentially deal with someone having a flashback or panic attack.","What about pit bull trigger warnings? A grandmother in my town watched her grandchildren get mauled to death and was brutally attacked herself. Are her feelings not as important as a sexual assault victim? Why do you use the term \"weird\" to describe other people's traumatic experience? Would sexual assault be considered weird?","&gt; What about pit bull trigger warnings?\n\nThat would fall under the gore and/or death warning in my list. In a perfect system with these warnings, I would hope some context would be included to maximize effectiveness of the warning. A warning for pitbulls in general is where we start getting into tricky gray areas of this topic.\n\n&gt; Are her feelings not as important?\n\nOf course they're just as important, I never meant to imply that any traumas were somehow lesser than others.\n\n&gt; Why do you use the term \"weird\"?\n\nI used it while making the point that it's impossible to predict what seemingly innocuous thing can trigger someone. For example: it would seem objectively weird to panic at the sight of say, a pink bear. But if you were attacked by someone wearing a pink bear costume then it makes sense. It's uncommon triggers that I'm calling weird, not the associated trauma itself. \n\nJust making a point that I don't think we need to warn for things like pink bears on the tiny chance someone has that unique trigger, and it would be silly to expect anyone to. The more general ones I listed aren't nearly as unique, so it makes a lot more sense to cover those.\n\nNot sure why you think that extends to me finding all sexual assault weird. If the boy who assaulted me had been wearing a pink bear costume at the time I'd still think it was an objectively weird trigger to have.","You just said it perfectly. \"I used it while making the point that it's impossible to predict what seemingly innocuous thing can trigger someone.\"\nThis is why trigger warnings are a terrible concept. If a person is sensitive about something and don't want to hear, read or see certain things it should be on them to look into whatever activities, books, classes, movies, tv shows, etc... that they are interested in and avoid those that they may not like. \nIf you say it's everyone in the worlds responsibility to warn everyone else ahead of time that they may get upset over material that 99.999% doesn't get offended by you can't just limit that to your view about sexual assault, gore, violence and whatever else you listed. The vast majority of things are \"seemingly innocuous\" to most people. Your experience with that boy should bring the world to a grinding stop and nobody else's traumatic experience should either. There is a very high number of ex military that have PTSD. Should the world put out trigger warnings for every popping sound like popcorn at the movie theater? Maybe ban fireworks and bubble wrap or put a big warning label on them?\nWhen is it the individuals responsibility to do a little research to avoid possible triggers? If you put out trigger warnings for one issue you should really do it for all of them otherwise you are downplaying the traumas other people have had and saying that they are their experience are way less important than yours. This is extremely selfish. ","They aren't asking for it to be filtered - they're asking for a heads up before they go into it.\n\nCompletely different.","Saying \"maybe we should care about other people's feelings sometimes\" isn't censorship.","That is one possible scenario, yes.

I am frankly a bit confused how this is even up for debate. \n\nYou can argue that it isn't a major form of censorship, and I would kind of agree with you. But the climate on college campuses has changed, and I think it can be an issue. But whether it is or isn't censorship isn't up for debate. ","don't what? it sounds a lot like \"well if I'm getting fucked so should everyone else\"","Because the issue is bigger than you're making it out to be and extends well beyond people who have suffered from types of violence asking for sensitivity to those that broaden and expand definitions to those that want to glom onto any tragedy that they can stick their necks on.

Which would be ok. But it is NOT ok to ask a forum to censor the movie or not show it simply because I may find it offensive. ","This is the fundamental break on the political left these days, between liberals who want opportunity for individuals to freely explore and express themselves, and the regressive left who, like old-school conservatives, want to censor the world to behave within predefined acceptable boundaries set by some establishment so as not to be offensive to certain groups. The only difference is which groups are the ones respected or not. Old-school conservatives put Christian and nationalist institutions at the top of the hierarchy that should not be offended (clothing, insulting Christianity, burning flags), and the regressive left simply inverts this such that minorities, non-dominant cultures, and marginalized shouldn't be offended. \n\nLiberals (left) and libertarians (right) generally don't care that somebody is offended. \"I'm offended\" is too easily abused to control anything and everything, and there is no basis in psychology, philosophy, or ethics to warrant such policies.","Why do people like you love to use that c-word?

How many times have you heard of a student claiming their grandma just died so they can avoid an exam the day after?\n\nIt's harsh, it's tough, but it's the world. If you can't handle it get out of the way and return to face it when you can, don't act like there's no problem with you not doing necessary homework and assignments.","I have PTSD. I hate the word 'trigger' because our generation abuses the shit out of it. There's no special treatment where I can just stop my day-to-day because I'm having flashbacks and borderline panic attacks. ","Yeah, they've been through hard times, no need to look down on them and act like they're overreacting.\n\nStephen Fry said a while ago that people have to stop feeling sorry for themselves, I don't completely agree with what he says, but I also don't entirely disagree either. I'm transgender, and a while ago I had to tell a transgender woman that she needed to stop feeling sorry for herself *because that was the only thing she was doing*. She was so depressed about her life and didn't have anything to make her feel happy. Every second was about how miserable she was and that's not healthy. Maybe that's what Stephen was *trying* to say, that it's not healthy to get too lost in your own misery.\n\nOfcourse, she needed help and that's what I was trying to do. I didn't just say \"Oh, cheer up! Lets have a beer and watch Doctor Who!\". That wouldn't have worked. Self pity *can* be very destructive, but to litteraly say \"Stop feeling sorry for yourself\" is not helping.","Fry fucked up in how flippant he was in what he said but he wasn't wrong in the main thrust of it. The sneering way he spoke about uncle touching in the bad place was bullshit and dismissive to all sorts of people.","I think that's a good way to sum up how I feel about it.","&gt; a while ago I had to tell a transgender woman that she needed to stop feeling sorry for herself *because that was the only thing she was doing*. She was so depressed about her life and didn't have anything to make her feel happy. Every second was about how miserable she was and that's not healthy. \n\nYou know not to be an armchair mental health professional...but you're right about one thing: that really doesn't sound healthy. It sounds like depression, which is a clinically diagnosable malady, not simply someone, \"Feeling sorry for themselves\". Telling someone in that situation to, \"Just stop feeling sorry for yourself,\" is about as kind and constructive as kicking them in the shins.\n","Some people claim to be triggered by clapping or other absurd things, so that's the kind of thing people make fun of. No one is making fun of rape, this is just strawman. ","I'd argue that it's the \"triggered by clapping\" that's a strawman. Most trigger warnings are for genuinely traumatic things like rape or violence.","Not necessarily, PTSD can be triggered by pretty random things. A soldier, for example, could be triggered by unexpected clapping, fireworks, etc. \n\nMy understanding of triggers is admittedly limited, but I believe it's something that induces an uncontrollable physical reaction, likely due to PTSD. I could see how discussion of rape may trigger rape survivors in this way. Separately, I think many of the people who demand trigger warnings in academic settings don't actually need them and just use them as a means of avoiding challenging material that they don't want to read or take offense to.\n\nWhich is a real shame. I always thought that one of the main points of college was to expand your world view by engaging with people and material that were different, challenging, and unfamiliar. ","If it's so rare, then why would entire events have a no clapping policy? ","Perhaps because they don't want to interrupt the event?","Well the example I'm thinking of specifically banned clapping for \"triggering\" not because of interruptions. Typically clapping is a normal thing, it's not disruptive unless at the wrong time.  ","Well, there are always some crazy people in every movement.","Agreed. ","&gt; violence.\n\nIf violence is so traumatic that it requires a 'trigger warning', why does this post exist? Why was Deadpool shown instead of zoolander 2? Why is there a 700+ karma post in this same thread that makes the claim that ' The \"sensitive college campus\" crowd that people like to rail on doesn't give a shit about graphic sex or violence '?","Because:\n\n1. Nobody needs a trigger warning for violence on an action movie.\n2. Zoolander 2 being offensive *has nothing to do with trigger warnings*.","I challenge anyone that agrees with trigger warnings to provide me a FULL list of ALL triggers, don't skip any unless you think one persons triggers are more important then someone else's. So far nobody can do it because it's impossible. An example is dogs, someone may have been ferociously attacked by dogs as a kid and permanently scarred so anything with a dog in it must now have a trigger warning. Clowns, balloons, hamburgers, rape, bleach, piercings, uncles and coffee mugs probably trigger at least one person in the world. The possibilities are endless and why would those people be less important than someone else with a trigger?","&gt;victims of rape or sexual assault and suffer from PTSD-like symptoms.\n\nI think because a lot of this just doesn't describe a lot of the people who make a big fuss about it.\n\nFirst, most people aren't rape victims. That's just how it is. That isn't to say you should be a dick to actual victims...\n\nSecond, PTSD is a very serious thing that is being made light of a lot these days. Feeling uncomfortable or not liking what you're seeing is not a PTSD panic attack.\n\nThird, calling everything a \"trigger warning\" is just kind of dumb. Most things don't trigger people and most things like talking about something aren't going to trigger people. Triggers are specific things and often rather innocuous. Personally, I would just like to see a general warning like they do on HBO before stuff. Just something about calling everything a trigger warning seems so wrong to me.\n\n\nAnd basically most of these people are attention whores.","I think you've hit the nail on the head with your third paragraph there.\n\nA 'Trigger' is something that causes a serious, psychological reaction (e.g. a Soldier going into shock / panicking when they hear an unexpected firework, or a car backfiring).\n\nI can understand that an unexpected violent scene in a film could Trigger someone who has been assaulted / abused. However, Triggers are a symptom of PTSD, which is a very serious, diagnosed illness. Complaining that something needs a trigger warning, or that you've been triggered is insulting to people who actually have PTSD. Being shocked and / or offended by something isn't the same thing as being triggered.","&gt; general warning like they do on HBO before stuff\n\n\"This is Game of Thrones. It's so popular we're sure you know it's basicallly 40 minutes of tits and blood\"\n\nBut I think it's an interesting point to talk about how many people who talk a lot about it are actually victims. I'm very careful with talking about offensive things towards groups I don't belong to. I saw an ad once that I thought seemed very sexist, but I wasn't entirely sure, so I talked about it with a few female friends to see what they thought, and in this case they agreed.\n\nThen there's situations where it's a bit more vague. Jimmy Carr once joked \"I saw a transvestite in a miniskirt and thought 'That shows a lot of balls!'\". I'm a transperson myself and I thought that was hilarious, but another transperson might find it very offensive. Also, when it comes to Jimmy Carr I think he's often offensive in a way that isn't funny. I watched one of his shows and it felt like 90% of it was him implying he's a sexoffender. Not funny, in my oppinion, but my oppinion isn't law.\n\nI also have a hearingproblem, and when it comes to that, I am completely fine with people joking about it, because it normalises it. People don't have to joke about it all the time, but not less than one would with anything else about me.","[Read this article](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/) and you'll see why there is starting to be a massive pushback from behaviour like this. \n\nThe culture of being offended for other people is ridiculous. Not every offensive topic is worth going on a crusade to stop all dialogue about it. ","I think the issue is where does it end? What about murder? What about any accidental death? There is someone, somewhere, who will find it traumatic. There are hundreds of things that are horribly scarring, but if you put a trigger warning before all of them, you'd be doing never-ending trigger warnings. It's the same as jokes. MOST jokes are offensive to someone. If I make a crack about retarded people, my friend may get offended because his brother has autism. Then, next week, he makes a joke about murder, which would be much more offensive and horrible to those who find it offensive.","Because they called it \"trigger warning\"\n\n","But most of the time they have not been victims. \n\nMost PTSD suffers do not make a big deal out of their affliction. They'll have a quiet word with whoever they need to if they have an issue because, surprise surprise, people with PTSD don't normally like everyone knowing about it.\n\nHowever, if you're lying about being a victim or having PTSD or just wanting to argue in general, you leap at the chance to stir a controversy. It's the whole point for them.","I think a lot of the time it's more about being annoyed with people being offended on others' behalf. I find a lot of those who get outraged as a hobby lump all those who have been raped or sexually assaulted into one group as if everyone reacts or copes in the same way, without really asking them. Trigger warnings were originally meant for people with PTSD but they seem to be just one more thing to bash people over the head with and from personal experience I know that the things that trigger PTSD aren't necessarily very obvious. You can't put a trigger warning on everything because maybe a group of lads in soccer jerseys are the trigger or a piece of music or whatever. ","&gt;In any case I don't understand why people respond with such vitriol to people who presumably have been victims of rape or sexual assault and suffer from PTSD-like symptoms.\n\nBecause most of them do not have PTSD or have been sexually assault. To some of these people simply being asked out for coffee in a innocent manner is the equivalent of being raped. ","I will tell you why. \n\nIt is one thing to have a traumatic experience and have PTSD get triggered by certain cues similar to that experience. However, when it comes to people's opinions they should not be triggering others and its unacceptable for an adult to believe that others should have to censor their opinions to accomodate you. Mind you these are strangers, not your friends, and you are trying to control what they can say, what they can do, what they can watch on campus. Sometimes even where they can go. This is coming from someone who has anxiety issues so I understand that reality. ","&gt; presumably \n\nThere we have it, folks. Case closed.","Because free speech trumps whether those victims feel \"safe\" or not. The vitriol often comes response to those that believe free speech is not the priority and that people who espouse the priority of free speech should be harassed and fired from their jobs. This now happens on college campuses due to university administrators scared about losing federal funding. ","100% depends on college *and department*. I go to school at an almost all white, southern, some what conservative school. Go to the Computer Science department and you can say what ever. Go to the History department and have a shity teacher, then try and criticize any religion. Safe space alert. But yea some schools in the Northeast and California are ridiculous, like get assaulted for wearing a Trump short ridiculous. ","The programming board pulled the movie.  So its not that kids didn't show up for the movie, its that a movie was deemed too offensive to show to anyone who was planning on going to that event.","Noooo. The organizer tried to pick movies their audience would like to see? It's like they act like some kind of a small business or so.","That's not what the organizer said.  The organizer said it was because there were jokes that offended marginalized groups.\n\nI mean, we can pretend it was for a reason other than the stated reason, and that might be fun, but it's tough to make that case.","And then they picked Deadpool and not the critical acclaimed \"The suffering of the black gay transgender jew\". The PC Brigade seems pretty reasonable in their Stalinist censorship. Just get it, this is not the Femnazi SJW conspiracy who hates every probable offensive joke the article wants them to make.

Because they'll have to torrent a movie themselves instead of letting their school do it for them?","Title should read \"Students Too Easily Offended to Watch Zoolander 2, Choose Deadpool Instead\"\n\nI think the first factor behind this is just that Deadpool is a better movie than Zoolander 2 and I'd imagine more students wanted to watch it. But secondly, university students need to grow the fuck up and stop complaining at the drop of a hat. It's fucking pathetic, and all they're doing is devaluing their own education to the same people that they're asking to value it after graduation.

I always saw Blind Al as an example of his inability to be close to anyone (a rather common early theme) and how his utter fear of being alone was rather controlling of his actions.  After his transformation into Deadpool, his adjustment into what he had become took time to get use to, and that was when his character was his darkest, where after he began to accept what he was, he became more like the anti-Hero he was before the procedure.  Since the Movie glossed over his time adjusting to becoming what he is, it kinda skipped the rougher parts of his and Blind Al's relationship, and instead focussed on what it kinda became in later comic book runs.","To be fair, Mark Waid started the process with two miniseries.

Since cringing puts us on edge and makes us feel uneasy, it makes us prone to nervous laughter which is probably why I laugh more at the office than any other sit-com.","Interesting analysis.

Both characters have been in separated from society for many years though, so it makes sense that they would feel that way.","&gt;painting Benedict's as weird\n\nIf the first movie is anything to go off of, pretty much every character bar Christine Taylor's is weird, just outright ridiculous, and Zoolander and Hansel definitely weren't supposed to be the \"relatable\" characters, so i find it hard to believe they would ever be considered in the right unless the viewer was looking for it.\n\nI'm gonna have to watch the movie after this to make up my own mind, but the entire premise of the thing seems so outlandish and ridiculous that i can't imagine taking it seriously as a slight against transgender people.","The movie does paint them as being in the right. Like mocking the current music, style, personalities, technology, and, yes, sexuality. It plays from two older, out of touch people's perspective bewildered at the wild world. It's quite a departure from the original, which made them the obvious buffoons, whose ridiculous lifestyle seemed strange to the audience.\n\nEdit: Why don't you try actually watching the movie and telling me why I'm wrong, before downvoting me for not conforming to your preconceived notions, Reddit.","Alright;\n\n1) didn't downvote you, maybe don't talk about controvercial shit that people might disagree with if you don't want to be downvoted.\n\n2) just watched it. The entire buildup and scene was exactly what i thought it would be, over the top outlandish exaggerations of the way the world has changed since 2001 and the direction it's heading, just like the first movie. Cumberbatch's character encompasses this perfectly in regards to modern attitudes to gender, he's an over the top, eccentric fashion model who refuses to assign himself to any gender, is married to him-herself, is called \"All\" because he is \"All\" and only refers to himself in 3rd person. \n\nI couldn't take it seriously, it's a massive over-exaggeration of being genderfluid, not even necessarily transgender, and it was presented in a world where all things are over-exaggerated, including the hipster he was standing next to who was just as ridiculous.\n\nZoolander and Hansel aren't painted in the right per-se. They themselves still have all the ridiculous qualities they had, and are no smarter than they were in the first movie. The joke is that they find the current state of things to be silly and confusing, while still holding on to the tiny phones, Zoolander's looks, over the top outfits and everything else that made them stupid characters. They could replace Cumberbatch with almost anything from the modern day, and the joke would still be the same.\n\nYes, they present All as a ridiculous character, but being transgender is the most grounded part of his character, his mannerisms, personality and shaved eyebrows were a lot more humorous than *what he is*. The entire concept had the same punch as \"I identify as an attack helicopter\" and just demonstrates how outlandish a concepts like genderfluidity *could be* if taken to the extreme, it's not the same as outright saying genderfluidity *is* stupid, moreso; here is a stupid character who is gender fluid, here is what a stupid character in a stupid world does to genderfluidity. \n\nMore to the point, it's definitely a joke, not meant to be anything more than funny. To take it the way you did, i feel takes a lot of inference, if not a desire to be offended by the content rather than objectively looking at what it is. I think you need to rewatch it and ask \"what is actually offensive about this?\" because from what i saw, there wasn't enough substance to actually allow it to be offensive. \n\nI think it's very much a case of offence being taken and not given.","I was at like -2 when I wrote that, and I was one of the very few to watch the movie apparently so it was kinda dumb to be downvoted for adding to the discussion(it wasn't directed at you). I hope you didn't watch the rest, cause it's a huge waste of time haha.\n\n I agree; I didn't see it as offensive. I can see how they did though. Was it justified? Probably not. When you feel the world is not accepting of your lifestyle, I imagine it can lead to being pretty sensitive. I don't know your state of mind, but I'm guessing you were probably watching it with the intent of proving yourself right, which is not the best way to be objective. I mostly agree though.","Actually i went into it thinking \"this is going to be shit, why am i even bothering?\", but actually kinda enjoyed it, which was the biggest shock.\n\nI expected the scene to be very in your face, but it was really short and just kinda slipped by, i had to rewatch it a few more times because i was genuinely surprised with how tame it actually was, given how it's been demonized.\n\nTo be honest i was disappointed because it was a little too easy to defend. You're right that i definitely would have went out of my way to prove myself right if it was bad, i was ready to go to war, but now i'm just genuinely bamboozled about what the fuss is about.\n\nI kinda feel sorry for the kind of person who would be offended by it, because first of all they only identify themselves by their gender or sexuality, there's no other way to relate to that character, and if that's all you are in your own eyes, that's just sad. Second, if this upsets them they're just not prepared for a run in with the kind of person who genuinely hates them just because of who they are, you cannot be trans and not have a thick skin, you're just not going to survive. But then again i've got a bad feeling most people who were \"offended\" weren't trans, gay or anything remotely close to what Cumberbatch was, they were just people looking to complain about something.","All good points I can agree with, especially the thick skin part. This PC centered society is getting ridiculous. I really think it just came down to bad timing. If this had come out two years earlier(or even better, two years after the original) with the same joke, it would've killed. It was just a very hot topic this past year, people were bound to fight against any jokes about trans people.","zoolander 2 does treat transgender people like a joke. ","You're right that the joke was on Hansel for being clueless and inappropriate, but there's more to the joke than just that. The character of All may or may not be transgender, the movie doesn't say. All we see of All is that he/she/xe is androgynous (which is *not* the same as trans, just ask the late David Bowie) and insufferably pretentious. It actually was a brilliant, if short, skit, and Benedict Cumberbatch played the role perfectly.\n\nEven if All was intended to be a trans person, there are people who cannot tell the difference between \"laughing at a person who happens to be trans\", and \"laughing at a person for being trans\". Or rather, it's not that they *can't* tell the difference, but they *choose* not to see the difference, because outrage is much more fun.","This is actually the hallmark of a good clown. In clowning, the clown should place themselves below or at the level of the audience, and then become the joke, giving permission  to the audience to laugh at themselves without laughing at themselves.","So you can't make fun of anyone, because everyone is a minority depending on the location.","So you're going to willfully pretend like you don't know what the context is here? Lame.","Actually reading other people's arguments is the hallmark of an SJW /s.","You got downvoted, but you're right. White people in South Africa are a minority. It really does depend on the location.","And hetero people are a minority in a gay-bar. And males are a minority in certain jobs (nurses...). ","You hope hetero people are a minority in a gay bar, not always the case if you're somewhere shitty \n\nEdit: not implying straight people are unwelcome or shitty but when you show up to a gay bar and there's not a lot of gays it's kind of a sign to go somewhere else ","Maybe if you didn't go elsewhere there wouldn't be so few!","It's not just minority, though, it's power. White people in SA held governing power for years as colonizers. So even if they're technically minority they would still be considered greater in terms of power balance. ","Where was the movie made/played? Oh yeah, right. \n\nI'm not saying PC is good. I'm saying that this argument isn't. It doesn't even need an argument. Just say \"no\". ","I'm at a point where I think people need to be offended more. And they need to realize that being offended doesn't give them any special rights.\n\nStephen Fry said it best.","South Africa: the official sponsor of \"black people can be racist too\" arguments","*White people in South Africa are a minority*\n\n Or in California","....depending on the location.  Problem is that this is America, so white people aren't the minority.  You can argue they are in some parts of it, but the structure of our society still benefits white people overall. (This shouldn't be controversial, but it is).  Even in black neighborhoods, black people are still targeted more than white people.  Get pulled over more, etc.\n\nBecause of this, it doesn't hurt me at all if someone calls me a cracker.  I mean I may feel a *little* insulted, sure, but white people simply aren't impacted by anti-white slurs.  You have entire shows that operate off negative stereotypes of white people (like Chapelle's Show)...and there was no outrage, because to white people in a white-controlled country, it's just not a threat.\n\nIf I were in *Japan*, though, a country that actually is somewhat hostile to white people (although historically not as hostile as white people have been to black people in the US), being called the Japanese equivalent of \"cracker\" probably would start to get to me, because it would be paired with actual systematic discrimination, because non-Japanese people are just outsiders in Japan, even if they grew up there.  The last Miss Japan actually got a lot of shit in her country because she's half-black, half-Japanese, even though she *grew up* there her entire life.  She's still an outsider.\n\nSo location does matter a lot.   ","You can make fun of anyone but being mean spirited about it makes it less funny and more offensive. If the joke was centered on how the characters were confused or conflicted and it put the focus on them instead of'lol trannies are weird right?' It wouldn't be offensive.","I thought it was funny.  The problem here is the insanely liberal pussies in colleges that are constantly claiming to be offended on other people's behalf.  They're a cancer.","Can I have an example of zoolander 2 doing this?","Which is why it's been on every network sitcom show ever. For it being garbage why do people eat that shit up.  And people wonder why bush got elected twice","It's akin to using blackface.","It's a Hallmark of Adam Sandler's work. Generally Rob Schneider plays the aforementioned minority in the most offensive way possible. ","\"Punching down\" is only a problem if you're obsessed with framing absolutely everything in terms of power. Humor can point out the absurd and ridiculous in all people. It doesn't care about power. Trying to regulate who you're allowed to make fun of is trying to create a power struggle where there is equality. It doesn't make society better, it's just divisive and stupid. \n\nNot all jokes are \"punching\", sometimes you make them simply to acknowledge that in the realm of humor people are the same. It's simply not always malicious, sometimes it's simply about leaving behind politics and class divides and what not and just having a laugh.","[deleted]","That's not what \"punching down\" means.\n\nThat term is describing the actions of the **writers**,  not the characters.  If a character is unreasonably mean to someone that doesn't deserve it, the humor is coming from laughing at how *god awful* the mean character is being.\n\nYou're not endorsing that behavior when you laugh, you're admonishing it.  So you're not punching down.\n\nIf the same thing happened where the  \"mean\" character was being presented as the \"good guy\", that would be a different story.  You never see that happen though.\n\nPrime example;  Rickety Cricket in \"It's Always Sunny\".  We're clearly meant to feel bad for cricket, while laughing at how absurdly cruel the gang is.\n\nIf you think the gang are good people, you severely missed the point.","In general yes, but there's is a gap between someone making fun of e.g. the British aristocracy vs. some poor people on welfare. If not done carefully the latter can seem mean spirited or even suggesting that they're beneath contempt.\n\nLike, making fun of David Cameron for being an out of touch toff vs. David Cameron burning £50 in front of a homeless man.","Yea but a joke about a poor person isn't \"Haha, you're poor\", a joke about a poor person is something like \"Your mama is so poor, I saw her walking around with one shoe and asked if she lost a shoe, and she replied: No I found one!\" Poverty can be the cause of the humorous and unexpected, but that doesn't mean people being poor is a joke somehow. ","Very true. That's why I added the caveat about \"if not done carefully\" - it's very possible to have good jokes when \"punching down\" but if clumsy or lazy can read very differently.","&gt;David Cameron burning £50 in front of a homeless man.\n\nat least hes consistent with the war on drugs","Poor \"rednecks\" are made fun of a regular basis by all forms of media, and there is usually no complaint from anyone that those who do so are punching down. ","That would be an example of punching down that usually isn't cool. Unfortunately social justice has an issue with ignoring classism.","In my opinion everything in comedy is fair game so as one of those \"rednecks\" I usually laugh along and definitely see some truth  the stereotypes, which is what makes it funny. People take themselves far to seriously, if you can't take a joke the problem is likely with you not the comedian. ","Good hypothetical. David Cameron burning money in front of a homeless guy sounds way funnier. Where did this idea that comedy wasn't supposed to be mean-spirited ever come from?","Except the latter actually happened.

","I could see either of those to be hysterical, depending on how they were written \n\n","Or, it's a  problem if you see everything  as being racist, sexist, or homophobic. ","With the social justice crowd there is a pervasive idea that all of those things are only possible if you have power. To them it's ultimately all about power and hierarchies.","They're like Marxists, but with Race struggle instead of Class Struggle.\n\nRace Struggle generally implies Class Struggle; but it perpetuates the stereotypical poop black social structure that needs help from the white bourgeois society. This is why they get mad when you ask if a homeless man has more privilege than Obama. You're pointing out that a much better fight is that of Class but in reality they want to become part of the Bourgeoisie, not eliminate the white bourgeois class. In their perfect world they just want the black minority and the ultra-rich minority to align perfectly, instead of ending the constant exploitation. That shift in goals is primarily why this new wave of SJ is so insane","Pffft. It also ignores years of comedy being successful punching down. There's even a word for the type of humor, and it's generally regarded as a higher form of wit(although I personally dislike ridicule.)","Making fun of people specifically to put them down isn't a good thing no matter who you're \"punching\". People who can laugh each other and themselves however don't need to be told they can't enjoy a bit of banter and joking back and forth without having to adhere to some kind of hierarchy.","never enjoyed a good roast have you? Hey to each there own, but seems kind absurd to imply its moral superior to be above a historic type of humor. ","Roasts are hilarious, but they aren't done to hurt a person. The person agrees to be there to be roasted.","The thing about a roast, is that the roastee generally agrees to it ahead of time and knows that it's all in good fun.\n\nContext is important.  ","There's at least a thousand jokes made about autistic forever-alone neckbeards on Reddit each and every day. Absolutely no one who makes these jokes is \"punching up\" in any way, shape, or form whatsoever. So obviously punching down is ok sometimes, as long as you're punching down at the people it's socially acceptable to punch down at.","You're right that it happens all the time here, but it's still pretty much garbage as far as comedy goes. People make those jokes usually at some other poster they're in a little slapfight with because they want to be a dick. A lot of people come on reddit just to be a dick and get in little pissing matches. There's also the /r/cringe element where people are laughing from afar to sort of boost themselves up in comparison to the autistic neckbeards or whatever.\n\nIn both cases, it's just stupid and probably not all that healthy mentally. Surely wouldn't make for a good comedy movie. ","Autism accusations are the most ridiculous insults you can ever see online, it's Troll go to material and it feeds itself.","Those jokes are terrible and repetitive though, so I think you just refuted yourself.","People who make those jokes on reddit aren't professional comedians. They can punch up and down and all around.","To add on, most of those jokes are low effort memes. The bottom of the barrel. ","And almost none of them are original ideas.

That's why every askreddit thread has the exact same tired jokes about broken arms and jolly ranchers or what have you.","You put your stereotypes in, you put your stereotypes out.

Not that it's offensive, it's just lazy, easy, badly written, in short; not funny. Like Zoolander 2, and most of the \"anti-PC\" stand up comedians out there.

Rather, it's a principle. Silencing speech is bad. \n\nSo take that logic here...why should we be thought-policing *anyone's* reasons for deciding not to show a movie to their audience on a screen which they own? Why are they *only* allowed to cancel a movie if it's for \"approved reasons\"? Shouldn't they be permitted to screen whatever movie they want for whatever reasons they feel are appropriate?\n\nOr do you just hate freedom?  \n\n;)","Well, institutions that are open to the public have always been held to a higher standard than private individuals.

My grandmother was a Clinton supporter for two things. Her name, and the fact that she was a woman*. It took a few weeks but now she likes Sanders after hearing both of their views. Sadly, this isn't in the US but just saying that people can be won over. ","I think name recognition is the best explanation for Hillary and Donald's success. ","Hillary's \"name recognition\" comes from 25 + years of public service. \n\nSecretary of State of the United States of America. \n8 years as senator of the State of New York.\n8 years as First Lady of the United States.\n13 years as First Lady of the state of Arkansas.\n\n\"Name recognition\" \n\n","It's mostly being first lady of the U.S. and then running for the dem nomination in 2008. You can have 30+ years of public service as a senator and not have name recognition because only a few politicians are known by the majority of citizens. Most people can't name a single Congressman or Senator from a state other than their own. And they probably can't even name all of the ones from their own state. Same goes for Governors and Mayors.","It actually came from being the first lady involved in a huge scandal...","Or an extreamly public fight for universal health care. Or her very public denouncing of human rights abuses while visiting China..\n\n","All that needs is \"A lifetime of crime and corruption, priceless\" at the end ","How is voting within the system a revolution? ","A revolution doesn't have to be a violent overthrow of a system from the outside. A revolution can come from the inside of a system, and be peaceful at the same time, without losing any of its legitimacy. All that's required is a radical shift in how the system operates.\n\nNow, I would argue that Bernie isn't honestly all that radical. Most of his ideas are just good, common sense, politically and economically, but the fact that he's gaining so much traction when America has been opposed to these ideas for so long is what makes this a revolution (albeit a very peaceful one, which I consider a wonderful thing).","indeed. in most other countries, bernie doesn't qualify as a radical at all. it's just our political system is so corrupt that having anybody who speaks about actual reality at all in the public sphere is revolutionary.","I don't think we even know what a revolution is. It's been a buzzword in our society for so long that it's lost any intrinsic meaning somewhere in the mid-90s during an ad campaign for children's toys or something. Even if a revolution could happen through a broken voting process, I'm not sure it can come from the presidential seat. Everyone seems to have forgotten the job description of the president of the United States of America and it is frustrating. They are the head of the armed forces. They can pardon people. They can appoint ambassadors and judges to the Supreme Court. Nowhere does it say they can pass laws to stimulate a revolution. Even with the questionable executive order functions of the president, I don't see anything major changing socially. Sure I would love to see real true positive change that I don't have to exchange my freedoms for...but this situation is almost identical to Obama and we all know that hope and change can't make a revolutionary paradigm shift occur. ","It's still no revolution. Even a peaceful one would need to overthrow the political system to be called a revolution.","Well, for 1) Any other kind of revolution would be a federal crime and 2) How else are we going to achieve change? Go ask the pure anarchists how well not partaking in the system is getting the fall of government or sinn Fein refusing to be in parliament is helping out that northern irish cause. \n\n","The RNC prefers HRC over Trump.

We're trying to spread our message, but they're on every corner we go.","Serious question, does Bernie even have a legit shot of winning the nomination at this point?"," Are his chances slim? yes but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a chance. There are still a lot of possibilities for him to win the nomination. Assuming there's not voter suppression and fraud in the up coming states (which there will be) he would mostly win all the big states. Now assuming he loses those states based off the voter fraud that has been going on, Bernie can still take it all the way to the convention and try to convince superdelegates that he is better at beating Trump in the general than Hillary, since Hillary only appeals to old loyal democrats, and Bernie appeals to all other demographics, which greatly out numbers the old loyal democrats. As of right now, Hillary doesn't appeal to anything else, and isn't trying to appeal to the demographics that support Bernie, she kind of just expects them to vote for her without doing anything to win them over. But I can tell you that a big % of Bernie supporters hate Hillary, and will not vote for her no matter what. If the superdelegates look at the facts, then turning to Bernie would be the only way to prevent a republican from taking the white house. \n\n\nThere's also the possibility that Hillary will be indicted. Again, if the superdelegates are smart, they would not put all their eggs in the Hillary basket, because if she gets indicted if she is the nominee, that's like handing over Trump the keys to the white house. \n\n\nNow in order for Bernie to appeal to the superdelegates, he may not have to necessarily win most of these states going forward, but he does have to get as many votes as possible in every state. So the Bernie supporters turning on Bernie, or giving up on him are not helping his case if they want him to really be the nominee. \n\n\n","lol u/fedart","Yeah","Likely? No. Legit?

Further, many polls show democrats want the speeches released which shows they do care about it.\n\nAs an aside, I agree with the other guy, you cannot (meaningfully) regulate an industry that financially supports you.

But we need to stop crying wolf at every state we don't win so when shit like Arizona and New York happen people can't be like \"oh there they go again saying the system is rigged.\"","&gt;troll amount is well over 10x what it was prior to NY\n\nBecause Bernie was crushed in NY and people on Reddit are sick and tired of constant spam for a candidate who has no hope anymore?\n\n&gt;neither candidate is near being mathematically eliminated\n\nFair point, I should've said that barring a miracle, he's essentially done for, unless you think he can pull off a 58% win in all of the states remaining, including those on Tuesday, and I'm pretty sure he's currently behind in all of them.\n\n&gt;conveniently ignoring shenanigans in arizona, massachusetts, washington, wyoming, new york that have measurable impact on results\n\nWell considering both campaigns have asked for investigations in Arizona, I'd say we can rule that one out. Considering that Bill Clinton broke no laws and it's doubtful that his presence had a huge effect on the results, we can rule that out. I'm not as sure about what happened in Washington and Wyoming. And your point about New York is completely laughable. It was registered Democrats who were purged from the record, who prefer Clinton over Sanders by polling. Additionally, assuming that the purged voters are a random sample of the overall sample, they would've still been mostly for Hillary. All in all, New York's issues actually helped Hillary.\n\nSo really, unless you're saying all of these small things added up to a few million votes, then yes -- Bernie is not as popular as Hillary and is lacking in those votes.","[deleted]","Apparently you're a low information voter and not worth my time.","Just fyi: your subreddit no longer makes the front page.

Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nMaybe I was over-interpreting your argument before. But this seems to be the core of it.  And I still disagree. \n\nEvidence that requires a conspiracy theory to become more complicated IS evidence against the conspiracy theory. Yes you can say \"well they could have just done that to cover their tracks.\" But it makes the conspiracy theory look less strong. \n\nCould God have put the fossil record into the ground to try to trick us into thinking there was evolution when really there wasn't? Sure he could have. But that doesn't mean the fossil record isn't evidence for evolution. \n \n","&gt;Evidence that requires a conspiracy theory to become more complicated IS evidence against the conspiracy theory. Yes you can say \"well they could have just done that to cover their tracks.\" But it makes the conspiracy theory look less strong. \n\nI see where you're coming from with that, but it's only partially accurate. Occam's razor is a very valuable concept, but a common misinterpretation is that it lends validity to the simplest explanation, by virtue of it being the simplest. That is a logical fallacy, because it conflates percentage of likelihood with percentage of validity. It is a heuristic tool, and its value lies in deciding which hypothesis to prioritize when testing *because of its relative likelihood*. It does not mean that more complicated hypotheses are not to be tested. Otherwise, people with rare diseases would be going untreated left and right because of Occam's razor.\n\nAnyway, following my game theory logic, assuming there were some actor interfering with voting in some rational way, it would *hurt* Hilary's campaign to leave voter suppression out of Indiana, because only having voting suppression in states where it can be argued that it benefits her makes a \"conspiracy\" way more believable. Including it does not help her, but it avoids hurting her. A distinction between loss/neutral is just as much of a net gain as a distinction between neutral/gain.\n\nThe God example is entirely different. For starters, God would not be practicing game theory (which is based on human psychology and behavioral patterns, not divine ones) in a competitive landscape by placing fossil records in the ground. There's also the fact that the fossil record thing is not a \"potential\" action in a sea of \"concrete\" events; it is a \"potential\" action in a sea of \"potential\" events. There's a million other examples I'd rather not get into, because this segue is only superficially analogous to the rest of this discussion.\n\nEDIT: For what it's worth, I agree with you strongly that the logic required to support some sort of \"premeditated conspiracy\" gets very silly. I believe what's actually happening is that it's an overly complicated system, perpetuated by Republicans/conservative Democrats, that is breaking down left and right because of the exaggerated effort required to keep it moving flawlessly. If there's any \"conspiracy\", its only that Hillary's campaign is ignoring a broken system for the time being, because it does not help her to address it (shes already winning by a landslide so even if it hurts her more it doesn't matter), and if she did address it, it'd only serve to *possibly* help Bernie (because it might hurt him more). I just think that its important to keep argument for/against a conspiracy closer to those rails.\n","Uh, what? You can discuss game theory impartially.\n\n I legitimately don't know whether or not it's a conspiracy or widespread incompetence. I'm leaning toward it being preexisting institutional incompetence that Hillary is just capitalizing on because it has worked in her favor. However, I *do* know a thing or two about that type of strategy, and I know that any rational actor who's intelligent enough to run a political campaign, were they to set up some widespread conspiracy, would account for that fact when a schmuck like me was able to within a few seconds.\n\nI'm criticizing calling registration errors in Indiana evidence against a conspiracy. Nothing more, nothing less. There are much better, much more secure arguments against the recent voter fraud being a conspiracy, such as the obscene difficulty in obtaining an absentee ballot in NY when absentee ballots massively favor Hillary.","PA is also significantly older than NY. Les 18-29's. I think it is the 3rd oldest state in the nation.","More trolling? That's all you do here.","Damn with that it kind of seems hopeless. ","Some people have jobs during the week. Some people realize that Bernie has lost unless Clinton has a serious scandal. You can't blame people for losing heart.","&gt; Bernie won Lations in Nevada\n\nBy winning them in exit polls, and then heavily losing their districts? Those exit polls were as accurate as NY's.\n\n&gt;will win them by enormous margins in California\n\nSure he will. Just like he was going to win black voters outside of the south. ","At this point, we're not debating facts. I'm out of here.","Even 538 had an article about how the Nevada Latino Exit polls turned out to be inaccurate. \n\nThere really aren't any real facts that suggest Sanders is going to win Latinos. \n\nHe has lost them in almost every race so far. Even in his wins like Colorado, Hillary's best districts were heavy Latino. ","Get the fuck out of here troll.","Independents can vote for Bernie in CA but not the Republican candidate.","[deleted]","Remember that Bernie gains and gains as time goes on. He has more than a month to build up a big lead in California. Since it's this close now, I'd be worried if I was Hillary. Look at polling averages and how they trend, and you'll see what I mean.","lol","I agree with you on New Jersey, but I think he's got a good shot to take California. The fact he's leading with Latinos is huge.\n\nBut he likely won't win the nomination at this point, short of a miracle or him growing the balls to file lawsuits in Arizona and New York. (And possibly Illinois.)","That's amazing. Thank you!","It's because many Hillary supporters don't know about Bernie, and just think Hillary is okay. As we campaign and volunteer in a state, Bernie goes up and Hillary goes down, since he just has a better message.

We promised Japan complete and utter annihilation should they not give up with an unconditional surrender. They were already in talks of a conditional surrender, but we weren't satisfied due to our total war unconditional surrender moto during WW2. \n\nSo instead of waiting for the Soviets to join, or merely setting a blockade and continuing with the fire bombings, we decided to test out our brand new nuke technology. However even after the nukes were dropped, despite all the damage, the Japanese held on to a hope of achieving a conditional surrender, since the Soviets hadn't invaded yet. But once the Soviets finally entered the war, soon after the bombs were dropped, that made the Japanese give up any hope in achieving a conditional surrender.\n\nSome (many) theorize that the atomic bombs were more likely used as a power play, to show the Soviets &amp; the rest of the world the complete and utter destruction that the U.S. was capable of, and to make an example of the Japanese, using their non-immediate unconditional surrender to justify the nukes dropped, when they would have likely surrendered soon anyways, even without a land-invasion of Japan.","IIRC the Emperor of Japan at the time balked after the Hiroshima bombing, assuming that we only had one nuke.","Fuck that. This is basically Israel's method of bombing the fuck out of the Palestinians and it doesn't really do much but cause more harm and hatred and revenge. \n\nIronically, it's also the same philosophy Hitler had when he was trying to gas the Jews. ","Hitler was trying to wipe entire peoples off of the Earth with the gassing. You're really referring to the Blitzkrieg strategy which was super-intimidating and discouraged resistance.\n\nAlso, there's a difference between beating an opponent so much nobody wants to oppose you and indiscriminately attacking people (though my use of a *Tropic Thunder* quote was probably ill-advised for this point).","&gt; You're really referring to the Blitzkrieg strategy which was super-intimidating and discouraged resistance.\n\nNo, I'm talking about the entire genocide of a particular culture to the point they no longer exist. That's the entire point of the scorched earth metaphor.\n\nThe entire point of the Blitzkreig aka lightning war was just to invade before anyone knew what was going on. The reason they were invading was to get resources and land gains. It's why the Nazis allied with the Russians to take over Poland and split the loot.","&gt; A scorched earth policy is a military strategy that targets anything that might be useful to the enemy while advancing through or withdrawing from an area. Specifically, all of the assets that are used or can be used by the enemy are targeted, such as food sources, transportation, communications, industrial resources, and even the people in the area.\n\nAnd a paragraph later:\n\n&gt; A scorched earth policy was famously used by Joseph Stalin against the German Army's invasion of the Soviet Union in the Second World War,[1] by William Tecumseh Sherman during his March to the Sea in the American Civil War, by Lord Kitchener against the Boers, and by the Russian army during the failed Napoleonic invasion of Russia.\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article on \"Scorched Earth\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_earth","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthaginian_peace","No, \"Scorched Earth\" is laying the area to waste. Genocide is not inherently scorched Earth, especially not the way the Nazis did it.","Scorched earth is basically decimating the entire region and destroying everything, including people, to the point that it's inhabitable.","&gt; to the point that it's inhabitable.\n\nFirst, I believe you meant *un*inhabitable. Second, that's not how the Holocaust was carried out. Third, I just finished a second reply to your previous comment which covered that it's not that extreme.","Doh, yeah. Uninhabitable.\n\n","Decimating is taking out only one tenth.  It is the opposite of what most people think it means.  Not total destruction but a very restrained meting out of punishment.","Decimating originally meant taking one tenth, but the modern usage just means to kill or destroy a large portion of something. Language evolves. ","I guess I didn't get the memo on that one.  Much like I didn't get the memo that \"literally\" has evolved in a matter of a few years to mean the exact opposite.  ","[It's not as if it's a new development](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/09/does-decimate-mean-destroy-one-tenth/). According to this, the word originally referred to tithing money rather than the Roman practice of punishment. If we treat \"killed or destroyed a large portion\" as an incorrect use of the word, then using it to mean \"killed one tenth\" is just as incorrect. \n\nThe literally/figuratively thing is a very rapid example of a word changing meanings, but considering how different the English language is now than it was a few hundred years ago, it's ridiculous for people to be upset that a word like \"decimate\" has changed meaning over the years.","Now you're just playing semantics.","Thanks mate!","Props here to the guy front right: he sees his mate launch the first paddle and he *instinctively* covers his own nuts with the paddle still in his hand.

Are you sure gay guys have enough patience to actually exchange words before sex? Seems to me like one guy would just start fucking the other one and if he doesn't like it then oh well. \n\nSorry.

They aren't a top or a bottom, so they're called a \"side\".\n\nI think straight people overestimate how much butt sex is going on between us guys. The majority of all my hookups have been trading blowjobs, mutual masturbation, and frotting. ","\"Frotting\"  short for \"frottage?\"","Is \"docking\" really a thing?","Yes, but it's not that popular, especially in the US since it requires a foreskin.","Huh, TIL.","&gt;causal sex","Every gay sex interaction starts with 4 magical words, \"what are you into?\" In my opinion this is where most gay people get it right and most straight people get it wrong. When 2 straight people agree to hookup it's already unspoken and assumed that this girl is going to get fucked, there typically isn't any, \"what are you into\" talk because there's really no perceived need, it's already known by both parties. With gay encounters, there's typically a conversation after consent is reached, negotiations are drawn up (figuratively) and fetishes are placed on the table for discussion. \n\nEdit: for people wondering about the deleted comment above mine, it was basically just asking how gay people go about negotiating sex. \n","Sounds a bit like mild Game of Thrones politics....

If anything, you are attacking the daughter here, not the mom, and at least according to rumors that have been posted here in the past, the daughter doesn't like mom much more than you or I do. \n\nThere are PLENTY of good reasons to attack Fallin, there is no need to beat up on her family at the same time. ","Unfortunately, as an elected official, Fallin is held to different standards than unelected people. When you use state property as your own to park a private trailer on, it isn't good. Furthermore, as far as I know, the Fallin family has at least one other home...so why did she use state property, which in the end was illegal? It's not an attack on her family, it's an attack on her judgement.","Out of all the harm her and her cohorts are doing to the state, focusing your attention on that actually hurts your case. Most people really don't care about it.\n\nYes, the violation technically is \"illegal\", but so is Jaywalking. Would her getting a jaywalking citation warrant mention a year later?\n\n&gt; Oklahoma City’s city code prohibits travel trailers from being used a dwelling for more than 14 days in a calendar year.  \n\n&gt; The governor’s mansion is exempt because it’s state property.\n\n&gt; But according to KFOR, the trailer violates a different ordinance:\n\n&gt; The Capitol Medical Center Improvement Zoning Commission does state that you cannot have a trailer on state property in a certain area, which includes the governor’s mansion.\n\nIt was a minor zoning violation and with three conflicting laws, it is understandable how she could have thought it was legal. Once the correct law was pointed out, the issue was corrected promptly.. But over a year later you are still attacking her over it. \n\nIt's such a petty thing. It wasn't a political fuckup, it was a relatively minor *personal* fuck up. \n\nAgain, *please don't take this as defending her*, that is not my intention. **She is a terrible governor who is hurting the state.** But focus your criticisms on the things that matter. Personal shit like this makes you look as bad as it makes her look.","Although the zoning law by itself is petty, I don't think criticizing a person in such a high office for something like this is. Allowing nepotism or cronyism to create unfair advantages while not bothering to investigate either the law or the perceptual consequences is symptomatic of leadership that lacks foresight. In the context of my original post, I used this example as an almost absurd combination of the two and not as an ad hominem attack on Fallin herself. So no, this is not \"personal shit\".","I completely agree with criticizing her, as I have said all along.\n\nAnd while *you* might not mean to make it personal, [that certainly has not been the case with  everyone](http://jezebel.com/ok-governor-mary-fallins-loser-adult-kids-are-living-at-1720657894).\n\nBut how do you know that she didn't investigate the laws? That seems like a big leap to me. I suspect she almost certainly DID check with her staff-- and was told that since it is state property, it was legal.\n\nSeriously, if you were in her position, would you think to check the Capitol Medical Center Improvement Zoning Commission rules to verify that they don't override the laws that would apply virtually everywhere else in the state?\n\nTo me, it was an innocent mistake that even a staff lawyer could easily have made. Even the media initially said the arrangement was legal before finding the fairly obscure rule that changed that. \n\nAs for cronyism, I don't buy it. Normally with a zoning violation, the violator is given the chance to address the issue prior to facing fines. That seems to be exactly what happened here. She unintentionally violated the code, and once it was brought to her attention, she addressed it. *That is how the law should work.*\n\nI agree the governor should not get special treatment, but I also think she should not get \"special abuse\". It seems to me that the situation was handled pretty much exactly as it would have been for anyone else (And yes, you certainly can find egregious examples to the contrary, but they are the exception, not the rule).","I'm glad that she had it removed, because in comparison to the lawmakers in the legislature and their actions, she seems rational. As for cronyism/corruption in Oklahoma, it goes back decades at the highest levels. If you truly are a recent transplant to Oklahoma, you should know it struggles with transparency and accountability. Things happen behind closed doors, without the public knowing all too often, and they purposely keep people uninformed. Furthermore, this example of the trailer is a perfect example of how things operate \"under the law\" in OK: do it without asking, if anyone gets mad, fix it or make it disappear. Basically, do not enforce the law if that law is inconvenient for whatever reason.

There are good people in government, I'm not denying that, but to not suspect that the head of government is not somehow influenced by a network of party members who generally don't care about the law if it hinders them is choosing to be blind. Is Fallin clean herself? Probably. Is \"Trailergate\" petty? By itself, yes. Was it misconstrued as a gross personal attack in some publications? Yes (but what isn't?). Does that make it \"off-limits\" to use to criticize her leadership? I don't think so. Much less has been used against people in politics, and usually things that aren't even technically illegal to insinuate even worse things.

If not, some legislator can still introduce it for you in an effort to secure your vote for his/her reelection later.\n\nSecond, this can just be a natural response to perceived change in the 'wrong direction.'

Liberals see the kinds of activity referenced in this article (tougher abortion laws, etc.), and conservatives see other proposals they don't like (e.g., Target's recent bathroom policy, and other legislation that might be passed in San Francisco or California with a similar idea in mind), and everyone is unhappy. This naturally results in people just trying to secure what they believe is right. And whoever has the majority perspective in that city or state will win the day on the legislation fight.

","To Obama's credit, most of those things would probably happen even if he didn't become president.  ","Nah, we have the economic collapse of 2008 to thank for recreational weed. Not any politician.

","I cant believe you think he really had the power to do that. He couldnt even close a place where we publicly admit to torture. This got him elected twice and he still couldnt do it. ","What kind of reasoning is that? He just doesn't have time? Or is it that he has some other priority that would be impossible if he tried to legalize cannabis? I'm sorry, but I just can't imagine how that excuse makes sense. ","I'm all for legalization, but there's nothing hypocritical about him not making a priority out of something just because he did it as a kid.

The dea is a federal agency not a congressional one.","Pretty sure he raided more dispensaries than any predecessor. ","To be fair though, there have been what, 3 presidents in office since the idea of a Marijuana dispensary existed.","And now there are more than ever. ","However I believe there were more raids during the Obama era than the Bush era","And there has been more Dispensaries open in the Obama era than the Bush era what's your point?","By keeping the Feds from shutting down medical and recreational sales in their respective states he's done an awful lot, actually. All of those people are breaking the law.","The ONLY reason this makes me happy even a little bit, even though it makes me sad: I had a student back during before his first term who was graduating. She announced one day that she was voting for Obama cuz he was going to legalize weed. I tried telling her that he really couldn't do that, it is Congress that makes laws and the DEA that schedules drugs and all that, but no. She told me that I was \"fucking stupid.\"\n\nOf course, this is the same girl that told me her shoes were expired. Middle of teaching math and I hear: \"My shoes is expired!\"\n\nI'm like, \"What?\"\n\n\"My damn shoes is expired!\"\n\n\"Wut?\"\n\n\"These shoes expired in January. It is May. See? There is a date right here!\"\n\nSo I put down my marker, turned off the overhead, made sure that the class was quiet, and said: \"Storm honey - shoes don't expire. They just kind of wear out. That is the date they were made.\"\n\n\"You don't know what the fuck you are talking about. I ain't wearin no expired ass shoes. Ima get me some new kicks.\"\n\nSure enough, she walked into class wearing a new pair of $200 Jordans the next day. She threw away her perfectly good, and equally expensive shoes.\n\nI didn't have the heart to ask her to check the date on them for fear of destroying her world view.\n\nShe went on to have two kids by two different fathers and last I knew was dealing crack and blowing dealers to get by.","His administration has given all power for marijuana regulation to the states and have openly said that they (the feds) will not interfere with the state's decisions. This has been huge for all the legalization progress we've seen in the last 4 years considering weed is still federally illegal and thus should be illegal throughout the U.S. (see U.S. Supremacy Clause)... way more than 'basically nothing' in my eyes. If the next president has a different view on the rights of each state to regulate marijuana it'll only be a matter of time before the feds come and fuck up our dispensaries. ","Okay well idk if he was *directly* involved, but since the time of his election, we have had multiple states make it recreationally legal.","Sure.

They are not listening to us the people's opinions anymore and we are basically non existent in their views. They change laws and make things illegal all the time. All that matters is if it suits them and if they will profit from it. I hope with every ounce of my being that weed is legal federally in the next 5 years. But it's just not likely with our government having all the control and power over it. We need to have another fucking woodstock is what we need to do.

I'd fucking love it if that could happen but it just won't.

I didn't know you meant medical you didn't specify but now that you did I completely agree. It will help it out a lot. But not sure where you are but some of us in the US have really shitty marijuana laws a few I can think of are NJ, Florida, Texas, and New York. They all have really shitty policies on marijuana and if they would all get decriminalized and legalized it would spread to nearby states.

I litteraly didnt say a word durring the whole trial unless specificly asked a question by the judge. The deputy that took me back to jail said that was complete bullshit.

My friend in Florida was fighting with his girlfriend over some stupid shit and she ended up calling the cops saying that he was gonna hit her or some shit and they came into the house, smelled weed and told him if he gives it to them nobody will get in trouble. He gave them a jar with like 25 grams in it and they ruled it over an ounce or something and he got a felony charge and 90 days of community service but his aunt is a lawyer so she got it all expunged and cleaned from his record somehow.

However, it wasn't exactly technically fully illegal, it was just basically illegal in practice due to some some weird legal things until the 1970s.  Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act in the 1970s.\n\nI believe at that point, marijuana was recommended to be temporarily put into the Schedule 1 categorization, but that 'temporary' part basically fell by the wayside.  I do believe that was at least partly, perhaps largely, related to the influence from the Nixon administration, but he didn't simply make marijuana illegal.\n\nReagan and Nixon both were pretty strongly against drugs, but neither of them technically made marijuana illegal themselves.  You might say that the influence of their administrations supported the laws, policies, culture, etc, though.  \n\nI personally think Obama has actually helped to lay the groundwork for things to perhaps happen soon - at least in his tone, he seems to somewhat push the conversation about needing drug and penal system reform, which is supported by his pardoning of many non-violent drug offenders that had excessive sentencing.  I think he's done far more than his predecessors, in general, and I suspect that there are movements in Washington to (fairly soon) make some changes - there are initiatives already proposed.  I don't think marijuana legalization has been his top priority, nor (probably) should it have been, but we'll see what happens in the next couple of years or so. \n\nI do think that it matters, though, for various reasons.  I'm not saying it's insignificant.  ","Well it was added to the FDAs drug scheduling, which means the DEA has policies in place for each level of scheduling.

There are grains of truth in what you're saying, but also big gaps.\n\nTo get back to the initial point, the president did not make marijuana illegal.

You cant just fix everything overnight. Those issues will take decades to solve.","&gt; A lot of people just don't like clouds of smelly smoke everywhere.\n\nWe also don't like drunk idiots.","And a lot of people don't like a guy stoned off his ass. Both ways overindulging is bothersome. \n\nMy argument is that when you're drinking you can have a few beers in a crowd without bothering anyone, but lighting a joint will bother a lot of people. Just because smoking will be legal doesn't mean everyone will be okay with smoking in public. \n\nI have nothing against smoking, even though I don't smoke myself anymore, but it's different to smoke than to drink a few beers. ","I agree, but you could vape half a gram or eat a cookie and not bother anyone.","That's true, but getting back to what started this thread, that's not going to affect alcohols social acceptance. You can eat a brownie before you go out, but that's not going to stop people enjoying drinking beer when they're out.","Some people just dont like weed and like alcohol or vice versa. You have to factor that in too.","Actually... looking at the OP and every comment in the tree of context- the point wasn't about lowering alcohol acceptance (it has been some lower comments points though).  \n\nThe OP was that cannabis will be the norm or non-taboo in the future,  one below about 'drunk idiots' (of either drug taken to extremes is unacceptable, then yours as if a guy smoking a joint will 'always' be unacceptable and as though that 'is' weed, where I suggested there are other methods and form doesn't necessitate 'drunk idiot' of the parent comment).\n\nSo I feel like you are changing the conversation and creating a strawman in our context chain by moving the goalposts to 'lowering acceptance' of alcohol, or saying people can eat a brownie now.  I already said they could eat or vape it, you're just restating that and claiming you were talking about something which via context, we weren't.","Haha wow you must have missed that comment about lowering alcohol's acceptance then. ","Haha..  Woops, yea, I missed [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/4g9tan/the_president_of_2036_probably_just_smoked_a/d2fu32t) ... I was drinking last night  \n  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  See, it should be less accepted.  \n\nI actually do think it will, over time, become slightly less accepted and common, but never erased.  I just imagine if there were coffee shops like Amsterdam competing with bars, that many people who would go out to bars, would substitute the 'safer' intoxicant.  I can see alcohol being looked down on slightly more than it is by self-righteous 'weed is better' folks and that kind of people becoming more common.\n\nI didn't realize there was one post on that context tree mentioning it lowering alcohol's acceptance though.  Speaking just to the one I was replying, I honestly think that while 'everyone' won't be okay with smoking in public (for good reason), there will be places to smoke in public.  Everyone isn't okay with drinking in public either, it's illegal most public places now and would be with cannabis too I bet.  I feel like in places one 'could use' cannabis when legal, that there are many functional ways to imbibe.  The big difference between smoking or drinking doesn't exist to me because you could literally sell and drink cannabis infused drinks (or food, or vape, etc).\n\nThanks for pointing that out though, I feel like an ass being all pedantic in my previous comment after I looked at the context last night.  ","Yeah, but you can mask getting a drink by saying you just like drinking beer like you would a soda even though everyone knows you just like getting drunk and you know everyone knows and everyone knows you know they know, ya know?","Obama basically called off the Feds on marijuana though, which is pretty significant imo. Drug users as a percentage of prison population has been decreasing. BTW, drug laws aren't responsible for our overpopulated prisons, 51% of our state prison populations are violent offenders -- it's the length of sentences, mandatory minimums, etc. and we need to reduce sentences for violent offenders, it's just much easier politically to say our prisons are stuffed \"non-violent drug offenders\".","Here in Hawaii it already is. ","As much as these are important things (things Obama should have worked harder to fix) there are actually more important things the US has to worry about. You are looking at serious domestic issues but the world is so much bigger than the US and the last 100 years have forced the US to deal with global issues everyday. And global consequences are far worse. ","I think it'll still be a lot longer than most people think. Some people just don't change their mind about stuff they believe in. Those people have to die or move away before that's a reality I think. ","I'm now imagining Trudeau and Obama toking in the Oval Office discussing some real important Head of State shit and eating munchies. ","Being president doesn't automatically grant you the ability to control everything in the U.S.\n\n","Legalizing weed won't fix the system of oppression set in place by the drug war. It'll fix some of it sure, but harder drugs will continue to oppress African Americans about it, and most people won't care because they have legal weed. I'm not disagreeing with you, but Obama is doing a lot to fix the prison industrial complex and that goes a lot further than legalizing pot."],["\"Of course across town the kids nana is smoking to ease her glaucoma.\"\n\n\"And it's good for arthritis too.\"","Honestly, if that was a bottle of alcohol, it wouldn't be a cool comic.

I didn't think that the child was the one playing the large role, but seeing it that way does generate some concerns...","How is not like cannabis in the context of the comic? If I'm feeling stressed and had a tough day at work and school a beer would be just as great as a joint when getting home. ","One of them also happens to be a considerably less harmful method of simmering down, after work, I guess.","Considerably less harmful? How harmful do you think having one beer is?

It is not healthy for one to think this way. I can't just one day say I'm a female so you have to let me use female facilities because fuck logic. ","&gt; Evidence suggests that people who identify with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth, may do so not just due to psychological or behavioral causes, but also biological ones related to their genetics, the makeup of their brains, or prenatal exposure to hormones.\n\nThe modern understanding of trans people is that it's actually quite likely that instead of trans people being delusional, there's evidence that their brain structure and whatnot are physiologically the same as the gender they identify as. Meaning it's a strong possibility that it is in fact their body's that require realignment instead of their psyche. \n\nRegardless of that, treating it purely as a mental illness, and trying to convince them that they truly are the gender they were assigned at birth, is not nearly as effective as allowing them to transition. \n\n&gt; I can't just one day say I'm a female so you have to let me use female facilities because fuck logic.\n\nTrans people usually go through hormone therapy, and transition socially well before using the bathroom of the gender they identify as. A very long, drawn out, and at times painful process. And when they do use the restroom, it's in fear. After all, while you may feel society has left you behind in their acceptance of trans people, there are still so many that are filled with hate and ignorance. I've seen many people on reddit say if they saw a trans person entering the wrong restroom they'd violently remove them. Which begs the question what happens when a trans person does use the bathroom of the gender they were assigned at birth? What if the observer confuses them as going into the wrong bathroom because of how they were presenting?\n\nIt's a whole big issue that could just be solved by trying to just have some understanding I think.","It's just not normal. I couldn't care less if you like men or women, but when you have those individuals who identify as a different gender it just gets ridiculous. You speak of \"genders assigned at birth\" as if there's plenty of options, you're either a male or female. yoh know what, I identify as 7 year old girl. If I, a 25 year old male, were to give the girl a kiss, what would you think? Would you accept that I identify as a seven year old girl and that kissing a little kid is child's play? Or would you immediately detain me and call the police? Put your family in this situation, see if you would be okay with it and accept that they identify as a little girl so it's okay. Ignore the fact that it's a 25 year old male. ","Do you identify as a 7 year old girl?","Will that change your answer? Because if it does then you proved me right. ","Do you?","Sure I guess. ","How long have you identified as 7?","Different guy here.I completely understand that. And I'm not saying they're wrong. I'm not saying they're making it up. People can honestly believe they are in the wrong body. I just dont agree with letting a man, use a woman's restrooms because he feels he's a woman. Until he's undergone physical changes, he's still a man. Like it or not. You can't make a bunch of women uncomfortable, or vice versa, because one person thinks he's in the wrong body. ","By \"undergoing physical changes\" do you mean passing as the gender they identify, or fully going through genital surgery?","Going through the genital surgery.","If they're already passing as the gender they identify as then there genitalia is a non issue in terms of using the bathroom I think. I mean I dont know about you but I don't get an eyeful of everyones genetalia when I enter the bathroom. And if you do happen to be closely inspecting someones genitals when their in a stall that seems pretty predatory in itself.\n\nOn the surface I think it's fairly reasonable to suspect that trans people go through the full transitional process. However, there are a multitude of factors at play that make this proposed mandate to a degree, an almost impossible barrier for many trans people. To start out it is majorly expensive to get the surgery, and many insurances don't cover it or very likely the trans person doesn't have insurance to begin with. Say they decide to save up for the surgery. In the mean time they still socially and hormonally transitioned, and while being able to use the bathroom the identify as poses virtually no risk of actual harm to others around them, using the bathroom of the gender that they aren't presenting as puts them at risk for having to out themselves which puts them at risk of things like sexual assault or physical violence. And those to are just an addition to the fact that they'd be outing themselves which in itself can be a great detriment to trans people.\n\n","Yea, i get what you say. And i see both sides of it...

Women swear that guys must be crazy to use urinals right next to each other. I've never really seen a guy give a good argument as to why they prefer it that way over stalls except hygiene, in which case there are still other options. \n\nIndividual bathrooms (not just individual stalls) seems like the actual solution to me. ","Are you serious?  Urinals save space, time, and cost.  Since you think individual bathrooms is a reasonable idea, you must not be thinking of the logistics.  The reason womens' restrooms often have longer lines is because you can fit a ton of urinals into a place, and people move quickly through them.  Even my local restaurant/bar would need to have a dozen little rooms, imagine a sports stadium.  That's crazy, and we don't need to do it just because less than 1% of the population is literally crazy.","There is definitely an economic argument to made for them, but ultimately that's not going to matter in the legal debate. Either trans people need to be accommodated (which probably means some Constitutional defense) or they don't (in which case nothing needs to change). \n\nEither way, it's not going to come down to economics or logistics. ","An extremely tiny group of people wont be able to force everyone to build something that isn't feasible.  Most places just couldn't do the individual rooms idea you stated.","I'd argue that there is no group arbitrarily small enough for a court to rule that their Constitutional rights are justifiably violated due to the pressure it would place on public venues. \n\nAnd most places already have two bathrooms in place: mens and womens. It's just a matter of whether or not they want to bother splitting those further down. ","There are men and women though.  There isn't \"splitting it down further,\" because this is just some peoples' mental state.  What you're proposing is changing everything, because a few people have a screw loose in their head.  We already have laws about accommodating the physically handicapped, this idea though isn't objective.  You're still not thinking about how unfeasible it would be to require stadiums, airports, etc to have little rooms for every single person who needs to pee.\n\nEdit: How do constitutional rights have anything to do with this?  No is having their rights or freedom taken away.  This is a new issue being made up.","I'm not saying \"need\" to. I'm saying that this is going to end up in court at some point, and at that point it will be resolved without regard for the financial strain of compliance. \n\nAs I said in my original post:\n\n&gt;_There is definitely an economic argument to made for them, but ultimately **that's not going to matter** in the legal debate. **Either** trans people need to be accommodated (which probably means some Constitutional defense) or they don't (in which case nothing needs to change)._\n\n&gt;_Either way, it's not going to come down to economics or logistics._\n\nI'm not trying to defend them. I'm merely pointing out that people are having two different conversations (whether or not they deserve those rights, and whether or not individual bathrooms are economically feasible).\n","I thought I addressed both points.   What does \"trans people\" mean really?  Laws about bathrooms and accessibility has always been a physical issue.  We are going to be a really nutty nation if our whole system is turned on its head because a small amount of people have mental issues.  These people are asking for new rights, they want to be able to do things they aren't allowed to now, because of something they claim is in their brain.  I can't think of any precedent.","You mean that all disorders are binary?  Or are you just confused?\n","....humans within the normal range of a bell curve have XX or XY chromosome pair. Some rare individuals will have an extra sex chromosome acquired as a mutation during meiosis. It's quite simple, if you're confused I can pull out my textbooks from before I started my biochemistry PhD","It's so sad when learned people use their knowledge for evil.\n\nIt's like watching a biologist argue for creationism. Just tragic.","Evil? Lol. \n\nI believe that we should have compassion for all people. Just because someone has a \"disorder\" or is outside of normal range doesn't mean they deserve to be treated differently. \n\nBut believing that it is normal to have other than XX or XY is delusional. ","Evil never believes it is evil.","[deleted]","That's one of those things that really depends on life experience. Where I live now, I could probably send my 4 year old into the women's restroom and not have an issue. Where I grew up though, I would probably take teenagers with me into the bathroom if the need to use a public bathroom was really forced upon me the parent. Big places have family bathrooms specifically to deal with situations like that, but it's still a huge problem depending on where you live. \n\nIMO it speaks to how stupid gender-based bathrooms are in the first place. Privacy from adults of the opposite sex is a metric beyond stupid for splitting bathrooms up. We need individual bathrooms - not stalls, complete bathrooms. People are going to say that it's an undue cost on businesses to drop bathrooms in, but that same argument would conclude that gender-based bathrooms are an undue cost. ","You're calling it binary. I'm saying there are many variants. How is that binary?","I'm saying it's not a \"variant\" if we call it a disorder. Why isn't having an XX/XY set called anything other than \"male or female\"? Oh yeah because that's how we biologically work.","[deleted]","I think that fight should be picked with people that design shitty, zero privacy bathroom stalls, not people trying to use the bathroom in peace. I can see why it would make for an uncomfortable bathroom experience all the same.","That's something I don't usually think of, as a lesbian. I guess in that case it's kind of a latter of two evils kind of thing; separate bathrooms requiring us to strictly define who can use which one, or a unisex bathroom where the two sexes are mingled.","I don't see why anything needs to be \"strictly defined.\" Trans individuals have been using the bathroom that corresponds with their identity for a while. It's only now an issue during a major election cycle. Surprise.","Yeah, but is that really the be-all and end-all of it? That seems like a really specific thing to cling to try and justify your opinions.","You gunna genetically test everyone before they take a piss?\n","[deleted]","Yet it still scientifically classifies someone as male or female because biology is a real science and \"gender fluidity\" is nonsense.","Whhat...what?

She'd always been pretty, but when she got back, she was suddenly *hot* -- there's a fucking difference.  Like, the difference between \"Oh, that's nice\" and \"I would absolutely, hands-down hit that if I weren't dating your sister\".\n\nAnyway, I try to be a pretty upstanding person, so I told my girlfriend this about it, pretty much along the lines of, \"Uh, hey, fyi, your sister's, like, uncomfortably hot, now.  If it seems like I'm ever actively avoiding looking at/contact with her, well, it's because I am.\"  In a nutshell, I *immediately* noped the fuck away from that, and I let girlfriend know so we didn't end up in an awkward situation out of ignorance (e.g. previously, the three of us had gone on trips where I was often alone with said sister, and it wasn't an issue then because she wasn't hot.  Now she was hot.).\n\nAt the time, girlfriend and I had only just started getting into any sort of kink.  She was new to everything and still figuring out what she liked.  So, in that moment after I've told her this, she goes through this intense inner struggle.  It's written all over her face, that she's *intensely* uncomfortable with something, and not exactly with what I've just said.\n\nShe figures it out in a few seconds (which feel like a few hours) and looks up and me and says, \"Okay.  I'm glad you think so.\"\n\nNow, I didn't know what to expect, but that sure as shit was not it.  \"You're an asshole\", sure.  \"Thanks for letting me know, I'll try to keep that in mind\", got it.  \"I can't blame you\", right on.  But \"I'm glad you think so\"?  What in the *fuck* is that?\n\nThe rest of the day goes by, and it doesn't come up again until that night, after everyone else has gone to bed and it's just me and girlfriend still up, watching a movie.  She leans over to me, takes my junk in her hand, and says, again: \"I'm glad you think [sister's name] is hot\".\n\nShe then proceeds to jerk me off while telling me, in excruciating detail, exactly what she thinks her stunning little sister would be like in bed.\n\nSince then, it's turned into a huge kink for both of us.  Girlfriend's gotten off to me calling her her sister's name in bed.  I cannot think about her sister without my head immediately going into the gutter.\n\nAnd sister still has no idea.\n\nIt's been an interesting year.","Wow man, you stepped out on that ledge and your girlfriend's pool of infinite kinky depth saved your ass.

But fast forward an hour later, and he's choking me while we're going at it and IT WAS SO INCREDIBLY HOT. I was into it. After that he tied me up, blind folded me and choked me and pretend-raped me and it was the most fun sexual encounter I've ever had.

He came behind me and flicked out his switchblade  (it wasn't uncommon to be carrying one in our tech theatre class).

Japan does this sub genre very well and I've basically conditioned myself to not even notice the pixelation anymore. There's a big demand for this type of porn in Japan thanks to their aging population. Europe makes this kind stuff too, with sites like Oldje and Grandpasfuckteens, but the girls are incredibly hit or miss. Most of the girls have that depressing, downtrodden Eastern European look to them that kills boners. Oldje is OK, but their camera work is beyond horrible.

I think I like it cause it seems like the most perverse and disgusting thing ever for the girls to subject themselves to. The Japanese porn stars are hot as hell and even french kiss the grandpas as they fuck, and the best part is the grandpas get to cum inside the girls. Porn is deemed degrading by society in general, but this just goes the extra mile.

Please don't do things that make you uncomfortable to please someone else - that is the real unhealthy relationship. You deserve to feel equally comfortable and pleasured","&gt;you deserve to feel equally comfortable and pleasured.\n\nOp has stated its not her situation, but for the sake of discussion, would you say that the BF does too? What if he doesn't feel satisfied sexually? If the rest of the relationship is great (and to get back on topic) but the fetish is left unfulfilled, what do you do? From the BF prospective, make the relationship work in the absence of sexual fulfillment? I suggest you take up the things you liked from this relationship and find it with someone else who also fulfills your sexual fetish. Be, as you said, equally comfortable and pleasured. Happiness isn't \"with a person\", it's a state of mind. Sometimes one person feels that happiness and a little hurt the other doesn't. Especially if the other person doesn't feel that happiness due to sexual related issues. That makes the happy person self conscious and they retract as a defense mechanism. Now resentment comes into play. You now have two unhappy people in a relationship making it work because everything else was fine but the lack of sex has put a gray shadow on everything. It's a matter of \"when\" the relationship is officially over at that point because all that's left is a shell of one. I can't imagine the dynamic of throwing children into the mix. Go the extra mile for the ones you love, people. Be safe though and don't do anything you'll regret. If it's to that point, start weighing your options in terms of relationships.","Yo. OP's boyfriend here. I'll be honest, do I wish she was more of an exhibitionist? Yeah I do. There's a lot of things of that ilk I'd like to do with her, but as she said we're sexually compatible in other ways. I never went into this relationship expecting us to be on board 100% with everything the other is into. I'm very satisfied with both our sex life and the non-sexual parts of our relationship. She knew I was an exhibitionist early on in our relationship and I knew she wasn't one. It's not a dealbreaker for me.","Hell yeah. I'm glad to hear that. I have faith you're the real OP's BF...\n\nSince I have you... If it was a very big deal to you, would you continue the relationship or seek a new partner that satisfies that want?","Honestly that's a good question. I'd like to think that if I wasn't feeling sexually satisfied with my partner at all even if I really liked them I'd talk to them first, see if we could come up with a solution first. I'm not above seeing one of those sex counselors if the need ever arose but if we couldn't come to a compromise, then I would probably break it off as amicably as I could but not before thinking long and hard on it.","And in a much more empathetic nutshell that's my downvoted arguments.","The word equally implies at least two parties, so yes, I was saying the boyfriend also deserves to be comfortable and pleasured.\n\nThat said, this whole slippery slope argument of yours doesn't fly. An unfulfilled fetish doesn't immediately throw a person into deep depression - if it does, you should consider professional help. If your fetish involved demeaning and humiliating the other party, don't think that just because you're in a relationship, they should be bowing down and fulfilling your every whim. In that scenario, you're making them feel bad just to make yourself feel better. You're telling me that's what a healthy and equal relationship looks like? There has to be compromise, you don't get to have everything you want at others expense.\n\nTreat people like people, and I think you'll find your relationships go a lot better.","I don't think you need to compromise on your sexuality or sexual fetishes. I believe you should endorse the hedonism inside you and explore your desires. If the person you're dating isn't into it, I agree... It's wrong to expect them to do it.

She kept saying something to the effect of \"why aren't you fighting back?\" And I responded something along the lines of, \"why would I fight back? This is fun.\" I loved every bit of it.\n\nMy friends in the class saw the ordeal and were making fun of me afterward for getting beat up by a girl, but I didn't care because whatever that girl did was awesome.\n\nFurthermore, before I was sexually conscious, I would fantasize about getting beat up...like, I would white-knight it and run into fight to save a girl I fancied, but I would always get my ass kicked in the fantasy and I would gain the respect of the girl. \n\nWelp. That actually explains a lot. Thanks, reddit. ","I think you laughed harder than I ever have in my life, got to say sorry about the fetus but can't say I'm not jealous.","No one will probably see this but here goes, an explanation for a kink that crops up regularly on reddit but is rarely understood.  \n\nI was probably 6-8 years old, and my little brother was going through potty training. Mine had been nbd, I literally went up to my mom one day and said \"no more diapers!\" and that was it. My brother required a lot more encouragement; we had a chart on the bathroom door, he got stickers when he used the potty, if he was good they would rent him a VHS, the works. I guess I must have been wishing I could be the center of attention, or was feeling neglected or something, but I started stealing his diapers from the closet and wearing them in secret. Eventually I got caught and got in trouble/quit, but I've had a thing for diapers ever since. The soft texture, the puffy feeling, the cute prints they now make for adult sizes, all of it. I have no regrets about it most days, it's harmless and fun, and doesn't seem like it's a danger to anyone.","~~Edwin~~  Erdogan ","Not a kink, but a significant aspect of my sexuality that I discovered very suddenly. Many, many years ago, before I even had a mature and developed understanding of sexual orientation and before I knew myself well enough for the thought to even occur to me that I might not be heterosexual, I had a friend who would hang out at my house on the weekends. He'd usually spend a night or two before going home and we'd be up all night playing video games and talking about all sorts of stupid shit you'd expect two boys in their early teens to talk about.\n\nOne night we were doing just that, and I don't even remember what we were talking about, but at one point he got it into his head that the next time I looked over at him it would be hilarious to flash me. So he did. My gut reaction was what you'd expect: look away super fast, laugh, \"what the fuck dude c'mon,\" and that's how I reacted the next couple times he did it. But after a point he wasn't laughing as hard and I wasn't turning away and suddenly we were just laying there, nervously giggling, while his dick was out, hard as a rock, and my eyes were fixated on it. I felt a strange sort of compulsion I'd never experienced before and after a moment I found myself nervously reaching for it and asking him if I could touch it.\n\nI awkwardly ran my hands up, down, and all around it, basically exploring it like I'd never seen a penis before, and after several seconds I grasped it, looked at him, and said I wanted to suck on it. And I did, with gusto. From that night on, every time he came over we'd wait until everyone went to sleep and I would just blow him over and over and over again until my jaw was completely dead and he couldn't cum anymore.\n\nSo that was how I was very suddenly confronted with the idea that I might not be straight and also how I learned that I fucking love sucking dick.\n\n**tl;dr** Got some surprise dick that answered questions I never knew I had","In OP's dreams, maybe.","WTF","ok so, what do you do with them though?

She was a year older, and we did everything together, I mean literally everything, I had maybe one or two other friends. We played video games, rode bikes out in the woods, went to the movies a lot, adventured around town causing all sorts of mischief, so just teenager things but we were always together. \n\nOne day in the summer, we were having a little get-together with other people and having fun with a rope swing that went over a big lake. My sister had worn a bikini, and at that point, somehow I had never seen her partially clothed. I caught myself staring at her a couple of times, feeling shameful of what I was thinking about my sister, but I realized, that as long as nothing comes of it, it's alright. My hormonal 16y/o brain just couldn't drop it and I couldn't think of my sister in a non-sexual way anymore, I felt disgusting and I would avoid her sometimes, even though we used to be best friends. \n\nNow that I'm 25, I still think about it sometimes, and I browse incest porn pretty heavily.

We were doing a nature hike kind of deal, which we had instead of recess once a week. We were about 30 mins into the trail and about to turn back when one of the girls I had a crush on, older than me, maybe 13, told the guide that she had to pee. Guide couldn't let her go into the trees alone which would be illegal, couldn't go with her because then the group would be alone which would be illegal, so she just tried to hurry us back to the school.\n\nAs we were walking, the girl started gasping periodically and stopping to hold herself.

I was aware of search history and knew I couldn't search for this kinda thing without my parents seeing it, so I worked out how to use IE \"inPrivate\" browsing (basically incognito, we didn't have Chrome for a number of irrelevant reasons).\n\nWhen I had the time, I searched \"why am I turned on by feet?\" and so many pages came up about this \"foot fetish thing\". I image searched \"girl's feet\", \"barefoot women\" etc. and never felt more turned on. It was insane, something I never felt before...I still felt very insecure about it but it helped, and I still do feel insecure now at 20 years old!\n\nSo I mentioned that there were other occasions too. This one wasn't really a moment of realisation but rather a long period of time where I caught myself in situations and questioned them. From around age 10 I started looking at girl's feet, girls my age and women. Girls wearing flats without socks gave me and still give me the biggest turn-ons, especially girls barefoot in public. I remember the end of primary school dance thing (kinda like a kid's disco), this  crush I had took off her shoes to dance and I was in a sweat the whole night. I always thought I was incredibly screwed up...puberty was a rocky road!\n\nLastly, the earliest memory I have is more of an \"in hindsight realisation\". Back in Nursery, we had a PE thing every week. We had to go into the hall, set up the mats and bring in all of the sports stuff, then take off our shoes and socks, which always made me really uncomfortable; to me it was like the equivalent of having to get out my genitals in public because of how I saw feet, with my undeveloped child brain.\n\nSo that's how I realised it! I'm happy to answer any questions about it if anyone has any, I'm more at peace with it now and have a GF who's awesome enough to let me indulge in exchange for foot rubs and all that stuff.","[Example 1](http://stuff.twoday.net/stories/1973384/)\n\n[Example 2](http://stuff.twoday.net/stories/1023961/)","Of course it's German.

Another girl liked it a bit rough so after I pulled out and came on her face I suddenly smacked her... so hard that the cum went flying off her face and onto the wall. We immediately had sex again. Another girl was nearly 6 foot and well built (did track and field at uni). We would wrestle around, rougher and rougher, which would lead to me putting her legs over my shoulders, pinning her down, slipping my hands around her neck as my forearms cut into her shoulders, and roughly chokefucking her to the edge of consciousness. One time she started struggling really hard and trying to yell, which made me stop and freak out until I saw the wry smile on her face. Then it was on. Oh the bruises after that, like little buttons I could push when we were out to remind her... I moved away shortly after that, before we had a chance to really experiment, and have never found another girl that could take me being that rough.","I got so lucky, as we became more comfortable with each other and settled into the \"what works for us\" of our sexualities in our marriage, my husband and I trade porn links with the daddy roleplay.\n\nIt's so weird though how totally utterly mutually exclusive the sex part is from say, the fact that I'm a woman in my 30s and I am a requisite Daddy's Girl. My dad is my other best friend, but fucking EWWWW in regards to a remotely sexual thought about him.\n\nIf my husband pops up behind me one day and says, \"Daddy needs you to be a very good girl today, or you'll get a spanking, so don't be naughty,\" that's instant Sploosh. ","Weird question- but do you ever think that subconsciously you DO want to fuck your dad on some level- purely subconsciously- and that's why you're into this? ","Honestly, I never, ever do. Ever. It makes me physically ill to even think about it.\n\nHowever, I think the fantasy in and of itself comes from being molested by manipultive teenage boys when I was four years old. I \"get off\" on the being innocent and being manipulated into something dirty and doing what someone in a position of authority or someone older is telling me to do. It's very much psychological. The daddy/daughter dynamic is my favorite of these fantasies, but I am into dialogue-heavy older/younger fantasies as well; porns I suppose that start with a teacher, or the boss of a babysitter, or a male parental figure convincing or tricking young women into doing something that is taboo in nature.\n\nI suppose that's the most simplistic way of looking at it, to try and justify it, because it's very much a shameful thing to think about (for me anyways) otherwise. \n\nI hope that answers your question. I realize many people develop fetishes/kinks/fantasies for many different reasons; I feel that mine is very much a psychological coping mechanism. For example, I was in therapy as a teenager because a fellow student, male, put his arm around me; I didn't know why but I started screaming bloody murder and sobbing when he touched me. I hadn't really ever run into being touched by another person (I come from a very unaffectionate family). I became despondent and depressed and knew something was wrong with me, so I brought it up in therapy. I agreed to a hypnotist session and at the age of 16, I recalled everything in detail after a few sessions.\n\nI brought it up to my father a few years later. He admitted that he protected my mother for being drunk, passing out repeatedly, and allowing the neighborhood boys to play with us unsupervised, when most of the abuse took place. These older boys (14/16 at the time) also molested my older brother. These kids were also the children of a very wealthy member of our community. My dad threatened the father of the boys and forbade them from going to the property, but he never informed the police. So I had a lot of therapy dealing with my parents failure to protect my brother and I from that abuse as well. \n\nIt goes really, very deep. It's difficult to articulate it but my sexual attraction to the scenario is most definitely a psychological manifestation of events that caused PTSD in myself as an adult.\n\n.....that was long-winded and with no thesis whatsoever. My apologies.","Actually, and I understand you were making a joke, but Chinese algebra is of course no harder (and uses the same symbols as) algebra in any other language or culture.

","So this is probably one of the weirder ones, but this is something that I've looked back on and have thought was very interesting in how it developed so I'll post it.\n\nSo back when I was really young, I forget how old, my parents were watching Honey I Shrunk the Kids. But that movie fucking terrified me from the sound of it, so I refused to watch it, and I closed the door to my room and stayed there because I was just not about it. I low key kept listening though because I was mildly interested in it despite it scaring the shit out of me. I think this kind of set the stage for the fetish for whatever reason. I can't remember if I was actually turned on by the thought of being shrunk at all or not at that time, but I'm pretty sure I was extremely fascinated by the idea of it, but at the same time the thought still terrified me. However as I grew up, whenever there were TV show episodes that involved shrinking in any way, they were always my favorites, and I'd watch them over and over. I didn't even realize I had a thing for it but I do remember getting turned on by it at times later on (despite not having an actual understanding of what being turned on entailed).\n\nSo growing up, around middle school or so if I remember correctly, I still didn't realize I had a thing for it, but I was doing a google search for a video game (Zelda: Ocarina of Time, if you were wondering) and in the process of the search I saw a picture of one of the female characters from the game as a giant holding a tiny Link (the main character) in her hands. And it totally caught my attention. Like it didn't immediately turn me on or anything but it got me interested and I wanted to see what the deal was - why this picture exists and where it came from. So I end up following the link and finding a site that was dedicated to giantess pictures that was focused primarily around videogames. I remember just going around there and looking at all of these pictures and being totally fascinated while simultaneously getting a raging boner.\n\nWhat caught my attention the most was the story about why the guy who made the site did make the site, because his story sounded so similar to mine, except he understood his feelings a lot better than I did and he embraced it. It just kind of clicked; \"oh, I am into the idea of being shrunk and interacting with normal-sized girls.\" And while I did not immediately understand the sexual feelings due to my age at the time, it became a part of my life from that point on. I'd just keep looking for giantess pictures and videos and saving them.\n\nThrowaway account because I am still self-conscious about this even though I know I probably shouldn't be. Had an ex-gf who I later found out would laugh about it with a bunch of mutual friends and friends of her own behind my back after I told her. Not fun. But at the same time I've been under the impression that this is a lot more common than I used to think it was. Gives me hope that someday there will be people that really nail it with the video production because there has been an extreme drought of high-quality giantess content lately :-(","god damn, made me cough up my bong hit there.

I remember this one thought that crossed my mind when I was watching the Rugrats movie.....(no, it's not anything to do with kids. Don't worry)...that it would be nice to have a little sister. Not just because I was a bored only child, I seemed to want a little sister (like 1 or 2 years younger), for........ other purposes. And it's continued to followed me even today. I've never been in a relationship long enough to ask for that particular role play, and I don't think I ever could either.

","In early middle school I was looking up p0rn (for whatever reason, I guess) and something took me totally by surprise. Animal characters, sexualized (this was after I found the comic VGCats and casually read it time to time). It perplexed me more at first more than anything, I felt like I was in a state of disbelief for a few days at least. When I became brave enough again I decided to explore it a bit (turns out they're called 'furries') and was opened up to a whole new world of fantasy and kinks. I found some great artists, people, etc. A whole community of people were behind the scenes and I soon found out it was so much more than just a kink factory. All in all I am now a semi-famous furry artist who gets their income from drawing the exact thing that sparked my artistic pursuit and I go to school for animation. I've never been happier, and I'm not exaggerating it. ","I'm going to regret not making an alt account for this, but here we go.\n\nWhen I was in...hmm, 6th, 7th grade?...I was reading one of the Percy Jackson books. I think it was Sea of Monsters. But there's this one part where some of the characters were turned into guinea pigs, of all things, by some goddess or another who hated men, and the female character stayed human.\n\nAnd this is when I discovered that I am very much okay with giant women. Didn't think giantesses and being shrunk would be my thing, but hey. So far, the hottest idea for me is a shrunken woman trapped in the middle of a blowjob, then being swallowed with the cum. No hard digestion, of course. Gore is a huge turnoff.\n\nSadly, unlike basically every other kink on here, this one will almost definitely never happen, even in VR. But anywho, I've never told anyone this at all, ever, so it feels good to final get it out there.\n\nEdit: Just noticed OP's username. I AM NOT ALONE, FUCK YEAH.","\"Swallowed\" as in cock vore?

Whenever there was a character growing bigger in a TV show or film it's always peaked my interest, and episodes where things were growing gigantic were always my favourite. ","NO, DAMIAN, I HAVE TO SAVE GOTHAM. ","I learned I was into spanking very early in life. Pretty much any spanko will tell you the same thing here. Just hearing the word spanking or watching cartoons that had spanking in it like [tom and jerry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gqBR5mETOo). Something in your mind would click that this was interesting. You know you shouldn't like this but you are intrigued. Spankings are bad things not good things.\n\nI remember specifically when I was 7 laying in bed thinking of girls in my class who I thought were pretty and who I would want to spank. Usually over their panties. I was 7 didn't know anything about sex and wasn't interest in having sex just wanted to spank girls. I remember laying in bed thinking about this and thinking I wet the best as laid there holding my penis. Not actually masturbating or anything just knowing it felt good and having a little come out getting wet.\n  \nAs the years went on the interest was still there in the back of my mind. We would read books in class and in that book a kid might get a spanking and I would get a little aroused. I would start looking the word up in the dictionary(every spanko does this). 11  was the first time I started masturbating to spanking. I didn't know spanking porn was a real thing so I was still looking for cartoons, stories of people being spanked, looking on ebay at spanking paddles and weird stuff like that. Around 2006 when I was 16 the golden age of spanking porn really started. Prior to this there wasn't a ton of good content online and it was really low quality. Some time around 14-16 I started to realize my other fetish which was panties.  I didn't have anyone to spank so I would spank myself. I like to be spanked a little bit but mainly I wanted to spank girls. Girls wore panties and I would find a pair of panties to wear and spank myself wearing panties.  I developed a fetish for panties probably some time before this but it definitely helped.  As for the panty fetish I think that is pretty self explanatory. We sexualize underwear so much we can't show naked people on TV so panties=female=sexy. I love seeing panty lines, panties or a thong riding over pants, a skirt blowing up and revealing panties. Any of that is instant boner. \n\nGoing back to spanking. I love watching videos of spanking where the girl is spanked over her panties. Spanking on the bare is nice but there are so many different types of cute panties it is both my fetishes in one spot. The spanking can finish on the bare but the panties is where it is at for me. \n\nOver time I have grown to like harder spankings. Only spankings on the butt though. No hitting anywhere else. I was never a big fan of tears but that is starting to turn me on more. Mostly because that means it is an actual spanking and no just a weak playful spanking that is meant for the main stream porn audience. I don't really like bondage unless it is still related to spanking. no tying up with rope or ball gag stuff. No leather clothes. Just domestic type spanking. \nAround 18 I started joining chat rooms and social media sites with other like minded people. I met a girl who really convinced me to let go of the idea that it is wrong to have a fetish and never turned back. I have spanked my girlfriends on occasion but they were never that into the fetish. I always made it as clear as possible what I was looking for and light taps on the ass during sex is not a spanking fetish. The first real spanking I gave was around 21 to some girl an hour and a half away. She drove out a few times and I gave her several spankings in total. Massive turn on but I wasn't interested in her sexually just into spanking her. We both got what we wanted and would go our separate ways. \n\nThe hardest thing about fetishes is finding someone who shares the same one at the same level you do. It is the same for all acts of sex but as it was something that has been in my head since I was a child it has become very important to me as a person.\n\non another note I don't advocate spanking children but that is your own thing to do.  Plenty of people in the fetish were spanked as children and others not(I was not). Ratio feels like 70-30 maybe 60-40. I don't get off on watching children get spanked. I am into women my own age. Even 18 year olds start to feel a little young after awhile. I enjoy spanking cartoons and drawings people have made and posted online. I think that takes me back to where my fetish first began but I like seeing and doing the real thing more.\n\nI think that is everything. Hope that answers your question. I know I like to know more than just the simple \"spanking fetish at age 7 from cartoons\"","That's two kinks in one huh? He shouldn't have done it to someone at 14 though...","Maybe not but he wasn't much older than me. Maybe 16 ","I'm sure I could get into foot fetish.

","Ahh, the *rusty foot fondle.*","Trusty\n\nFTFY 😁😁","Heh, I was making a joke based on your typo (\"shit there for hours\"), combining it with *rusty trombone*. Now that I think of it, *foot steamer* works better. :P","Yeah I enjoy massaging girls' feet, but I've never done anything inherently sexual. I definitely understand the appeal though.","...yet.","There's good stuff out there, but I can understand how some of it is off putting.

The posters are there are pretty chill. ","That's interesting to hear...I would say it was about the same for me but I remember being curious super early. After that it just escalated from seeing porn and whatnot. First feet, then socks which turn out to be the main thing, then tickling/tickle torture and some bondage.

","Examples??? :)","Ok, so stuff like, \"Ohhh don't touch me there...\" or \"that hurts, please stop\" or \"do you like my pussy daddy?\" which leads to \"Oh daddy please cum in my pussy daddy\" . \n\nUnfortunately, she was a fucking psychopath in and out of bed.

I later found out I like Nekomimis in underwear(Especially black underwear).","It is hard to say for sure.  I have a number of different fetishes, and they all had signs of being there pretty early on.  As I look back on my childhood, some of my fetishes seem to have been there for as long as I can remember.  I remember being fascinated by bloody descriptions of people dying in books that I read.  When I watched horror movies, I couldn't stand suspense, but I never had problems with scenes of the monster actually attacking.  With more subtle stuff, I always took easily to the idea of people who had a ridged command structure and would never dare to go against it.  I also remember the first porn I ever used was a National Geographic with a pregnant woman on the cover.  It didn't help that I was also a late bloomer, so while my peers were off learning what boobs were, I was just like \"Don't care.  I'm going to go watch vampires eat the shit out of some people before being killed by a bubbly violent woman.\"\n\nI do remember the moment that I realized that my tastes were atypical.  In high school, I had gotten used to everyone else being more knowledgeable about sex than me (due to the late bloomer thing) and simply assumed that anything I knew was common knowledge.  One day, I was reading over a friends shoulder while he was looking at some LolCats.  One of them was a cat tangled up in some wires with the caption \"HALP! I FORGET SAFEWORD!\"  I had a nice chuckle about it and moved on, but he was really confused and asked what a safeword was.  At that moment, I realized that I had diverged at some point from not being knowledgeable about sexual matters to being knowledgeable about specialized sexual matters.\n\nActually figuring out what all of my kinks are has been a bit of an odd experience.  Usually, the revelation is less of a \"Oh, this is what I am into.\" and more \"Oh, other people aren't into this.\"  The most jarring of these revelations has been how other people perceive muscles.  Apparently most people find them very masculine and my idea that one can be both feminine and ripped doesn't make sense to people.","which region is pound town in again?","Good thing god doesn't care if you get fucked in the ass.

I'm kind of jealous, I'd totally cover my house with them ","Nuuu, I don't want any naughty parts in my toys D:","I'm guessing OP is a macrophile too? \n\nI don't know what triggered it but honestly I've had a kink for tall women and giantesses ever since I can remember, like from kindergarten onwards. \n\nI remember being really excited at an episode of TMNT where one of the female characters grows into a giantess. I was also really excited when a preview for \"Attack of the 50ft Woman\" came on a TV station, and I remember watching it and playing with my balls because I was too young to have had an erection yet (I was like, 7 or 8?). A friend of mine said her bondage kink came from Aladdin II, where Jafar ties up Jasmine, so it's funny how big an impact media can have. \n\nAnyways, even as a tyke I'd constantly have fantasies imagining women I knew (baby sitters, teachers, relatives, other girls from school or the neighborhood) growing bigger or being giantesses.\n\nMy corresponding kink for growth really started to take hold in middle school, around when girls got their growth spurts. I became excited when one would turn out to grow taller than me. I also got disappointed when, as the years passed, I surpassed a couple. I was so afraid of being tall that I used to actually sneak caffeine and diet coke, avoid milk, and try to deprive myself of sleep so I wouldn't grow too much (thankfully I ended up around 5'6\" so my tall girl fantasies are relatively easy to live out).\n\nBreast expansion and lactation, muscle growth, and bimbofication were off shoots of growth/transformation fantasies. From there I stumbled into Dom/Daddy Dom stuff because it was able to incorporate these fetishes through my \"control\" of a girl (dress like this, take these herbs to make your breasts fuller, do these stretches so you stand taller, here's what you eat and your exercise routine, etc). But at the end of the day the root of all of it was the size and growth obsession. \n\nMy macrophilia hasn't waned at all, although now I prefer mere \"exceptionally tall\" women to mega, city crushing giantesses. It's been such an obsession of mine that I actually devote a ton of time and resources to the study of auxology  (human growth) in the hopes that someday I can make my fantasies a reality. For now though, I generally date/play with women who are over 6' (preferably 6'3\" and up) and they're either cool with it or outright share the fantasy. It's really rare for me to get turned on by a woman who's under 5'7\".\n\nLast thing to note: lots of giantess fans have a submissive side. I don't, at all. I always viewed myself as the one conquering the giantess or having her fall for me. Even today, when I'm lying in bed with a girl with legs as long as my body or have her on my arm as we walk down the street, I get this overwhelming sense of validation and accomplishment. I feel like a man who's tamed a lioness. \n\n","Dude, you typed a heck of a lot here. Thank you.","I mean as you can tell it's something really important to me and a big part of my life. Thanks for making a thread where I could express this. ","Hm. Interesting to hear that someone has a similar experience. \n\nI'm not really into macrophilia to the degree of giantesses crushing buildings per say, but the whole growth kink is appealing to me too. My childhood was pretty similar. When I was around 12, I remember one particular girl always loved to compare heights with me and tease that she was going to outgrow me. When she wore heels for graduation, for some reason it really excited me that she was about an inch or so taller. Since then, I've been really interested in height growth and comparisons, and also the offshoot fantasies you mentioned like muscle and breast growth. Even if its physically manipulating height such as putting on a pair of platform heels, it gets me goin.\n\nWhat exactly is Dom/Daddy Dom stuff though? Do you express it through online roleplaying or fiction or do you actually meet people that are willing to let you alter their routines?","Heels get me going if I'm right next to the girl, but the instant I look at them I get a bit disappointed knowing she's not \"really\" that tall. But I still like them for the general sexiness.\n\nDom refers to the Dominant in a Dominant/submissive relationship. BDSM is a huge, diverse field but in my case the dynamic was basically that I, the Dom, had a command and authority over the submissive. It ranges from everything like \"now get down on your knees and suck me off\" to \"you're not allowed to eat french fries because it's bad for you.\" \n\nEvery dynamic is different, but I am generally a loving dominant who likes to care for and foster my submissive and it comes from a confidence of knowing what's best for someone. This really gelled with girls who identify as \"littles,\" or something close to that, so they would basically start calling me Daddy and asking me to do things like read stories to them, pet their hair, etc, in addition to normal kinky things. They also were the most enthusiastic about the transformation projects because they \"wanted to please Daddy.\" I'm sure there are a bunch of fucked up psychological reasons for why that dynamic manifests, but that's a longer topic. Tbh the Dom/sub thing on its own isn't even a big turn on for me sexually. I'm just good at it. \n\nAs for real life/online: I started out actually with a vanilla girl I had met on a dating site. She was considerably younger than me and less experienced in romance in general, so I slowly introduced the kinks to her. She was tall and curvy, I made her feel good about that, then introduced the idea of transformations which she took to as well in order to become sexier for me. We dated I'd say about a year and a half and in that time she grew a couple inches and a few cup sizes while losing weight. But she was much more into me emotionally than I was in to her and started to get resentful about the whole thing. \n\nSo now I just work with girls who are outright into the BE or GTS kink, and you find those online so they've been long distance. Basically, I supply the materials and guidance and they provide updates. I've worked with several girls, with mixed results. A couple have gotten impatient or aren't consistent enough (too busy, lazy, whatever) while others have grown quite a bit bigger up top from natural breast enhancement (\"NBE\") and one has successfully induced lactation (which was her goal). I'm starting to wind the boob stuff down though because I know it works and I want to reserve my time for height increase. \n\nSadly, for height growth I haven't had too much success with on other women because it takes so long to be noticeable and it requires a lot of dedication. Ideally, you want to find a girl with open growth plates, but that's usually not the case by age 18 (and even if it was, most women aren't interested in growing taller). So for those who have stopped growing, you gain inches via stretching to space out the vertebrae and joints and supplementing glucosamine to thicken the synovial fluid in between the joints. There are some other interesting options I want to explore (like using a low intensity pulsed ultra sound to simulate bone growth at the epiphysis) but that's something I want to do with someone in person. There's a 6'4\" girl I'm friends with who wants to become a huge breasted, lactating giantess, but her growth plates are closed, so I'm hoping some scientific break through comes forward. ","I was 11, started getting a pube stache, and had the sudden urge to get a poster of Cindy Crawford from the mall. She was in cut off shorts and getting up from the beach, showing lots of bum.

Neither of us could make sense of it, so we didn't thought much about it.\n\nA few years later we both started reading a new manga just fot the lolz named Nana to Kaoru.

When the dom made her pentagram knot (chest area), all the things that she was describing was exactly what I felt with the strechy tank top.\n\nI was extremely shy about it and it took me a long time to ask my bf to try a bit of bondage again, since we tried it before and it didn't have any effect in me.

'I want to keep my t-shirt on for 'X' reason' or 'I was cooking with my shirt off and splashed myself, what an idiot I am!' etc.\n\nBut part of planning a session is sometimes accepting that you're going to have to cover up for a while afterwards and do a bit of self-care; have special burn dressings to hand (the 'wet' hydrocolloid ones make a lot of difference in my experience!), self-monitor healing well, have a plan in place in case you suspect infection, and so forth.\n\nOr negotiate play where the top or Dom(me) swaps the hot item for a very cold one at the last moment. With a blindfold, you really won't know.\n\nHonestly, if you're playing so heavily, so much, that your body is becoming a mess, perhaps it's time to ease up a touch.

They use the dull side of a scalpel for lots of pain/nerve tests in the hospital -- I had GBS a while back and when they did it it felt like they were slicing me open, it was awful.","I spend, or have spent rather, a lot of time with flesh and blades.

Reading through everyone's kinks made me realize where mine came from and how young I was when it started.  \n\n  So, I guess I was around 6 or 7 years old and I would go and visit my Grandmother fairly often, as I was the only grand kid that lived close.  *No, we are not getting that weird.*  Anyway, I would go over there at least once a week and sometimes more than that.  Now let me give you a little background on my Grandmother...my Grandmother was a very particular sort of woman; notice I call her Grandmother, not Nanna or Grandma...it was Grandmother.  She was a very, \"Everything has a place and every place has a thing\" kind of woman...very organized and it didn't matter if she was going to the grocery store, if she was going out to a restaurant, or just out to the front of the yard to get the paper, she was always dressed to the nines.  Her hair was fixed and she was dressed from head to toe.  \n\nShe lived in a three bedroom house, by herself, and in each bedroom, there was a closet.  One closet was filled with clothes and the other 2 were filled from top to bottom with shoes.  The shoes were still all in the boxes that they were purchased in.  She wore them, but so that they stacked nice and it looked tidy, they were all in their original shoe boxes.  I used to spend hours taking those shoes out of the boxes and admiring them, because they got polished and cleaned before being put away every time she wore them.  There were shoes of every style and every color of the rainbow.  They were beautiful and luxurious and at the time I guess I didnt realize it, but they were also sexy.  Some had costume jewelry stones set in the heel and on the toes.  I was in heaven taking those shoes out of the boxes, looking at them, and putting them away...only to grab another box to see what delights were in the next box.  \n\nNow, on the inside door of my favorite shoe closet was her stockings and garter belts.  I dont think she ever wore them, because she just used to wear knee highs from the time I knew her until she passed away, but \"there is no sense in throwing away something that is perfectly good, even if you dont use it that often\".  Anyway, these stocking, which she never wore and some of them must have been dated back to the 40s, were so soft and so pretty.  There ones that had lines going up the back.  There were ones had flowers on the toes and at the tops in delicate lace and were so silky and smooth.  I used to rub them on the back of my hands and on my neck and face and it would feel so good.\n\nNow, Im am such a sucker for women in good looking sexy shoes, especially ones that look very \"old school\" or \"rockabilly\" and its invariably the first thing I look at when I see a woman.  I find that style on women so appealing and so super sexy.  Lord help me if I can tell if they have on thigh high stockings and a garter belt.  \n\nAs a twist of fate, unfortunately, my wife cant wear high heals more than about one inch because of a serious ankle injury that caused her to have to have a steel bracket and like 13 screws in her ankle and as a double twist of irony, she is just not interested in wearing stockings or finds the rockabilly look just \"not her\".","Not sure if we're talking about a human...

I got rock hard. Look she gave me for that in shower (which I , probably wrongly, interpreted as \"naughty boy\") made me even harder. It sent pulse down my body to my twitching penis. \n\nIt was that glorious \"I'm so dizzy I just need to cum hard and will do anything to be given an orgasm\" subby moment. I was drunk on my libido like they say girls are \"drunk on cock\".\n\nOutside of toilet-shower room (like normal house bathroom, she was dressed ofc outside and me in the shower cabin) were beds with female patients, my peers. That turned me on even more. Just casual eye contact with those girls when going out with a nurse. One of them, in late teen years, was nice to me (jumped with bandaged leg to open door for toilet to me, etc.) I included that into my stupid fantasy.\n\n Day after that I fapped and came like never before to that memory. Nearly had an heart attack. I fantasized that nurse held shower head a bit too long on my crotch in order to tease my erection (when in fact she held it just for a second.) I wanted her to edge me and choke me (breath play) or just be verbally dominant( when controlling my orgasms let's say).Also! Fingers down my throat!  Then I constructed a fantasy where she ordered me to bend over in front of those girls outside and stimulated my prostate while they laughed/cheered/fapped.\n\nSo I'm into being dominated by women and men alike. Also into power play (psychological dirty talk) and edging, BDSM. I want to be treated like submissive girls like to be treated (those dirty talk that sub girl get instantly wet gets me instantly hard and interested in my prostate). I would like to be bratty than taken down. \n\nIf I were a orphan, I would maybe go in porn industry (KINK.com!) Being filmed and ordered on camera is also my fetish, much more than desperate for money life choice. Or being paid (or not) for live sex dungeon shows that won't be filmed! Or just to be high fashion escort/hustler.\n\nOr just having cybersex, dirty talk with anon Dom where I send him pic and he describes inventive way to dominate me. Which I did in fact do and that confirmed that I am a sub-slut.\n\nMy twink looks (no real muscle) probably strengthen that notion that it's logical to be dominated by a stronger guy. I want to be house invaded by a two bald doms that will held me in headlock and force mo to fuck a flashlight, then edge me, then take my anal cherry.\n\nSry for my bad English.\n\nEDIT: Dozens of edits for addition to narrative and fixing my broken English.\n\n*(Stanley Kubrick's The Killers, AFFC Cersei vs Septas)\n\n  PMs to discuss or confront this more than welcome;) (I have more texts and verified pics for you if you have good dirty talk abilities).\n","I'm interested :3","In my average penis?

I understand your struggle. I don't have anything too rare or buried in the internet to share, but I'll be happy to share what I've got.\n\nhttp://tfgamessite.com/ - Pretty much my main go-to. I've already worked my way through all the games there (there is so many), but I check it every few days for updates. I HIGHLY recommend Corruption of Champions, Cursed, Press-Switch, The HERS Project, and basically anything by Kimberly Rex. Those are the well-known ones, but there is plenty of other great stuff on that site.\n\nhttps://tgcomics.com/ - Not so great nowadays, honestly. But there's some good free stuff you can see from before they switched to selling paid content.\n\nhttp://www.cyoc.net/ - The ship that launched a thousand fetishes. I haven't been here in years, but it was great when I was younger and had lower standards.\n\nhttps://8ch.net/tf/ - A nice board over on 8chan. You can burn through all their content in an afternoon, but I enjoyed it. There's a nice TG thread in there somewhere.\n\nhttps://8ch.net/d/ - On that note, this one also has some relevant threads, but /tf/ is a great deal better.\n\nhttp://arania.kamiki.net/ - An artist that specializes in TF content. There's not much TG here, mainly animal stuff, but I still really like this place for some reason.\n\nAnd that's all I've got. ","How do you even call this a list without [fictionmania](https://www.fictionmania.tv/) on it?","Somehow, never heard of it before now.

DeviantArt has a lot of stuff, but you need an account or to give them a claimed birthdate.

I can't explain it.","My story is similar.\n\nIt was one of the Chronicles of Narnia books I was reading. The Silver Chair, I think. It's been a very long time but there were these bracelets that ended up mind controlling some of the characters. I'm middle-school age, reading this part of the book while being driven home from the library, and suddenly sprouting wood with my whole family just a few feet away. I put the book down (sorry, incest/exhibition fans) until we got home, then re-read it alone dozens of times. Didn't really understand what was happening but I liked it.\n\n(I always liked the Mad Hatter stuff on Batman: The Animated Series, too, where he would mind control people with those cards. Didn't hurt that Alice was cute.)\n\nI grew up and spent a few years exploring the \"hypno\" porn stuff, but it eventually lost its shine for me. I liked situations where someone was driven to complete sluttiness* or rendered into an inanimate state, as nothing more but a toy to be fucked. But I never liked the (almost certainly fake) porn where girls would volunteer to be hypnotized, then basically just masturbate on the couch while some off-screen voice tells her weird shit about her clitoris until she cums. Eventually I lost interest, mostly just due to lack of new content.\n\nIt wasn't until I encountered all the weird transformation shit on 4chan and DeviantArt that things got good, again: bimboization, MtF transformation (willing or otherwise), transformation into a sex toy, contagious transformation, and just about everything else related - except for transformation into mundane stuff like broccoli or a wristwatch or (sorry, scat fans) a toilet. Whether the victim of transformation is myself, someone else, both of us, or maybe I'm the one transforming other people... so long as the end result is a slut or sex toy, especially a contagious slut or sex toy, I'm into it.\n\nAnd this new spark brought back my interest in mind control stuff, too.\n\nNot sure why Animorphs didn't get my motor running. (Sorry, furries.)\n\n---\n\n\\* *Spoiler alert: Porn flick \"Night of the Giving Head\" has a disease that targets the testes, and is spread via sperm. Once a woman has ingested infected sperm, she will become a cum zombie, a mindless creature that craves dick constantly. Every dick she sucks will then become infected, until the world is nothing but cum-hungry and somewhat-pallid sluts, and the men whose dicks they desperately suck. This movie gets me rock hard every time.*","if you dont thank me for finding porn of your exact kink than i'll be kinda upset\nhttp://www.tsumino.com/Book/Info/1240/1/human-lovers-committee","Well, that has a bit of everything, now does it?","You're going to shit when you see Tusk.

","I'm similar in that I'm turned on by transformation/gender-change/body-swap/inanimate/etc. Mine too; funnily enough ,was spurred on by a kids book(not magic tree house, though I do remember reading those).\n\nI'm in my mid 20's now and though I never considered the possibility of being gay, when all the transsexuals came out of the woodwork I do remember wondering if that was the root of my fetishes. I came to the conclusion it indeed was not, and that instead it is an extension of fantasies to be dominated. I've never dated a woman even approaching my height or stature, and am quite assertive in day-to-day life. When I finally had a girlfriend who wanted to try being dominant in bed it very much hit on the same fantasy that all the transformation stuff does. \n\nI think a bit too often people try too hard to play Freud and determine the origin of their sexual fetishes/fantasies/kinks. Some people's fetishes are centered around taking a norm to a new level, some are looking for an new experience, some an old one, and some for experiencing something in a different way.","Whoa, I had a similar obsession as a kid! This happened a LOT in cartoons and I can still remember them vividly: In TMNT this woman turned into a lizard, in Gummi Bears one of the gummi bears turned into a tree, and in the Aladdin series Jasmin was turned into a snake.

Not Gay, not queer, maybe a little furry, but yep, all TF stuff does it. Also, same about mind-control, and I have even less idea where that's from.\n\n\nI honestly suspect it has to do with not being fully happy with who I am on a mental level- I love to draw, but I have disgraphia. I love math, but I suck at algebra. I love concentrating on stuff, but I have severe ADHD to the point I can't listen to people for more than a couple seconds.

So hotel fun times after hours on business trips.\nShe had told me she wanted to try bondage and had never been tied up before. I'm a sailor and know my knots so I packed some soft nylon line with me on the next trip.\nI had her tied to the bed and stripped naked. Doing the usual stuff; making her call me Mr. Uptightywhitey while she sucked my dick, writing my name on her ass, things like that. But I wasn't really super into it and seeing her dumb self get into it was irritating somehow. And I had a whole weekend of this to get through.\nThen I ordered room service. \nShe started to get a wild look in her eyes as I was calling it in. What would I do? Would I let them in the room? Would I let them see her? Fuck her? Who would come? Did she want that? Was she really as cool as she imagined? She really couldn't move and I didn't say anything. I just gave her a smirk and went into the other room to pull my pants on. The next fifteen minutes were delicious. She would call for me occasionally but she forgot the \"mister\" and I didn't answer. I just let her stew in her juices.\nI have to admit when the knock came on the door my heart was in my chest too. There was enough room in the breezeway into the suite that I thought I could control them. But there was only about four steps they could get into the room before the corner and there she was, spread eagle and naked on the bed.\nThe room service guy was a tall, mid-forties Latino guy. Fit and thin and for a moment I considered it. But I let the exchange play out slow and easy. Asked him how his night was going. It was a little weird because I was clearly blocking him from coming all the way, but it added to the tension. We concluded and he said good night. I said \"Oh wait, I have something here you might like...\" He turned back, expectantly. I flipped him a twenty.\nBack in the room she was as wet and as ready as anyone had ever been. I saw her face and instantly got hard. I thrust my dick into her face and it was amazing. She just kept sucking it after I came and then through until I came again. \nAfter that I felt a warmth and protectiveness for her that I hadn't before. Her being under my power made me feel responsible and nurturing; like I was caring for a wounded animal. \nDon't get me wrong: she was still irritating but I liked fucking her like that. \n","Well I don't know why this isn't higher.

The guys were random men he vaguely knew that he'd promised could \"fuck a hot girl\" and as a result they were rough, unpleasant, and not very well groomed. But I was so horny I didn't even care. I fucked them all until I couldn't move anymore, and after that I knew this was what I wanted to do with my life. I'm seriously lucky I didn't catch anything from those guys other than a UTI.

In Temujin (Genghis Khan)'s story, the book portrayed how a competing clan raided Temujin's village and took Temujin prisoner (because he was the heir to the clan leader). To keep Temujin imprisoned, they chained his hands, and nailed the chains to a log of wood, and had Temujin carry the log behind his neck. He appears portrayed as chained to this log for about 4 cutscenes - he's sitting outside the tent while the competing clan holds a party celebrating their victory, then temujin hits the guard and runs away, then hides in the river while the enemy look for him.

","In Mexico, a passive man is the one that takes the D, and a submissive person is the kind that OP describes.","I think the opposite is true for most people. Being dominant goes against the instinct to be loving and respectful towards the other person. Most things done by the dominate would qualify as abuse without informed consent. It is emotionally draining to do that to another person if it is not what you are into.","This 1000x. I didn't really have the heart to tell my ex why slapping her around or that kind of stuff made me so exhausted.",":/","This is accurate for a lot of people who are just starting out with this kind of stuff. What you learn as you go along is that a) in a dominant/submissive dynamic, in most cases, the sub actually has all the power; the dom is only in charge superficially. And b) by being dominant, by slapping the other person around or tying them up, or whatever it is, you're giving them something they want, something they *need* in some cases.  And an important thing to remember is that doms don't have to be so aggressive and borderline violent as they're portrayed in pop culture.  I had a sub once who just wanted to be nurtured and taken care of essentially.  She wanted someone to be in charge because she liked the submissive headspace, because it means all your decisions are made for you. It's easy.\n\nEverybody should give this stuff a shot at some point in your life though.  If it's not you're thing, then that's cool, but man, if it is, there's a whole world that opens up. ","Ha what. Being in control is way harder.","I meant in the case when your partner does not really like it. For me it is enough if the partner is somewhat willing. If you want a dominant partner, this partner must be much more than willing. He/she must play an active role. That is much harder to find.","not to mention, one who knows the ins and outs of bdsm, the rules, the safety protocols","There's a difference between restraint and abuse.  I do not have a problem with being restrained safely. I do have a problem with women being degraded and called \"slut\", \"whore\" and things like that. Or being hit to the point where they are drawing blood and doing seriously painful things. I know about \"Safe, sane and consensual.\" I think women get degraded enough in society as it is, and I don't think calling a woman a slut or a whore, unless she specifically asks for it, is good. I am a straight woman. \n","Hell yeah it is. Just sitting there patiently waiting for them to do what was going so much for you. ","I can't be passive in bed . I can barely relax enough to get head, I had a girlfriend slap me a few times when she was riding me. It was the most unnattractive thing I've ever experienced, being dominated. I'm a big guy, probably some conditioning there as I'm usually treated as dominate.","Depends what your natural inclination is.","Yes, I'm harder when I'm in the passive role, compared to when I'm dominant.","I suck at being dominant.

I remember my dad asking about my horse in the box and I told him it was like spirit but I don't remember his reaction. Looking back I am so embarrassed and I hope my dad doesn't remember.

Well while I was playing I held the controller in my lap as I was sitting on the floor and I was wearing Umbros (soccer type shorts) and they were silk. The end of the controller handle kept going up and down my penis against the silk thus giving me a very pleasuring feeling. I had no idea what masturbation was at the time, but it felt good.... Really good. So, I paused the game, and got in my bed and started rubbing my hand up and down the shorts like the controller before me but this time I did it faster until I saw some clear stuff come out of the tip of my penis.

But one night all of my friends got off way earlier than usual so I decided to grab my very crappy laptop so I could go watch YouTube videos in bed. After clicking through a few videos I noticed an ad for a dating website on the side of the video, the girl in the picture had really huge boobs and after starring at it for a while a got an urge to rub my penis to it. It felt really awkward rubbing my penis so I went to my closet and grabbed one of my childhood stuffed animals, a goose, and I used that to rub against my penis. After some time my goose began to get less fuzzy and it had some raw spots on it, so I decided I'd fix that issue by cutting a hole in it and using the inside to masturbate instead. The cotton felt so good on my penis, it just drove me crazy.. My goose lasted about a year and a half before it became too loose to use... But as of now for masturbation I use a pocket pussy in a hole I cut into a stuffed animal moose, hence how I got my username. ","So is it the stuffed toys that you've got the thing for then?

There is so much rule 34 that it starts bleeding through the cracks of safe search. Otherwise you might end up with really damn weird dreams (or in my case sleep paralysis hallucinations *shudders*) and realize you are a closeted furry. I'm using a throwaway for reasons that will become obvious. \n\nIntro (skip if you want to get to the fuckeduptivity): I am a 19 year old man that is very familiar with a good deal of the strange shit on the Internet. However, my sexual tastes are very vanilla outside of the weirdness below (I am a non virgin). I must warn you, dear reader, that the shit you are about to subject your poor little eyeballs to is a 10 on the whatthefuckometer. This is approaching cumbox levels of WTF. Here is a teaser of what is in store bellow: An animated Disney character fucks me. Still here? Okay. Buckle up, dear reader.\n\nStory: To give you context, I have had sleep paralysis twice in my entire life. Once when I was eight (with no hallucinations) and the instance I am going to describe to you (with an incredibly realistic hallucination [felt COMPLETELY real]). I woke up in the middle of the night and realized I couldn't move anything but my eyes. I knew exactly what was happening, so I decided to go along for the ride. I felt a strong warm pressure on my chest as if someone was sitting on it. My vision adjusted to the dim lighting in my room (I leave my bathroom light on with the door cracked so I can see if I get up during the night). I saw what looked like the figure of a nude woman sitting on me. She was wearing nothing but an unbuttoned pink flannel shirt. She was fingering herself and moaning. I was starting to get into it when I suddenly realized that this woman was really small (like 4ft if she was standing up). That's when two long ears popped up. The \"woman\" slid down my torso and onto my groin. The light from the bathroom was much brighter where she moved, and I knew exactly who it was... It was goddamn Judy Hopps from Zootopia (great movie BTW). I looked at my right arm and saw that I had a tranquilizer dart (part of the hallucination) stuck in it. I decided to nope the fuck out, so I tried to wiggle and scream to wake myself up. Unfortunately, all I could manage was a really weak whimper. Judy noticed this and smirked. Then she leaned forward, putting her face within an inch of mine. In an incredibly sultry tone she cooed, \"What's that sweetheart? I'm afraid I didn't hear a no.\" She bit my ear and started grinding against my crotch cowgirl style. Although it was fucked up as all hell, I got extremely turned on. I popped a boner, and it poked all the way out of my fly (frigging boxer shorts). Judy immediately grabbed my dick and stuck it inside her. She rode me for what felt about 5 minutes moaning and dirty talking for the entire duration. She also periodically clawed my chest, kissed me, and pressed herself against me (I could feel her body heat, soft fur, and heartbeat). When I orgasmed, I gained full control of my body again. The visual hallucination stopped, but I could still hear her voice and feel myself inside of her (although much fainter). All hallucinating stopped after about 15 seconds. The orgasm I experienced was far more intense than anything I had felt my entire life. It was mindblowingly incredible. I was uncontrollably shaking for a solid two minutes after it. My boxers and some of my sheets were absolutely covered in jizz. I was able to wipe the sheets almost completely clean, but my boxers were so soaked that I went to my bathroom and chucked them in the bottom of the trash. While I was in the bathroom, I decided to rub another one out. I then showered and played video games until the sun came up (the hallucination happened at 4:00ish I think). I have told a few good friends about the experience, and we had a good hearty laugh about it. However, I didn't tell them the graphic details; I didn't want to gross them out too bad. This experience was nothing like a dream. Dreams are kinda fuzzy and seem very separated from reality when you wake up. This experience on the other hand felt 100% real. It literally felt like Judy Hoppes Hot Cosby'd me. It was as real to my mind as any other actual experience in my waking life. It was pretty damn funny to me (internally) when I went to see the movie again with my parents. I couldn't help but think how this character was innocently entertaining a moviegoing audience that was blissfully unaware of how she touched my no-no.\n\nTL;DR: Judy Hopps did indeed \"Try Everything\" including rape someone that doesn't even exist in her universe. \n\nTL;DR the TL;DR: Judy Hopps is a trans-dimensional rapist.\n\nTL;DR the TL;DR to the TL;DR: Rabbits do indeed fuck like rabbits. \n\nTL;DR the TL;DR to the TL;DR to the TL;DR: Just read the motherfletching story you lazy twat.\n\nEdit: a word\n\nEdit: There be gold in these waters!","I'm actually really jealous of you right now.

","I've posted this in similar threads before, but I'm posting it again because the support and insight I've received in the past has been incredibly helpful. I wish I could say that things have gotten any better for me since I last posted this a year ago. Unfortunately, I don't find life with a paraphilia all that easy. It makes sex an anxious and complicated affair. It makes me question myself fundamentally. It makes me alone in what I believe to be a terrible secret.\n\nIt's off to the therapist for me, because I simply need to know why.\n\n\"I've had a fetish since I was 5 years old.\n\nI love to watch men sleep. I love to watch them, and feel them fall asleep. The way their muscles gradually start to loosen, little by little. A twitch here, and they start breathing deeply, or better yet, they snore.\n\nMy very first memory of the fetish is when I was 5, and I had a little friend over. A little boy friend. I forced him to lay in my bed and I put on the Lion King soundtrack and started vocalizing something akin to a guided meditation. I wanted to see him sleep. I can only imagine now how weird that must have been for him. I was doing something perverted, and I didn't even know it. Somehow I'm certain the fetish was sparked earlier than that incident, but I can't remember, and I'd rather not.\n\nAnother distinct occasion for me is when I was about 12-13, and our little neighbour boy, who was around age 10 at that time, was at our house, and he fell asleep on the couch. I openly watched. I couldn't stop looking at him. I was disturbed and intrigued. I wanted him gone, but I couldn't peel my eyes away. There was a spark in me. I was on the cusp of becoming a sexual being, if I wasn't already. This incident stuck with me, even then.\nI didn't realize it was a fetish and that it was something real and different until I was 23 years old. Once I caught on to it, I started to become a fucking creep. I still am. I pin down my boyfriend when he wakes up in the morning, or when he's simply lying down. I hold him there until he falls asleep. Then I masturbate. Furiously. When I wake up earlier than him, he'll roll over and lay his head on my chest. It's sweet. But as soon as I feel his body give in to sleep, I become so wet. I practically boil. Eventually, he rolls back over, and I masturbate, such amazing masturbation, and he is none the wiser.\n\nAnd I hate myself. Hate.\n\nI read once that somnophilia is a predatory paraphilia. I'd just fucking love to know what the psychology is behind it. It's such a simple thing but it's actually a huge problem for me. I can't admit it to my boyfriend. I'm just too ashamed and embarrassed. If I ever admit it, he'll question all the times we snuggled in bed together in loving bliss. Behind a majority of those snuggles was an extraordinarily wet woman burning for the touch of her own finger. It's definitely having a negative effect on our sex life. I pretty much never initiate sex unless the exact right chain of events happens and he dozes off quickly, I get wet, and he wakes up. I hardly ever get wet in the traditional way. I only get wet via my paraphilia. It fucking sucks.\n\nLately it has taken a me a large amount of strength to not take his finger and touch myself with it when he's conked out. I can't do it, it's impossible. It would be the worst violation. But I want it so bad. I goddamn ache for it. But I dare not.\n\nI am stuck in my secrecy and I long for a normal sex life.\"","I don't think it's as bad as you think it is. Unless your boyfriend is very closed minded about kinks if you told him he'd probably be cool with it. Lots of guys would like to wake up to that sort of thing. The not getting off on anything else thing is probably the worst of it and maybe that is worth seeing a therapist about. But no one really chooses what they're into so there's no sense feeling bad about it.","If you trust your boyfriend then tell him. If he shames you for it then he's an immature asshole anyway.. Everyone has their thing and it's nothing to be ashamed of unless it's affecting your daily life or if it's causing harm to someone.\n\nHell, you don't even have to tell him before you do it. Just take his pants off after he falls asleep. I really doubt he'll complain when he wakes up, lol. Then maybe afterwards when you're both feeling good you can explain it to him.","We tried the exact same thing. Turns out neither of us have pee fetishes.

So I'd been talking with my gf about her being the dominant one, and we both agreed we would try it. Before today it had almost entirely been the other way around. When she arrived home after being away for a week, I surprised her by having my hands tied together, naked on the bed with a condom in my mouth. The sight of me ready for her to use got her turned on, and after a bit of making out, we started to get into it.\n\nI'd beg her to sit on my face and then ride my dick, but sometimes I'd get frustrated by her teasing and try to grab her, and she'd pin me down and tell me off. Eventually I managed to slip one hand out of my improvised handcuffs and started to feel her up. Far from pleased, she then uncuffed me and made me lie on my stomach, and she whipped me 10 times with my belt. After that I begged her and she said I could touch her for a little bit. I was rough with her, and eventually she gave in back to being submissive. Now that I was on top of her, she began to cry (very rare occurance) saying that she was no good as dom. I grabbed her head and made her look me in the eye and told her never to say that. After a while of convincing, we fucked again, and ended up with her riding me, before fingering herself and then making me gag on her fingers by sticking them down my throat. This turned me on so much, and was the first time I'd ever cum from her riding me. Later when she left she texted me saying that she felt so bad telling me off, and I'd give her a sheepish look that would melt her heart.\n\nI swear there was a point to this story.

It became quickly apparent that my biggest \"trigger\", so to speak, was humiliation.  I liked to be made inferior. Like I wasn't enough for her on my own so she had to make me do all this stuff for her so she could be satisfied.  Jesus. Writing that gave me chills.\n\nAnyway.  I stumbled across some cuckold porn one day and the rest is kind of history.  \n\nShe cheated on me.  I think the most complicated emotion I have EVER felt, by far, is discovering I was a cuck, and then getting cheated on. It's...confusing, to say the least.","I must ask, in all seriousness, were you turned on when you found out she cheated or no?","That's a hard question to answer.\n\nI guess the short answer would be yes, extremely.  It was sort of a weird spot in the relationship where she was being manipulative so I let certain things happen. In other words, I knew she was cheating, and she even told me about it a few times, but I let it happen because I didn't want to lose her. It was a really bad spot in my life.\n\nBut yes, it turned me on. My biggest and most secret kink? Hell yes. I mean, I hadn't even told her about it. She knew, but that's besides the point.  The straw that broke the camels back and consequently caused me to finally leave her, however, did not turn me on at all, and rather just made me really sad. ","Aww, well I am sorry to hear that man.

She was wearing [wedges](http://s.tidebuy.com/images/product/10/10514/10514342_1.jpg) kinda like this and until then I hadnt really though much about it but I always though she had cute feet and nice shoes and I ended up commenting on her shoes and her nail paint after we had parked.\n\nShe proceeded to take her wedges off and starts rubbing her feet on my crotch through my jeans and I got diamond hard. She didnt act odd about it and just as cool as you please she takes my pants off and goes to work. Ended up blowing my load all over her feet in what has to be one of the 10 best orgasms ive ever had. Probably the best FJ ive ever had, she was pretty good at it for not having tried it before and was really, really good with her toes.\n\nTo top it off, later in the week I was fingering her and she sticks her feet in my face and she had the most pleasant scent ive ever encountered and i end up kissing and licking her feet the entire time.\n\nAfter that week we ended up really opening up to each other and finally we both (shared, traded, gave away?) ended up as each others firsts in the back of that car.\n\nId still love her if I didnt hate her so much and she was easily the most physically attractive person ive ever been with at 4'7 and 105lbs with the best 36b's ive ever seen.\n\nShe used to do the most kinky stuff with me, but those times are gone now.\n\n\nSo, now everyone knows I have a huge foot fetish, GG reddit.","Was with my first squirter a little while back.

That's the way I personally understand the word paedophile. The DSM-V disagree with that though, and say that it's enough to be attracted to someone who cannot legally consent. That's a bit tricky, since someone can be 15 in Sweden and legally able to consent, while if the same boy was american he would be legally unable to consent, which would make me a paedophile according to DSM-V if I was attracted to him. It's my opinion that a definition that rely on which country the person you like is from, is a problematic definition, so I generally don't think about it like that. Also, of course, it would mean that anyone who is attracted to a fully mature 17 year old american girl from the wrong state is a paedophile technically speaking, and I find that ridiculous, how many people didn't openly say they were attracted to Emma Watson or celebrities like that before they were 18?

Since then I was hooked. \n\nFast forward to about six years ago when my wife and I were trying to spice things up. She knew of my nude-in-public fetish, and when on vacation in Florida we went to a BDSM club. We were not hardcore BDSM folks and enjoyed sensation play mostly.  I had communicated with the owner of the club before we arrived and once there in the play room he ordered her to remove her clothes. She did and spent the entire night mingling with about 30 people.  I was in heaven. \n\nWe ended up finding several clubs near home and I always made her attend events in the nude.  She became very popular.  \n\nThe first event near home was a party at a home owned by a Master. We scheduled a pizza party where my wife served 20 guests in the nude. We found another place that hosted parties in a large facility. They had equipment like a hoist, a gyno chair, and a grope box.  \n\nOn many occasions I had her strapped to the gyno chair with legs spread wide with 20 men looking on.  I would sometimes allow other guys to feel her tits or finger her pussy but that is the extent of it.\n\nBoth places closed a few years ago and we haven't found another local club that allows full nudity.

That doesn't mean she can't be sexy, can't use her sexuality but it has to be her driving it, she need to be the driving force, that is the point - if i'm in some weird position of power over her, a spectral voyeur who she exists only to please then it's already ruined any connection i may have to the scene, i can't feel her power or his submission...  \n  \nThen she starts going on about all this sissy rubbish, sure some people are into that but not everyone, what i'd much rather see is a mentally and physically strong person caught up in a web of intrigue  which binds him emotionally, logistically and finally physically to the will of a strong minded and mentally confident woman.  \n  \nThe scene opens on a middle aged woman in a powersuit standing infront of a younger man, he's bound wrists and ankles against a pillar his trousers around his ankles and his shirt pulled back over his shoulders, 'you're used to having it pretty good aren't you? I bet you though that being a big man with a meaty cock' she wraps her hands around his shaft stroking it with a slow grin before looking up and him and running a sticky finger over his well defined jaw '...and a pretty face that your life would always be a cavalcade of pretty women, one-night stands and boasting to the boys at the watercooler...' He long slender fingers slide down his chest trailing the nails slowly over his skin 'well your momma shoulda warned you that for every cool cat there's a sharp-toothed Bitch ready to pounce.' lifting her palm but leaving her nails to scrape over his belly as her hand reached down to grasp his helplessly erect member in a frighteningly firm grasp 'because you're mine now pretty boy, you understand that right?' taking her left hand and cupping his balls in a firm squeeze she continued 'you're my little pleasure toy, you're my reward for all those years as a silly-little girl being taken advantage of by pervy older men...' she laughed 'yeah, they taught me a thing or two... they taught me everything I needed to know to pluck myself a pretty little stud from the Sales team and trap him in my web....' sliding her hand up his chest again she grasps his nipple and squeezes it 'my little stress toy...' she cackled 'my little punching bag...' she gave several playful but solid jabs to his gut 'my little dildo.' squeezing his cock at the base so his dick bulges with trapped blood and the veins stick out as the shaft turns red 'my big dildo...' she corrected herself 'and we're going to teach you to fuck in all MY favourite ways...' she slides her hand up his shaft slowly making his cock ache as it bulges and slips through her firmly gripped hand. 'and we're going to find all sorts of fun games to play with you...' she taking her hand away and in one motion bringing it round and up to flick his bollocks just hard enough to make him gasp 'lots of fun games... but plenty of time for that, let's enjoy your pretty little lips first, the lips that have lured so many of the attractive young admin staff into your bed...' she pushed herself against him and kissed his lips forcing him to kiss back, forcing him to kiss with all his passion and all his skill then she broke the kiss unceremoniously 'very good, i've picked well... not just a big dick' slapping his cock playfully and causing it to bounce against his leg she leaned in a kissed him again, this time for longer really enjoying herself and grinding against him 'don't worry you'll enjoy most of what we do, or you'll learn to...' she kissed him some more 'but that isn't important, i'm going to enjoy myself immensely that's all that matters..' the pressure in her thigh as it grinds against his cocks and balls increases as she raises her leg and pushes against him with her knee just hard enough for the fear to show in the corners of his eyes 'serve me well and I might let you enjoy yourself sometimes, i might even let you keep a little-tiny bit of your dignity... you might, if you're a really good little fuckboy be able to learn how to make this a very plesurable situation for yourself - but let me down or disappoint me and you'll learn a whole new range of sensations, sensations designed to act as corrective measures against your poor choices...' screen fades, opening credits roll - 94 part mega-series on HBO written, directed and starring me.

If a confused Meursault had been blinded by the sun and groped an arab then would that make the central theme of his detachment from emotion weaker? actually i think it'd maybe even make it stronger, the notion that you could ruin the greatest works of literature and rob them of any worth and meaning simply by adding sexuality to them is both offensive and absurd.  \n  \nIt stands to reason then that if the great works can't be ruined by addition then and newly generated work also is safe, the wisdom and the horn need not conflict and if done well can add to each other. \n  \n Story of the Eye looks really interesting, i'll give it a read if i get the chance, thanks.

To deal with these very weighty ideas i've stepped back away from the conformist perception of society and tried to depict a timelessly honest age, the scene is set in Egypt circa who-knows-when way before the prejudices and biases had even been invented, it is the love story between two people and their ideas, and their sense of self, their bodies and most of all their human experience. \n  \nI think it's real point is to try and say that maybe we're looking at history all wrong, maybe writing out the sex and drugs isn't helpful, maybe just assuming that everything sexual or intoxicating has always been for idiots and fools is not just offensive but absurd to the highest order - to know oneself is the highest most vital part of being alive and to try and deny yourself pleasure? to deny yourself freedom within your own mind? these are the things that are insane, jacking off to your own reflection is not mad, finding sixty-eight different sensations to pleasure yourself with is not mad, exploring your passions is not insanity - no, not doing these things is insanity!

I want to say that i do not seek beauty of the body for all bodies are beautiful that support a wonderful mind, that if a person has a warm heart and sharp mind then their look represents what it is to be thus, to be thusly beautiful and thusly adored.  \n  \nHight, or weight, or face don't concern me for the whole world is wonderful and beauty is in all things - I ask for so little but yet i ask for so much, all i seek is a mind which is open, which is free, which is sensitive and kind, a mind full of compassion and cold-calculations, a mind which knows enough of itself to seek more, that has tasted enough of the world to be hungry for it, a mind which wants to love me, which wants to share the world with me and feed from my soul....  \n  \nSo if you have a sapiosexual crush on someone the tell them you want to hold them, want to love them, want to be with them on the great journey through wonder and awe, through passion and perversion, though sex and love. Tell them that you want to explore with them, that you want to explore them and be explored by them - that you will open yourself to them and trust them, that you will adore them and cherish them, that for fascination sake you're willing to step into secret concourse with them and together reach and spy places and sensations sweet and saccharine...  \n  \n[include a picture with your pm] [haha no i jest, i jest, you don't have to include a picture in your pm just tell me a bit about yourself and your interests and we'll go from there.... oh but it'd help if you're from the uk or have travel plans] ","Get this man two actors and a camera.","So fucking turned on, think I may have to go 'abuse' my boyfriend","If I ever get those millions of dollars I want, and start a porn studio, like I've imagined doing, you're definitely on the short list of writers I'd hire.","hey well I've got a decent camera, good enough to start us off - we start out taking turns being the slut, i dunno what you look-like but I pass as a bit of a jock, a pretty boy or even with the right makeup, lighting and my long hair styled nicely I could be a cock-hungry cross-dresser...

At the end you're kinda shell shocked, kinda confused but when i congratulate you and say it'll be a great video the triumph and joy on your face is palpable even though the layers of dribbling cum running down your face.  \n  \nAgain we sell it to no-one for 4.99 but spray it all over the filesharing sites as 'best ever exploited cocksucker first-time incest twink hot sexy facial cum' and anything else we can shoehorn it as, i don't know if we'd pass as uncle and nephew or brothers or something but so what, bad tags are fine because it's pirates doing it, right? we just gotta get it out there...  \n  \nThe videos now move with slow and steady progression, some of me teasing you and sucking you, making your knees shake and heart thump but most are me using your mouth as my own personal pleasure toy, teaching you how to be the perfect little slut for me -- all in the name of making good videos of course... We push some boundaries, create some strange and interesting experimental plots and stories - all kinda brilliant in a b-movie way but without a doubt created in the perverse mind of uncle ik purely to get another beautiful blowjob off his now kinda subservient business partner... \n  \nThe big moment is coming, hints have been dropped that we're getting somewhere and it's obvious but not explicit I've convinced you that this will be the one, this will push us to the point we can afford a beautiful women... Losing your anal virginity makes a great video, we focus on the nerves and the fear filling you but discretely and as if i'm trying to reassure you - it hard to tell if i'm simply trying to coax you for my own perverse pleasure or i really am trying to help you into something i know you want because i really have come to deeply love you... At the end we're cuddling, you're proud of yourself and i'm proud of you, my hand reassuringly stroking you almost, mostly, off-camera while we complete the final bit of the video where you say how much you enjoyed it but of course the real story is around that, is how I respond and this new connection and link between us, this visible love...\n  \nThe next video starts with a beautiful woman, a very beautiful woman with the nicest ripest breasts and the smoothest curving hips... I welcome her to the study and ask if she's excited, of course she is she's really excited - her professionalism just makes the lie ever more obvious, it's ok though i'm happyenough as i grope at her chest and begin to remove her clothes, as i stroke her beautiful flesh and enjoy the scents and textures of her body. Everything is about my hunger for her beauty, everything except the occasional 'should be edited out' command for you to move around to get an angle or close-up as I undress her, as i caresses and kiss her, as i lay her down and mount her, as i bend her over and fuck her deep and long, as I paw and grope at her delightful body, as i spray my sticky load all over her wonderful ass... Then she's heading to the bathroom, pure professionalism shoot-over, you're half following but as if totally thoughtless i call you to record my post-show monologue, my description of her best features and the dizzying pleasure i felt fucking her... The woman returns cleaned up and starts getting dressed, you film her almost forlornly and i can just about be heard to say 'don't worry, the money will start rolling in, we had to make it a good one right, you'll get a turn....' \n  \nThe best-videos get packaged into a rar file and uploaded somewhere then on reddit and places we hit it hard with fake accounts talking about how awesome, funny, sad, tragic, erotic and interesting this is, we make it a meme almost like lemon stealing whores, we make it so everyone knows about pervy uncle ik and has manipulative ways... about his obedient and hard-done-by fuck-toy business partner.... \n  \nHopefully we can ride a bit of a wave, people will buy at least one of our overpriced videos to 'help the cause' the money really will start to roll in and of course this will be reflected with new women, new locations, new equipment and more skilled technical crew... You'll be still be my main co-star of course, you'll always be there to get me hard, to keep my going with almost-off-camera fluffing while i eat beautiful pussy or suckle on divine teats... we'll get you involved with the women also, with kissing their feet or sucking my cum from them, we'll let you play bit roles where you hold them or grope them or almost join in.... when the demand is at it's peek we'll relent and in some public display of overcoming even a great mind like mine you'll regain your power and stake in the company so that you've got your own wing to make personal fantasy videos, in reality i'll probably still write most of them but it'll be about you engaging in the most fantasy fulfilling activities man can dream of, even a perverse genius like uncle Ik.. I of course will be compelled to throw myself into my work in a fit of depressed and rejected neurosis, i will be forced to make audience pleasing works ever more elaborate and involved -kink chasing and fetish finding will be be the only light in my life, it'll be obvious i'm pining for my fucktoy but never quite able to replace that link we had however far and however wild i push things, and we do push them far and wild - the most intense and interesting things become the starting point from which we race at headlong speed towards insanity, like a carcrash of porn the viewers can't turn away, can't miss an episode...  \n  \nfinally of course pressures internal and external force us both back together... the final million dollar show","Wonderful essay.

Big breasts, wide ass and hips, a decent layer of body fat, but something about a woman actually being visibly pregnant throws that into overdrive, and having all those mother's to be in the same room flipped the switch.\n\nI guess, at least to my brain, the ultimate sign of being an attractive, bountiful, fertile mate, is already being pregnant.","What did you do when he showed up?","You can also shove her panties in her mouth as a gag.","My first experience with my main fetish, in person, occurred years after realizing that it's something I'm into. I can't entirely recall when it went from one to the other. It started as general urophilia regarding females; the act of peeing where they're not supposed to (in public, in pants, on guys/girls, etc) but morphed into what is called 'omorashi', or specifically holding/wetting.\n\nBesides specific fetish websites, I have to thank of of the girls I went to school with for it.\n\nAfter I graduated and got a car, her and I would hang out- usually going up to the local wildlife park for hiking, or walking on and off the trail at a few other parks. Sometimes we'd just go for a drive. Almost every time, she would end up being desperate to pee and I, conniving twat that I am, had designed our walk in such a way that by the time she had to go, we would be 20+ minutes away from the nearest bathroom. She would usually hold it and try to make it to the bathroom, but she seldom did and popped a squat just off the trail. About half the time when she did make it back to the bathrooms, they would be locked up, and she'd let 'er rip right on the concrete in front of the door.\n\nI doubted that it was coincidental that it happened almost every time we hung out; and was later made aware that she was aware that I enjoyed her predicament when she asked if she could use the bathroom at the start of a hike and bribed me with taking nude photos of her at the peak. Since I was longing to see her in the nude, I of course accepted.\n\nNever ended up with a copy of those photos, since they were on her camera. :/","It's not any less sanitary than unprotected sex...","...I think it is, but I don't know enough about the subject to dispute you...","Unprotected sex &gt; blood to mucous contact ","Greater than what?

I got an instant boner. A few years later at 16, I had my first serious gf. The thing we did the most was go into her kitchen and I was take her shirt off and pull her pants down. It was from that point on I found out I had the fetish of girls in their underwear, being pantsed or wedgied.","I was fucking this guy for maybe the second or third time and he very gently slapped my face and asked me if that was okay. I reacted with a ton of enthusiasm so he hit me twice more, a lot harder each time. I told him he wasn't even trying. That's how I got a bruised lip/cheek and a cool new SO yay\n\nGoing to work the next day knowing I looked like I'd been the victim of domestic abuse was such a huge turn-on too.

Ultimatesurrender is probably the best out there for this.\n\nI don't consider myself submissive or dominant, but I definitely am extremely aroused by watching someone use someone else for their own sexual pleasure. Like... just use them to achieve orgasm. None of this whips/chains/pain/etc...

Don't know if it's me or I can't find any good porn or what. I also used to be into nipple torture but again, it's not doing it for me. Most porn just bores me now.

Also he smokes a lot so his breath tastes like I was actually smoking, which weirdly turned me on. He was a really good kisser. I never met anyone kisses like him again. :-/","This is the first time I saw biting mentioned. I remember my boyfriend at the time biting my breast as I was about to orgasm and I came so effing hard. I realized I like to be bit while having sex, and I especially like it when they leave a mark on me. ","I didn't realize this was a fetish. The girl I had a thing with last summer would gently bite my bottom lip while making out/suck it between her teeth, and that felt fucking amazing. She also left scratches on my back this one time, and I had work (lifeguarding) the next day. That was...interesting.","Used to be a FWB to one of my classmates back in college. Good god do I miss those days with her. She tore my back the fuck up, to the point that I had to have her stop to let the other scratches heal. I had many nicknames and it was some of the best sex I've had, especially because she was so quaint and polite anywhere else but her home. \n\nRecently surfaced after not talking for years and was hoping that she'd be up for grabs since she was almost my gf for a while - but she's been in a relationship for 5 years this year and is really happy. I'm glad for her, but gg do I miss those days with her.","My 1st gf liked it rough and bit and scratched and liked to get hit and be tied up etc, and she claimed she couldn't help it (turns out she wanted to piss me off so I'd smack her, she could've just told me but oh well).\n\nSo turns out I'm into rough sex but not really pain and every time she bit my lip I'd flinch backwards cause pain can do that. Later on she was biting harder and harder and as I instinctively pulled back I heard a riping noise. Now here's where it turns into a full fuck up. \n\nThis girl did some dog sitting and I was allowed to go over and help walk the dogs sometimes. We had broken up some time ago when this happened but decided to remain fuck buddies (poor idea btw). And to avoid her parents were doing it at her workplace on the couch - a cunt move to be sure but I was 16, cmon.\n\nAnyway so when this incident occurred blood went everywhere and I wasn't meant to be over. Since she was a bitch I was yelled at and kicked me out for bleeding everywhere so not knowing what to do I decided cycled home with my bottom lip with a big hole in it. \n\nTrying to formulate an excuse I decided to say I fell off my bike, so I got off scott free. Well apart from the scar on my face and an hour in a waiting line for the emergency room and a lot of pain.\n\nTLDR: rough sex can leave scars and exes are exes for reasons.","Said it before in this thread, I'll say it again.\n\nRuff.

Then she moved down to my ass and then started playing with my balls (she knows I love that) well, next thing you know, she spreads my legs a bit and she's gently sucking on me and then licking my balls... which leads her to a full on licking my Perineum.\n\nLet's pause for a moment and speak about how goddamn amazing that felt. Sure she's rubbed that area during a hand job before and that felt good but a mouth/tongue applying pressure, licking, flicking... it was almost too much for me to deal with. Honestly, I've never EVER clenched the bed/sheets during a sexual experience. Sure I've felt AMAZING but nothing has ever EVER made me have to hold on to something that tightly.\n\n\nAnyway, she begins to touch and rub closer and closer to my anus (that sounds so clinical and asshole sounds too vulgar. So we will refer to it as my StarGate (shut up, I'm a nerd) from here on out). But given my past trepidations, she slows down and tells me that I should take about a 20 minute nap. My head is still pounding a bit and this sounds like a GREAT idea...\n\nI set a timer for 20 minutes and after I woke, she came in the room and threw the covers off of me. I explain I'm cold and she starts going down on me again. She knows that one of my favorite things EVER is when she takes me in while I'm flaccid and works it until I'm hard (which she does). Then she has me flip over again and picks up where she left off. Now I'm on my hands and knees and she's essentially milking my dick and making it incredibly sloppy which.... yes yes yes. Then she starts at my perineum again with her hands all slick like while alternating with her tongue. But while she's doing that she backs off with her tongue and just uses her hands on both my dick and my perineum... going ever so close to my StarGate, her finger touching it occasionally.\n\nI'm only minorly aware of this as all of my senses are now completely going haywire in a dense sex fog so thick that Silent Hill's next installment should be called \"Silent Hill: StarGate\". Something that I only halfway realized though was that I kept moving my ass closer and closer to her. It was completely submissive in my actions without my control. I was just giving her my ass, essentially. So here my wife is, rubbing my StarGate and milking my dick with SO much GUSTO! She notices my legs are getting tired from being on all fours and she realizes that I am probably not going to cum like this more than likely because of the new sensations. She tells me to lay on my back. Notation After asking for clarification on one thing, apparently she had a finger in my ass about halfway through this entire process and the time between her asking and me flipping over was a fair amount of time. I was seriously still in Silent Hill so... fuck if I know. I do and she's at the edge of the bed, sliding her hands up and down, rubbing my perineum at the same time and I'm lost. My face is muffled by the pillow I'm holding over it so I don't alert the kids to the assault I'm experiencing. She keeps rubbing and rubbing and apparently I'm relaxing more and more. And apparently she notices this because at this moment, she slides her finger in again and this time, maybe because I'm on my back now, I notice and the knowing part sends me reeling. We're talking... mayyyybe slightly past her first knuckle of her middle finger. I can't contain myself. Finger going in, hand stroking down, finger sliding out, hand strokes up... and then I came. Hard. Hard enough for us to need to change the sheets because I shot pretty far past my body...\n\nMy legs were trembling... my legs don't tremble. I mean, they were out of control like something out of /r/quiver[2] and it was just... amazing. I was moaning this low, steady moan throughout my orgasm and was drenched in sweat. My wife, oh she had this look of accomplishment, playfulness and all around happiness... Like she just caught all of the flies while playing Karate Kid for the NES on the first try.\n\nHonestly, I'm just now really fully \"coming down\" from it (this happened on Saturday). But the range of emotions are many. From excited to feeling nurtured by the entire experience. The care she took with me, the pacing and awareness of if I would like it or not... And the after care as well. As a product of the 80's and an evangelical christian upbringing, for the most part, ass play was treated as a homosexual act growing up. With my perusing of the internet I'm smarter than that but still... it's something that is sometimes in the back of my mind. But I quickly broke from that thinking as again, I know better. This is something that I'm going to enjoy... something that felt fucking amazing. And I couldn't have a better woman to experience this with. Thanks for listening :D\n\nTL,DR: My wife was giving me a handjob and the next thing you know she's stumbling through the StarGate and we ended up needing to do Laundry after my legs gave out.","Nice nice nice! Do you like be a submissive?","There is a bit of submissiveness in me, yes.

","I had always wanted to have a threesome (what guy doesn't?) when one miraculous day my SO of a couple years at the time brought up threesomes herself. It started with her having fantasies of MFM and FMF threesomes, and I wanted an FMF, but was totally cool w/ MFM too.\n\nWe had an MFM, and met one or two couples as well. Turns out she really doesn't like sleeping with other men. But what we discovered is her kink is watching me fuck other women! Now we're swingers and regularly seek single women for either threesomes or just for me to fuck while my SO watches. It also turns out my kinks are casual sex w/ new partners, threesomes, group sex, and  exhibitionism so it works out perfectly for us. We've been together about 4yrs now and I honestly believe we're perfect for each other.","Don't mind me.

","My second girlfriend lived with her sister and her parents and so we didn't have a lot of space to do things together. I discovered that I enjoyed convincing her to have sex in risky places far more than the sex itself, and from there I set out to explore my dominant side. Over the years I encouraged her to go further and further outside of her comfort zone, taking pleasure in her successes and the power I had. \n\nUnfortunately the relationship ended due to me being a foolish teenager, but I've learned, developed and refined that dominant side and I've found it rewarding with so many people who want to feel 'owned'. 50 shades of grey only increased my available base of women to explore with and even many years on I still get that rush of adrenaline when I play the master role.","Haha wow ....he doesn't use a PAIR of socks he just uses one....

Never was sexually abused as a child but I was horny as all hell as a kid.  I never understood what it was or what to call it at the time.  ","I was having vanilla sex with my girlfriend when we were both seriously intoxicated. I accidentally (actually an accident) slipped it into her butt and we finished up that way. I didn't even notice until afterwards when she said, \"Sooo.. anal this time?\"\n\nThe next day I started thinking about it, and it soon became my kink.  Not slipping it in whilst drunk, just anything anal.  Fucking, fingering, licking.\n\nIt's not the most important thing, so I've never sought out a girl to fulfill the full fantasy, but when my current girlfriend gives up the booty from time to time it's always a huge nut.","/u/pyrocynical is that you?","no","Fuck me, that's fairly niche. ","Ross?","This will give him more time for his Karate.","I was a pubescent teen, lying in bed thinking about Heather Thomas and that beautiful pink bikini picture and how I just wanted to hug her and press my pelvis into her beautiful posterior. Then it occurred to me that poop comes from butts, and a poop is about the same size as a penis. Heeeyyy, I bet it would feel pretty amazing to push my erect penis into her butt! Ohh, that's so wrong and dirty!\n\n...and so a fetish was born.\n\nI honestly thought I invented anal sex. (this is a few years before internet was a thing, btw)","She didn't pee on you in the shower because she thought it was funny","Wonder why some of them have been set to private. I know I've visited /r/HappyEmbarrassedGirls in the past.","I used to be kind of timid and shy in bed until I dated a really submissive girl with borderline personality disorder.  I'm not even sure how it happened, but over the progress of our relationship the sex just kept getting more and more rough.  If I wasn't dominating, she would kind of coax it out of me by e.g. giving me really hard deepthroat, holding herself down until she needed to gasp for air, forcing it into her throat, etc.\n\nIt kind of felt...wrong at first.  I would wake up the next day feeling guilty like I had violated her in some way, and so part me wanted to stay away from her. But honestly, it was the best god damned sex I'd ever had and it's how she wanted it, so I kept going back for more.\n\nAt some point, I guess a dominating side took over because I was running the show, pulling her hair, slapping her around, holding her head down, choking her, sticking my fingers down her throat while I fucked her doggy style, scratching her back so hard that she bleeds and has marks for weeks, etc., and at some point it started to feel way more sexy than guilty.\n\nI've had partners since her who were not into sex quite as violent, but all since her have had a dom/sub dynamic.  Not that I was seeking it out, the dynamic just seems to rise naturally in response to me dominating.\n\nThe upside is that I have incredible sex.  The downside is that vanilla sex just seems not even worth bothering with anymore.  If I met someone I really liked but who only wanted vanilla sex, I don't think that could satisfy me.  \n\nInterestingly enough, this hasn't been a problem.  Every women I've been with since her was either into it or thought it was ridiculously hot after they agreed to try it. Makes me wonder if after me they'll be able to enjoy vanilla sex again, or if I'm corrupting them the way my ex corrupted me. ","I have the same problem, but reverse the genders. it's really difficult to try to hurt the woman you love.","All of my fetishes seemingly manifested when I was a prepubescent and had no understanding of sex.\n\nI remember reading fairy tales and liking the princes wearing tights.

Eventually, I intend to make a turn-based tactics game about humans vs mythological creatures (including dragons!), so for now I'm learning how to program better so I can script the game better.\n\nI've been thinking of trying to figure out how to draw so I can make art assets, too, but that might not be physically feasible for a dragon.","That sounds like a fantastic idea! Do you have a name picked out yet? Is it going to be in a medieval setting or a modern one?","It's either going to be European Medieval or Ancient Roman, since modern relies a lot on ranged combat, something that gryphons, mermaids, cyclops, etc. don't really have.\n\nMy working name for it if it's medieval is just \"Medieval Combat\" because I'm bad at names. Maybe \"Mythic Tactics\"?","Maybe go into the reason for the conflict. Did something in particular happen to set it off? Do humans just despise the creatures? Is there a particular reason for the binary distrust?\n\nAnd would the humans refer to the creatures as mythic? ","I'm not really sure about the human campaign, but the creatures' campaign is probably a Dragon seeking to expand his territory and power (which translates quite nicely to having a ramp-up of both available units as he claims more territories and difficulty as he attracts the attention of stronger rivals). I might make the human campaign some sort of \"fight your way through the Dragon's territory and rescue the princess\" thing, although that seems a tad clich&amp;eacute;.\n\nThey'd probably refer to them as mythical, at least in that there are myths surrounding them. I might go with \"legendary\" instead, like how some games have legendary weapons that people don't really seem all that surprised actually exist.","I'm not sure what motivation the humans would have for rescuing a princess while getting the snot kicked out of them by a dragon's legendary hordes. \n\nMaybe there's some kind of magic or knowledge somewhere that would give the humans an edge against the dragon, since they don't see a way to defend themselves as is. They could go off to that direction, while the dragon seeks to hold the land he's taken and also prevent them from reaching their goal. The magic could be a third direction, with the dragon seeking land, sparking off the conflict which sends the humans against the dragon, and ultimately off to the magic, with their goals intersecting when they realize the advantage its owner could have. ","Sounds interesting! I'd say I'd be curious to hear about it if you get to that point, but I assume I'll notice if you have anything to share on Reddit.\n\nI've had a couple of dragon-related game ideas myself, but there's been zero progress on them due to laziness.","How about Unity?

Art can never exist without nudity displayed. I loved that album but my father owned the only record player in the house and there was a strict no-touch policy.

No Paul Simon for three months was hard I can go without /r/torpedotits longer than no Paul Simon so when my dad returned with Graceland in hand it was like Christmas.

And the more I delved into it, the more I found things to go with it that really got me going, like breast/body growth, submission, underage/schoolgirl, non-con, sadism and it's like 100x hotter with pregnancy involved. Especially in a voyeuristic way. So there's that.\n   \nIt kind of bums me out being a woman because of that stuff, since ironically the idea of being pregnant myself completely grosses me out. \n\n ","There are few things the mind cannot overcome, if as you mentioned the voyeuristic interest include non con impregnation.

","Ha. Curious, do you actually act like an animal or just basically get tied up and bossed around submissively? ","Honestly that depends on the submissive's reason for enjoying pet play.\n\nSome of us just really like being able to get into sub space, or in this case puppy space, and have only the most basic of thoughts for stretches of time, i.e. \"I'm hungry\" \"I'm bored\" \"I'm horny\", and then be able to act on those instinctually without any decision making process, i.e. bark at your food dish, play with a ball, hump things. This type of play often includes props like knee pads and face masks. While it can involve sex that's usually not the reason for the play.\n\nSome of us (I'm more in this camp) just really love being dehumanized, being treated like something owned and needing care, and losing control of things like verbal communication and use of your hands while still being free to move around. This tends to be a more sexually focused play experience. I've found that a lot of the submissives who prefer this type of submission have puppyish personality traits, such as being eager to please and easily excited.\n\nMy experience obviously isn't representative of the whole community, but I've done some reading on the subject since it's a thing I enjoy.","I've had pets before that were on both sides of it, one example, one has a cage, she came home, stripped, had me put on her collar and just loved doing mundane things. She wasn't into it sexually so much as it was just a life choice that I was willing to help her indulge.\n\nAnother example I had one that wanted to be led on a leash, she loved being dominated and being told what to do. Her description of it was \" it's such a turn on to please you but also not have to think about it.\" \n\nThere is definitely a protective and dominate side and a submissive and trusting side. ","I may act stubborn and puppyish at times, but it's just for play. I personally love being dominated and bossed around, and when I'm playing puppy he's my daddy/master. \n\nHe makes me make him feel good, tells me to do things I wouldn't normally do and go outside my comfort zone. Sometimes he'll pet my head if I'm good, and my \"treat\" is his dick. \n\nI just like the fun, dominating aspect of it. Knowing he's in complete control, that my every action depends on him and him alone. It's amazing, and really shows how much we can trust each other.

I found an old Archie comic that inexplicably made my dick harder than anything ever had. Archie wanted to take Veronica out on a date, but was short on money. But Veronica was on a diet, so he knew she wouldn't order much, and it would be fine. Betty ruined the plan by tricking Veronica into thinking she had gotten too skinny and needed to gain weight. Veronica ends up ordering a lot of food and Archie can't pay the check.\n\nThis was when I learned that I was really turned on by the idea of weight gain. Let me be clear, it's not that I was attracted to fat girls. It was the gaining itself that excited me, not the outcome. The idea of a skinny girl being tricked into gaining weight, or WANTING to gain weight still turns me on like nothing else.","The day a friend pointed out to me that all my pursuits were older than me. I realized that I am very attracted to women older than me. ","Not my story but I think this is incredibly relevant.\n\nEver since I was a teenager I have had very intense fantasies about having sex with a giant roach.\nIt started in 9th or 10th grade when we read The Metamorphisis by Franz Kafka. As I started to think more and more about the roach creature that the character had become, I started to imagine what it would be like if a woman turned into the roach instead. I found this idea very arousing. I would not be repulsed or frightened of her, as the characters in the story are. I would take care of her. Then my thoughts started to get sexual with the character.\nEventually I sort of dropped the bit about her having been a human woman first, and I kind of imagined this fictionalized roach species. They are giant roaches, the size of a person, and have complete intelligence. I kind of over time conjured up an \"imaginary friend\" of sorts. She was one of these roaches and her name was Ogtha. I would fantasize about her often. Whenever I masturbated I'd be imagining elaborate scenarios of me and Ogtha making love.\nWhen I started to have actual sex, I found I could not, uh...perform, if I wasn't thinking of Ogtha. So basically now, anytime I have sex with a woman, I am pretending that she is actually Ogtha. Not just think about Ogtha, I concentrate intently to visualize that I actually am doing Ogtha. I don't want to think about the girl at all. There is only Ogtha.\nOf course this sex can never be as exciting as my fully imaginary sessions with Ogtha, there are things that her multiple appendages and antennae allow for that a human woman can never match.\n\n\n[Original post on /r/TIFU.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2i7jid/tifu_by_admitting_to_my_girlfriend_that_i_pretend)","Were you the guy on that show?

There is something strangely intimate about the act itself.  Typically going to pee (for an average person) is usually a rather private affair and a process that in itself isn't inherently sexual in any way.  But mostly it's the feeling the warm liquid feels spilling all over me that gets me.  I suppose its the fact that it's a normally a private process (which she is now sharing with me) and also something that was inside her body previously is now all over my body.  It's very hard to explain much like a lot of fetishes are, it's just inexplicably arousing and intimate (I suspect there is also a bit of a raw primal aspect to it as well).

Like, I really get off on a woman *needing* it and being a bit aggressive.\n\n**1)** I was 15, it was lunch, and I hung out with some friends and their friends who I didn't know. We entered a store, and one specific girl who just had a certain look that I enjoyed began acting really slutty in front of me. I can't remember most specifics, but she straight up bent over and jokingly told me to stick it in within minutes of meeting her as I was walking behind her (she had a skirt with shorts underneath). Anyways, we all hung out together and everyone could tell she wanted me, I had just dumped my ex and my best friend wanted me to become a \"bro\" again rather than a whipped bitch like I was, so he dared us to make out. We did, she got on top of me and began rubbing herself against my dick while everyone watched and took pictures, i sucked on her tits some and my friend sent those pictures to my ex, fucking her up pretty badly because he's just an asshole like that. So yeah, as much as I like to initiate &amp; dominate, I like an assertive female quite a lot.\n\n**2)** My ex got me really into bdsm (her sub, me dom) but the story isn't as interesting. We dated, I dumped her, talked to her again a few years later to see how she was and she told me how I ruined her life by dumping her and how she has to be dominated because that's all she's worth. Well, apparently she was experimenting with the idea of it when I started talking to her again and a guy was grooming her to be his sub, but I took over and she ditched him so we could explore it together. She was *really* into it. I had her greet me in certain positions, I could take her whenever/however I wanted, decide what she will wear, get her to masturbate in public while I'm not there (but not cum), etc...it was fucking amazing.\n\nI personally could never put myself in her position. She was a very jealous girl and hated other girls talking to me, but we discussed it and even though she'd hate every moment of it, she'd willingly watch me fuck other women if I wanted to. I never did, I'd consider that emotional abuse.","hot blonde college girlfriend. we both liked dancing, but i hadnt found swing yet, so i was always half frustrated and she was always trying to backlead. so i had this frustration with her that things werent going the way i wanted. \n\nearly morning and we had to be somewhere, she wanted to get ready, i wanted sex. so i ended up having rough sex for the first time. had to stop in the middle 3 times to make sure she was ok with it. \n\nIve since moved on to full rape fantasy (prearranged safeword) and other things with other girls.  dominating was sorta my natural state and its a lot more fun than being nice and gentle the whole time.

I had this study group I was with, that ended up as my core group of friends. Anyway we would always hang out in either one of two of the friend's apartments. Both weren't very big either so, not a lot of furniture. So we'd all end up sitting on either the coolers or the bed etc. I would usually sit on the bed, because my ass requires cushion, and I am not a savage who sits on the floor. This girl Cindy would usually sit on the bed with me, so we easily got to know each other better. Now this girl looked rather homely I suppose? She would always have her hair in a bun which I found unattractive, also a sports bra underneath her sweats which made her seem flat as an open soda bottle left out for a month. \n\n\nWell eventually I got more attracted to her, due to her personality than her looks. And on one particular night, while on the bed in a room filled with our friends. We got really frisky and ended up making out on the bed. And then the glorious moment when she decided to take off her sports bra. What I initially thought were no more than A cups turned into the most perfect C cups I have ever seen. And I fondled them for a little bit. We didn't have sex on the bed though. Considering there were about 7 - 8 people still in the room. However I immediately asked her out for a date the next day. \n\n\nAnd she was gorgeous on our date. No hair bun, no sweats, and good lord no sports bra. Simply amazing. The date itself was uneventful, however when we got back to her place. We were practically naked before we reached her room. But right before I jumped her, she told me to wait for a bit. Then she grabbed a kitchen chair from outside into her room. Told me to sit down, then proceeded to tie me up with some soft rope. I thought this was crazy sexy, as she rode me. Told me to tell her when I was about to cum. Right before I popped I left her know as commanded. She gave me this alluring look in her eye. Then began to choke the shit out of me. With no pre-choke warnings, I thought this was some silence of the lambs, buffalo bill kind shit going down. I almost broke the chair trying to untie myself. And threw her to the ground, I was very close to slapping the shit out of her too. All she replied was \"Did you like that? ;)\"\n\nI yelled back \" Are you crazy?\" Then Grabbed my stuff and left.

If you simply find it hot to fuck a lady who still has some clothing on, then it's incorrect to call it CFNM play. \n\nAlso, I don't really think that what you are describing can really be called \"bdsm\" as it is unclear to me if there is any power exchange involved in the scenario you are describing.","I can agree with the BDSM point, at least with the information the guy has given us so far, but your notion about CFNM seems off.\n\n\nLiking CFNM involves only enjoying the concept of having a clothed female and a naked male. Whilst it's common in power play, and almost a given in most pornographic material that is labelled as \"CFNM\", it's nigh on impossible to argue that \"Clothed Female, Naked Male\" *needs* to include anything but a clothed female and a naked male.","hm... my understanding of what CFNM means (generally in the scene)  is based on there being CFNM parties in my city that are high protocol, ie totally D/s-based events that take place in dungeons. The same is true of CMNF events. \n\nI can agree with you that simply leaving the woman clothed during sex need not necessarily indicate a power imbalance (indeed, there might just not have been time to take off all the woman's clothing... for whatever reason...)

I know she likes it rough so I intended to show her how easy it is to get your SO going when you actually try what they asked. When she came out I snuck up behind her, grabbed her so she couldn't move, through her on the couch and quickly tied her arms and legs. Like legit she couldn't get them off. I could tell her resistance was superficial and that she was more amazed than anything. When I finally worked my way down there, she was soaked.

A few years later and the internet introduces me to furries and I'm hooked. Just wish it wasn't so hated on the internet too, haha.","So, I was raised in a household where I never really felt like I had a voice. My parents always told me what to do, and I was an obedient son. The typical Asian parent lifestyle. \n\nFrom this, I started becoming sexually submissive. I would date girls that liked taking control, and would love the feeling of controlling me in sex. I didn't feel passion doing this, though, so I started trying it with guys. Seeing what it was like to be controlled by a male, and notice any differences. Maybe there was something better there. \n\nBut then, I realized something. The majority of doms and dommes that I experimented with were fucking awful. They only had the sexual interest, but didn't show enough of the emotion and passion that I realized I wanted. This pissed me off, and made me wonder why so many people call themselves dominant, when they're really just lazy people that don't know how to reciprocate sexually. (To be fair, I was probably just exposed to the wrong crowd, and I definitely believe there are many people out there that are great at being dominant, but sadly, I didn't experience it with you, I experienced it with these idiots.)\n\nI then made it my goal to try and be a Dom myself so I can show to myself that I know what a good Dom can do. The right amount of pain, the right amount of control, the right amount of understanding, but most importantly, the right amount of love and caring. This is where I realized I was actually a Dom. As I would take control, I would get such a sexual rush and feel amazing and empowered. It made me feel significant and useful. I realized that my upbringing hadn't just taken away my self sufficiency, it took away my feeling of usefulness. \n\nBut when I started exhibiting more dominant traits, especially with my current girlfriend, I feel complete. There's a sense of identity that I never realized was missing, and I now have it, especially in a sexual manner. From there, I've explored further with kinks, such as pinching, twisting, hot candle wax, ice, tying up, etc. My girlfriend and I have an amazing relationship where we acknowledge the two aspects. One is the actual communication, where we love talking to each other and being a part of each other's lives. The second is the sexual aspect, where no matter what, I'm in control, and unless the safe word is said, that doesn't change (with the mutual trust of course).\n\nI always thought of it as very weird to even look at BDSM in the beginning, but after experimenting more and more, it's become a regular part of my life, and it's made me feel like a much more powerful and significant person.","Or two.","I had never gone down on a girl, thought it was gross.\nSomehow i convinced myself to go for it.\nWow, that smell, drove me wild. I wanted it all.  The taste, the same.\nThen she started prelubricating, it just became slicker and slicker.\nThen she starts responding, she never moaned before.  So i mind map her erogenous zones.\nAfter this effort, I'm addicted to eating pussy, clit, g-spot, and getting her to orgasm. ","Hospital socks....","You need the safe word. ","Or just people in general.","So I am a former (5 years clean) meth user, and something the average joe may not know about meth is that you often become incredibly aroused, which in turn often leads to sexual shenanigans for many, many hours.

Ok fast forward about 3 years when my mother developed agoraphobia and I didn't leave the house for 3 years. I found the internet (and reddit) and I was able to escape my prison by going online! Here is where my story gets kinda strange, I discovered furries and furry porn long before I found real porn. I still cant explain how this happened. There it  was one day, furries eating each other. I got that familiar awkward feeling, only then I knew I was being turned on by it. I knew from that day forward that I loved Voraphilia.

I remember trying to escape, but she held me back and forced me back into the chair I was sitting in. That feeling of complete powerlessness was the coolest thing that I'd ever felt.

(As in, we've done various things that end up with us cumming, it's just that fucking hasn't been one of those activities.)\n\nAnyway, she was telling me about something her boyfriend did to her once, with her consent. (It's important to stress this was consensual and planned in advance.) He spiked her drink with something to knock her out, I can't remember what. It wasn't so strong she passed out immediately, but it didn't take too long (maybe 45 minutes or an hour at most) ... she just remembers being so tired she couldn't stay awake and went to bed super early.\n\nAfter she was completely unconscious, her boyfriend started filming her and then fucked her while she was unconscious. Apparently, he really went to town on her. He cleaned her up as best he could then sent her the video as a surprise email the next day.\n\nAlso, she didn't know exactly when this would happen (which is what she wanted) and her boyfriend apparently waited almost a month before actually doing it, so she had no idea it was happening that specific night.  I remember she said something seemed weird when she woke up the next day because she felt like there was still some lube on her, so she sort of thought he might have done it the night before, but wasn't sure until she got the email.\n\nApparently, this video was her favorite thing to masturbate to for weeks after it happened.\n\nShe actually told me once I could do the same thing to her if I wanted, but I'm not sure if she was serious or not and I sure as hell am not doing something like that if I'm not 100% positive she's serious. I don't think she was, though.\n\n","I've been into choking since I became at all sexually active, and that sort of thing kind of escalates as you get older, imo.

","Great. I now have a barrel fetish.","There was a girl in high school who was into me, but I was not really into her. We both knew the situation, and I shouldn't have gotten involved, but I totally did. She and I pushed boundaries a lot. For example, I'd show up in the auditorium during her drama class, and walk off sidestage pretending to be setting something up... she'd excuse herself and follow, and as soon as we were around the corner - still wildly exposed, mind you, but not where anyone happened to be standing - I'd facefuck her until I came, then I'd zip up and leave. This culminated in her going ass to mouth in the lobby of the auditorium one day during class. All doors open, anyone could have come in. I left her naked on the floor, covered in cum. Which was stupid, really, we could have been expelled, or worse. But as most people here can probably attest, I wasn't really thinking. Freshman year, I'd already discovered I was a mildly sadistic, dominant, exhibitionist, with a penchant for rough blowjobs and anal.\n\n\nI ran into her later in life, she had also discovered her many and opposing kinks during that period, but fortunately had found a much healthier relationship to explore them in.","Thank you.

I saw \"Electrosluts\", thought it was a Sybian thing where the woman is crying and sweating and collapsing from orgasm after orgasm (a secondary kink of mine for sure), and clicked it. \n\nIt was electroshock fetish porn.

When the sub had that dildo in her mouth held by a strap around her head, and the dom was riding it, orgasming to the sub's muffled noises, I blew the best masturbatory orgasm of my life.\n\nAnd that's how I found out my kink is to fuck a woman who is currently or just recently finished dominating another woman, preferably with electroshock. Unfortunately, I didn't know about the existence of this kink when I had a girlfriend who experimented with other girls with me.

Here is my story.\n\nI've been with the same guy for 5 years, going on 6. He's my first and only. Sex started out crazy. We live in a rural area that has an open high school campus. The campus is pretty big. We lost our virginity one night during a football game near the theater and band classrooms behind a water tower.  You could hear people rushing by to the band classroom since the marching band was about to play, and the thought of getting caught had us so turned on. That's one kink we're still both into. We climaxed when the band started playing. \n\nWe continued experimenting. Within the first year we already tried anal and we both love it. That's kink number two.\n\nIt wasn't until our third year we discovered kink number three. We went through a time where we didn't see each other much, he was working a lot and I was finishing my last year in high school and dealing with college applications. Usually, we fuck like rabbits, so by the time we see one another, we're tearing clothes off, forcefully kissing, and knocking over anything getting in our way. It was hot. So, he throws me down on his bed and loses his balance a bit trying to shake off his left pant leg and he catches himself by placing his hand down next to me. He misses and I have his hand over my throat. That's when we discovered I like it rough and being submissive. He likes to dominate and it turns him on how much I get off on it. We haven't had the time yet, but we want to further that kink with toys and bondage.\n\nSo far, we've tried deep-throating (which I love, and is a recent discovery), fisting (don't like it. We tried it and neither enjoy it), prostate play, I let him experience someone else (but, he didn't like it. \"She didn't do it right\"). I don't want to experience anyone else, but like to watch), and so many toys. \n\nI'm excited to try new things.

When we finally got our own place, I would wear the ski mask with my snow pants, coat, boots and gloves. There was something about being covered from head to toe that I liked.

I started looking for similar content and eventually stumbled on the entire hotwife/cuckold fetish.\n\nI'm not into humiliation at all (the cuckold thing), but now that I've had about 10 years to explore it, the idea (and reality) of my wife enjoying other men is a huge turn on.\n\n","&gt;*The internet was a mistake* ~ /u/ICYURNVS86\n\n-Hayao Miyazaki","hey fella http://imgur.com/gallery/caMm6N8","I have been into kink starting at least age 5. I remember a project my Kindergarten class and I completed in which we were to draw a picture which they were going to make a photo plate out of. At that point, I was into robots. I drew my typical 5 year old robot but I added something. I don't remember the inspiration other than it made me feel good back then. Not sexually, but something else. Neverthe less, I added two quick lines to shackle this robot to the wall, preventing its escape. I remember being proud of this robot. I also remember being confronted by both my mother and my teacher as these quite out of place lines being on this robot picture. That was the first time I remember feeling guilty, ashamed, or not right. I explained them away as \"power bracelets\" somehow coming out of my 5 year old mind (not to sound narcissistic, but I have always been advanced).\n\nI write this as it sums up pretty much my experience with the scene throughout my life. It has always been a secret. I have spent not only hours, but I am guess years of my life now looking at BDSM related pornography, was an avid member of INSEX back in the day, and can remember the first day cable internet was available in my house so I could finally absorb the content my mind and my sexuality wanted so badly.\n\nI never really engaged in the lifestyle during my younger years. Tieing a girls hands up here or there with whatever was lying around. Extremely mild. I had suppressed everything which had turned me on for decades. No communities existed like this, or at least I never knew they did. I was so, so, so jealous of everyone who was in this.\n\nI then got married! Yep, she was vanilla. Extremely vanilla. I love her though. Love her more than most could hope to care for another human being. I loved being around her, loved the sex, and we created a family. Around about two years ago basically after our first son was born, something happened. I guess the years of repression led to something. I felt completely unsatisfied. I had a beautiful young baby boy, a beautiful wife, a spectacular job I loved....but something was missing.\n\nIt began to eat at me. I don't know why then or why. It just ate and ate and ate at me. I began to isolate in various ways from her. I would game late into the night. I would materbate to the pornography which I so wanted into my life. Rinse repeat.\n\nThings started to go downhill. Fast. I mean really fast. Many fights about my disengagement. Was it her looks? Of course not! She is amazingly hot. The baby was great and the joy of my life. Work was fine. But still, I felt incomplete. Unwhole. I felt like I was mourning my life and trying to accept the thought that I would never get to engage in this lifestyle I so wanted.\n\nI never wanted to tell her. Despite her being my best friend, my partner, my lover, and a great mother. I thought in my mind I couldn't. I was afraid she would run. She would hide. She would think I was a freak, strange, and look at me differently. I was willing to cut this major piece of my sexuality out of my life to maintain the relationship I wanted so much. It was taking its toll though, as you can see.\n\nOne night, when we both had had a few adult beverages, I finally (after 10 years) began to describe to her what I liked. I put it all on the line (at least I thought it was). Fuck it. This secret was ruining my world, and her's, and it was time.\n\nIt went AMAZINGLY. Like beyond awesome. Like I should have done it 10 years earlier. I underestimated her. I laid it on on the line. We watched some of my favorite pornography. I know that is not representative of true life, but it was a starting point! She let me know what looked like she was comfortable with, and I told her what I was not into. It was life changing.\n\nLike I said, she has always been vanilla. Although, to sum up another 20 pages of information, she has always wanted to please. She has a natural \"sub\" stance within herself which we began to tap into.\n\nSo now to present date. A year later...\n\nWe have hours long \"scenes\" at least once a week. We, well more I, have dropped thousands into gear. We have tested what fits, we like, what it looks like, etc. We did it together. I can honestly say I feel complete. 100% satisfied.\n\nI do need help though. I have always enjoyed the bondage side of things. I have always loved the control aspect of having another tied, with the inability to escape, and the sheer power differential. I love tying her up in different ways, strapping her down, etc. That is my favorite. Second would be the forced orgasm. Much more of a fallacy with us, but we can do it! I love the sensation of forcing others to orgasm while tied up, over...and over...and you get the point. Lastly, I do enjoy flogging or various traditional impact play at times. I have not been huge on the punishment, but do like utilizing it as a way to show just how helpless she is and just how much control I am in. I hope that all makes sense.","Have you seen Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt? The bunker scenes would basically be porn for you. ","Hahaha, I do love me some old fashioned stuff.

A big part of Domination is psychological Domination. Scenes draw that out and keep the bottom from going too deep into 'subspace'. Don't get me wrong, subspace isn't necessarily a bad thing, but subs can go too deep and lose themselves. The Dom has to keep them aware and awake during or their eyes will glaze over and it is just a beating at that point because the sub is in lala-land; the sub is having all the fun and the Dom is doing all of the work. \n\nSo, in short, scenes allow the sub to participate and feed the Dom power that they then use to give the sub what they want, that ecstatic feeling of not having any control over the situation. ","&gt;subs can go too deep and lose themselves\n\nthat is weapons-grade bullshit","It absolutely isn't. It's like a trance state. It isn't hard to break, but when the goal is interaction it is counterproductive. If a sub stops responding, a Dom is going to ask them if they're doing ok. The whole point of BDSM is for a Dom to have their subject aware, at all times, that they are giving up control. Otherwise, it is just a beating. \n\nAs to the original topic of kink and subs being demeaned; some people are just into that. It doesn't make them good or bad Doms/subs.","&gt; The whole point of BDSM is for a Dom to have their subject aware, at all times, that they are giving up control. Otherwise, it is just a beating.\n\nI don't necessarily agree with this. A lot of BDSM is very subjective. It's all about what individual Doms and subs want, how things work between them, etc. A Dom doesn't necessarily have to keep their sub aware and if the sub drifts off that does not mean the control has been surrendered. There's different levels and different subs experience their space differently. Also, if they eventually fall deep into a sub space that doesn't suddenly render the whole scene just a beating, and plenty of Doms don't consider beating a sub just work, many love and get plenty of pleasure from it.","You clearly have no understanding (and possibly no experience) of D/s relationships or genuine BDSM activity if you're going to make such utterances, and I would suspect the same goes for most of those who've upvoted you.

He looks beyond me to Cheryl's desk and says \"gross, check it out\". I look over, and she had taken off her shoes and had her feet up on her desk. To me, that was shocking. I certainly could never do that. I obsessed over not being able to do that. But there were her feet just exposes for everyone to see. To me at that time it was nearly like she was naked. She was definitely exposed more that I could even fathom to be. I couldn't stand up for a while, and I didn't even have a sweater to tie around my waist! \n\nWelcome to my  foot kink.

Or, rather, that's the throbbing rationalization they use.","\"throbbing rationalization\" is my new nickname for... well... you know","Does the bible specifically mention vaginal sex in a way that it's obviously to the exclusion of other types of penetrative intercourse?","You obviously haven't spent much time in Catholic countries, especially Latin American ones: this is an extremely common attitude and, while I share your ridicule from a theological perspective, as an atheist and an enthusiastic fan of anal sex, I support it 100%. ","Actually, I was raised very Catholic (went to church every Sunday, rain or snow, until I went off to Uni). My parents always stressed that premarital sex is a bad idea because it's dangerous considering I could knock up a girl in highschool [I guess still can ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ) ], or possibly get an STD. It wasn't really ever about it being unholy, but a risky move if I'm not ready to pay the consequence.\n\nThat is also what I have grown to believe is the **basis** of this principle. Now however, it seems the people that were blindly taught premarital sex is bad just impose it onto their kids with the justification that God wouldn't want that, which I think is unlikely.","I guess that is a significant problem with many such issues: things which originally (from an atheist perspective) were developed with social stability in mind end up becoming mere dogma.","I went to a catholic school and know two girls who did anal first because they were convinced having piv sex was a sin and anal wasn't .","A married couple I was friends with brought me in because the husband liked to watch his wife with other guys. At one point during one particular night night he wanted to join in, so he ran upstairs and came back down with a bunch of scarves, nylons, etc. and proceeded to tie her up; hands behind her back, blindfolded. And then we double teamed her. Apparently this was her kink, but holy shit did it ever work for me too. I had no idea, my sex life was as vanilla as you can get prior to that. We still hook up every once in a while and it's always great. Also she likes being bitten, and I like biting, which is just super.

He did let me dress him in drag and tie him up though.  So the most vanilla sex I ever had involved bondage and forced crossdressing and makeup.

These are my sex socks.\"","How else would you get your socks off?","my very first girlfriend and i, when we were 13 and 14, was strangely into being dominated and insulted. it evolved from little things like spanking and being ordered around to slapping her in the face and calling her a stupid little whore. i was bewildered and extremely aroused. then she fucked some other dude and had him do the same thing 2 weeks after we broke up, and i wasn't so confused as to why she liked it anymore. had a kink for it ever since.","Plot twist - he doesn't have a dog","Plot twist - He actually has a cat. ","I realised even in primary school that if I played up how upset or in pain I was, that my lovely teacher would pay me attention and let me sit on her knee until I was feeling better. So I've always known that I like nurturing, motherly women. \n\nIt was only when I was 18, and while talking to a beautiful older woman during the day in a pub garden, and she made it clear that had assumed I was in school with her much younger daughter that I realised how much I liked to be mistaken for someone younger. I had thought I was chatting her up, she thought I was a sweet boy being polite to her daughter's mum. Something about the way that immediately knotched me down a few pegs is really captivating to me.","Doubt anyone will see this but anyway: \n\nIn general I seem like a calm and agreeable person on the surface. While I do prefer being around people who get along, my mind never shuts off. That has both positives and negatives. I never stop thinking of ways to help those I care about or do fun things but my insecurities never go away either.\n\nI have a physical disability from birth, effecting my legs. Its not the mobility challenges that are the hardest part. It's how other people perceive you for it, and oftentimes the vanillas don't even think we can have sex, never mind being good partners. I'm in my early 20s now but was forced to use a Walker at school for six and a half years which did a real number on my self-esteem. It's taken me years of self-healing to feel that I am not just the ugly Walker freak. I don't seek kink to compensate for what my legs cannot do, I seek it for its creativity which all people with disabilities need to make relationships work. \"Seeing past\" the disability is ignorant. We can't turn them off so neither should you. Acknowledge and adapt. Also if I walk into a munch people there assume I'm able and intelligent enough for the physical parts of BDSM. As opposed to some vanillas who don't even think we want/need/can do it.\n\nWhere do specific kinks come into this? During my years of feeling like no woman would want me, I thought of a relationship and sex as a gift between a couple. To me, the ultimate satisfaction is getting my partner off, and knowing I made them feel good. The snarling Domme in porn does nothing for me. I crave a Sensual/Thrall Domme, in exchange for love my priority is her satisfaction which becomes satisfying to me. Morticia Addams drew me in on some level as a kid, I just didn't realize why until recently. The fact that I liked obeying and compliments from the female teachers/EAs? I thought at the time they were just being nice to me out of Walker pity but they actually liked me as a student and I got a thrill earning their approval. Teacher role-play is still a big fantasy of mine. If I find one who also likes to be a Domme, dreams do come true!\n\nTo be told how to make her feel good and praised for it; wonderful peace for an over thinker like me. No worrying about how people might be judging me, no worrying that I'm lesser to other guys-she chose me and told me what she likes. Grabbing the back of my neck to place me where she wants? Being the man she feels safe with at the end of the day to rub her sore feet/legs? The person she wears her sexy gear for and orders around? The person that gets to create all the lady juice that makes her feel good on a primal level? All are gifts to me. To be called a Good Boy after doing something right and seeing her happiness I caused; practically an emotional/mental orgasm for me. And I can see value in providing the same as a Dom, so a Switch I am. To give and receive all the motions of a healthy kink relationship perhaps including subspace, perfect way to express love.","Do you have Cerebral Palsy? I hope you don't mind me asking but your second paragraph reminded me of a lot of my own thoughts and feelings with my CP","Yep! If you want to talk, go ahead!

I couldn't even bring myself to tell them I liked them back then, but it was pretty obvious. I wanted THEM to tell ME that they like me - I was ashamed to ever admit I liked girls or that I want someone else.\n\nAnyway, at 19 or so I have my first real-life girlfriend (I had online relationships for years, but they eventually fell through). But that, as well as the two after that, ended in my girlfriend eventually getting with someone else and disappearing.\n\nSo yeah...\n\nI have a cuckold fetish now. I get off on being teased (or really just downright insulted, I guess) and seeing my girlfriend sleep around and be a slut. Especially if she's really hot physically - but I don't think I'd give up the bliss of being single for any other kinda girl. You have to be pretty impressive to pry me from my sheltered lonely life.\n\nBut don't get me wrong - it only works from a girlfriend. Some random asshole tries to assert \"his dominance\" over me and he's gonna have a hell of a bad time. Bullying as a kid also made me bottle up a lot of hate and gain a lot of prejudice for assholes, so I'll unload on you pretty fucking quick and not care about the consequences.\n\nAll in all, I think I'm just a flat-out pretty disturbed person. Lots of bullying and abuse leads to you just being generally twisted and abnormal.

Depending on his mood, he might be Steve or Stephanie. I banged both of them, but it was so much hotter when he was presenting as a woman.

I put a pillow between my head and her lap and put my arms under the pillow, as you would when you're sleeping on your stomach.  I ended up rubbing her pussy when she directed my hand up her thigh.  After that, every time she wanted me to massage her back, she would always lead my hands down her pants. \n\nFeet: my girlfriend in high school was my first ever.  I did everything with her.

In our drunken sleep, I confessed to her I always fantasized about her.  Her leg was hanging off the couch and while we were talking about this, I slowly caressed her leg and led it to my dick.

I'm fucking weird, man.","I don't know whose inbox is going to get hammered more, you or the woman who said she's into fat dudes.","Ahaha. That's quite alright. I could go to my local dive bar at around 3pm and have my pick of the litter but I'm not accepting applications at the moment. My current fuck buddies are repulsive enough to fulfill my needs.","I find it all very interesting I must say, and I've got some questions if you'll indulge my curiosity. Are you exclusively into these undesirable men or do you also date people that are more conventionally attractive and closer to your age? What is you age/undesirability limit? Are you turned on by your own feelings of repulsion or more by the reactions of other people?","I'll answer as best as I can. For starters, I think it is a form of masochism. Being fucked by someone twenty thousand leagues under, well, your league is a demeaning experience. I get off on being demeaned.\n\nExclusively into unattractive, old men? For the most part. Once in a blue moon I'll bang a good looking guy my age, but I don't get that same \"rush\". I've had some attractive men try to court me and I have to let them down real gentle. \n\nMy age limit is probably around 70. My oldest was 64. I'm also not too opposed to good looking older men, but the unattractive ones really get me going. I'm very liberal but I'm into banging uptight conservatives. Now, if they are overwhelmingly racist or homophobic or sexist I dismiss them completely. That's where I draw the line. Fuck people like that. They don't deserve 23 year old pussy.\n\nI am turned on my a combination my own repulsion and other people's. The weird looks and constant gossip are just an added bonus. I do have a hard time making female friends because of it. They (the women in the bar scene or the work place) call me a tramp and consider me to be relatively cold because I don't join in with their chihuahua-like yapping and hugs. I just want to read my books and fuck when I go out. Because of how I am, I spend alot of time alone and friendless which suits me perfectly.","Do you ever tell your partners that you're attracted to them *because* they're revolting? There would be so many conflicting emotions! On one hand, ouch, on the other, \"doesn't matter had sex.\"","Noooooooo. I never tell them they are revolting; they already know they are. I listen to their not-so-internal monologues about why on earth I would persue them. I tell them that they are wonderful in my eyes because, honestly, every awful, disgusting asshole you meet is a human being who was once a child, has gone through shit, has loved, has felt loss, etc. And getting to know someone everybody hates and avoids is a surprisingly rewarding experience.\n\nKinda like the dynamic between the fat Asian kid and the old man in that kids movie \"Up\", but with more alcoholism and doggystyle sex in the back of a Jeep Cherokee.","You sound like a really cool person. I am so enthralled by your story, thoughts, feelings, and attitudes. I live a similar lifestyle. ","Thank you. I needed to hear that right now. I stumbled into a Tupperware party at a bar last night with some of the bitchy women I know and just felt completely out of place.","Tupperware parties are for prudes. ","Interesting, thanks for taking the time to answer. It honestly seems to be a pretty beneficial arrangement for all parties provided that these men don't see through what you're doing and get upset, though I suppose the prospect of sleeping with someone who is way younger than them and way out of their league, as you say, may make your motives moot to them. Have you ever had that happen to you? It seems like it could become a safety issue if you upset the wrong person. \n\nAs far as what the bar flies and gossip hens think, screw 'em.","I am very very clear about not wanting a commitment, just a \"buddy\". Alas, often times they get this idea on their heads that they are going to be the one to make me finally \"settle down\". Nope. Sorry. I don't like waking up next to people, I require a ton of alone time, I can't maintain lasting relationships with anyone, I need solitude. They inevitably \"fall in love\" with the watered down version of myself I present to the world and they get their hearts broken that way. I always warn them though. Always.\n\nI have upset the wrong people. Bosses, co-workers, men with tempers, the chief of police, men in weak emotional states. I coast through it though. Maybe I am cold hearted.","your inbox is about to be destroyed ","Actually, no. My inbox has been very mellow.","I dunno. Out of 300 odd girls at my school, at least three seemed to have this kink.

I would daydream in class about being in some of those torture devices and having my clit rubbed. I've had that particular kink (there are others) ever since.","I'm not gay but umm... I find feminine traps to be much more attractive than females. This all started one hot afternoon when I was home alone as a highschool boy, browsing the interwebs and reading some hentai doujinshi. There, I came across a very cute cover, and thinking it was just a petanko, I started reading. Oh I was quite wrong, but, no regrets. 10/10 would fap again to it. \n\nSo \"traps\" had become a regular fap category for me now, and all the traps were drawn with pleasured faces from getting their asses fucked, so I started going down that road as a curious boy.

There's a common narrative that trans people are lying, and that if you find yourself attracted to a woman and then discover she's trans, the appropriate response is violence. The idea that they're \"traps\", ensnaring innocent straight men into unintentional homosexuality (because, of course, these people don't accept that trans women *are* women) is definitely prevalent, and definitely feeds into the violence faced by so many trans people, particularly trans women.\n\n---\n\nI would say that \"insensitive slang terms\" are a problem in general, but \"trap\" is *definitely* and *specifically* a problem, and the ideas behind it are *directly responsible* for much of the violence aimed at trans women.","Ehh I say traps and don't feel the need to murder transgender's because I think that way ","#i'm so triggered by your use of your male pronouns. /s","Don't know why you a getting downvoted, I had a good laugh.","One of the first girls I showed my penis to, giggled and said aww look how cute and little it is.","Um...happy cakeday?","Reddit was a mistake"," The vocalist in my band does that the make me uncomfortable.

There's a lot of reasons, probably, but no one wants to hear me tell my life story. Point is, I don't get jealous. My long-time, one-tax-filing-way-from-common-law-married, girlfriend doesn't either, apparently. So, open relationship.\n\nAnyways, she boned her married friend from work who is much older than us. Which resulted in long series of socially awkward moments that I find **fucking hilarious.** He, of course, doesn't want his wife to find out. His wife loves the idea of my girlfriend and I being their younger protege friend couple and invites us over for dinner all the time. I get to see him be stressed out about his wife and this chick he banged being in the same room. He also doesn't know that I know he banged my girlfriend. I think he's cool and enjoy his company, but not nearly as much as I enjoy him trying to keep his cool around me because he has weird guilt feelings about nailing my girlfriend. On top of that, his wife is an ex-Orthodox Jew who has lived life surrounded by Christians and observing them from the outside, and I'm a pagan raised in a Catholic family, so I love talking religion with his wife, and we'll get a few beers in us and just really get to chatting. So then I get to see him nervous about me hitting it off with his wife.\n\nTL;DR Let your girlfriend have an \"affair\" with a married dude, because the discomfort of guilty people is hilarious.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, my girlfriend is uncomfortable around the wife, because she feels bad about enabling him to cheat on her, and is terrified she's gonna find out and get hostile.","Out of curiousity, do you feel invested in your relationship? Feels like you are talking like an outsider.","I'm invested as hell. I'll light a motherfucker on fire for saying an unkind word about my girlfriend. She's the first girl I've been with that spending the rest of my life together doesn't sound like a prison sentence, and I'm fairly certain at this point that one of us will die before we break up.\n\nOn the other hand, I have a dark sense of humor and am greatly amused by seeing people feel guilty about a thing I don't see as a big deal. Especially when some of that guilt is directed at me and I don't feel at all like I've been wronged.\n\nI don't personally see a big deal in people smashing their monkey parts together. But humans love finding things to feel guilty about.","I think the big deal isn't the smashing monkey parts together, it's the normative structure that some parties (mainly, it seems, the wife) want to uphold. So the husband's infidelity, his paranoia about that and your wife's guilt are not for nothing. The sex itself may be insignificant to you, but the breaking of trust in this case is nonetheless manipulative.","Your points are totally valid and I recognize them as such. I don't specifically condone cheating. It's not okay, period. Don't do things with your junk that your partner isn't comfortable with. That's why my girlfriend feels guilty for her part. \n\nBut, I wasn't wronged in any way, my partner didn't do anything that violates the trust we specifically have between us. So I'm in a unique position to watch people freak out about a thing that I personally don't find bothersome.","Well I'm gesturing at something else. Namely, even though sex outside relationships doesn't bother you, your attitude towards it comes off as problematic. You don't seem to regard yourself as culpable in this situation, even though you could easily be regarded as equally \"enabling\". Moreover, it simply amuses you even though you know that if the wife finds out, she'll be in a lot of pain. By pointing out the ways in which this situation is troubling, I was pointing to how you ought to realise your part in it.","I'm not culpable at all. My girlfriend's decision to have sex with this dude, and his decision to have sex with her, were both made without any consultation from me. I probably would have advised against it. My amusement almost entirely derives from the two of them sweating about the consequences of a decision they made and have to live with now.\n\nIf my impression of the wife's attitudes gave me any indication this would end in heartbreak, I'd be a lot less comfortable about it. But the dude is basically a trophy husband she keeps on a leash, and in conversation she acts like the infidelity of men is a bygone conclusion, a misbehavior to be punished and corrected, like leaving the toilet seat up.\n\nI could talk for hours about all the layers of reasons this shit is amusing to me. Yes, I'll admit there's a touch of the sociopath in my amusement, but it's really not as dark and evil as you seem to think it is.","Well, detail always helps - such as the info you just posted, which puts it into context. Your original post, sparse as it was on those details, did make you seem quite cold. Like: \"these mortals with their old fashioned morals\". Or like a high-minded anthropologist. ","In no sense is he \"equally 'enabling'\": the fact that he has an open relationship does not make him responsible for his partner's actions any more than if their relationship were ostensibly monogamous and she were cheating on him. As for his finding the situation amusimg: well, he admits he has a dark sense of humour. That does *not*, however, mean that he would take pleasure in watching the wronged wife  suffer were she to find out. That he finds a degree of amusement in watching the cheating husband squirm is a very different thing (and, I think, one with which more than a few people, myself included, could identify). You seem to be judging him for sins (I am using that in a secular sense) which he hasn't actually committed: the \"part\" which you are urging /u/LordWheezel to realise is in fact only that of an onlooker, and unless you are suggesting that he inform the wife of what has happened (which to my mind would be a terrible thing to do) I am not entirely sure how you think he should behave differently. ","There's a number of things I find problematic about what you've said here.\n\n&gt;If my impression of the wife's attitudes gave me any indication this would end in heartbreak, I'd be a lot less comfortable about it.\n\nThe poster himself concedes he wouldn't be as simply amused by this were it not for the fact that the wife involved would not actually be that harmed by it. There are sins of commission as much as omission, and sometimes simply being party to something committed opens up responsibility over it, depending on how you go on. If you omit to do anything, then you can begin to be responsible. \n\nI think it's fair to say that he shouldn't go mouthing off about it, but I do think, were the situation different (i.e., were the wife set to be truly harmed by it), he should arrange with his own wife that she not indulge the other guy's adulterous desires. That's a pretty standard norm among swingers, indeed: play with married men only if their wives consent to it. \n\nThen there's the other issue not brought up yet, which is whether it's ethical to watch the guy sweat because he thinks he's screwing your wife behind your back. Sure, we can smirk at his douchebaggery, but the truth is that many in that position are harangued internally by guilt. And this guy might have that on two fronts. The more compassionate thing to do is not to indulge his desires and further that guilt, or perhaps to signal that you know. There's a measure of the poster taking advantage of a bad situation for personal gains, and that does leave a bad taste in the mouth.","Thanks for responding. I didn't even think about the sex with another person thing, just the way you described the scene caught my eye.\n\nGlad you found someone you feel that way about, makes life that much more amazing","&gt; just the way you described the scene caught my eye.\n\nYour observations aren't off, just the reasoning you thought of. I observe human behavior as an outsider, but it's got a lot more to do with a life time of Asperger's than it does my relationship status.","I don't think that is neither healthy, nor you actually feel that way. It sounds to me like you were put into that situation, and you're trying to see the fun side. But anyways, if that is actually fine with you, have at it, man.","I was raised by nudist swingers. I simply wasn't brought up in a way that placed monogamy as a moral imperative. I don't have any conditioning to make my partner having sex with someone else to be a thing I'm bothered by. I understand why it bothers other people, so I don't go around banging other people's partners without their okay, it's just simply not a thing that bothers me.","How did your parents break it out to you they were swingers? must be awkward as fuck. ","It's one of those things that around puberty you start to pick up on the signs, and eventually, when you're old enough they just start being honest about it. It's not like they sat me down at age 12 to talk about the birds and the bees and the ants and the cats. It's more like around 16 or 17 they stop deflecting because they know you know.\n\nYeah, there's some awkward moments. Coming home from the Army on leave once (I was about 20 or so) my dad said something like, \"We're going to party. I'd bring you along, some of the ladies would love a young soldier boy, but your stepmom says she'd feel weird about you being there, so... there's leftovers and beer in the fridge, I guess.\" You know, just weird moments where in the back of your head you can hear the Jerry Springer theme song. But for the most part, it's pretty much like anyone else's childhood.","I'm the same way. I've always had a mid to low sex drive. My ex had a really high sex drive so we both got increasingly frustrated since she wasn't being satisfied and I hated the pressure to perform at her level. I floated the idea of an open relationship from early on but right away she thought something was wrong with me for being okay with her banging other dudes. Which I don't understand because if sex is the only thing that defines your relationship, you're not a couple, *you're fuck buddies*. \n\nYou would think more couples would wake up to the fact that having a fuck buddy on the side is beneficial to your intimate relationship. The divorce rate is 50% for a reason. Nobody wants to have sex with one person the rest of their life. Nobody. \n\nAs for what you're saying about him not knowing that you know...that is fucking amazing. You should start slipping subtle hints about the idea of cheating and open relationships to see if he has an \"oh fuck\" moment in front of you.\n\n&gt;I'm a pagan raised in a Catholic family\n\nThat's something you don't see everyday. How...what made you convert to paganism?","I get it though.  Most cannot entertain the idea of an open/poly relationship because of the jealousy factor playing on one's insecurities, not to mention mostly everyone is trained on the idea that you're only supposed to love one person.","At the age of nine or so, I laid down my case to my mother for why none of this shit made any sense to me. Also, how if the God being described to me was real, He was terrifying and alien at best, or shifty and untrustworthy at worst. She was pretty cool about it and said, \"Okay, but you still have to go to Mass with Grandma on the major holidays.\"\n\nAround age 14 or so, I did the thing that put the final nail in the coffin of my Christianity. I actually read the Bible. The glaring differences in tone between the Old and New Testaments was a big red flag, and I started reading about the history of it all, and eventually came to the conclusion that modern Christianity is all a really bizarre Judaism fan club. A bunch of people trying really hard to get in on someone else's heritage-based religion, without having to do any of the hard parts of that religion.\n\nI drifted around, experimenting with other stuff. Had a Wiccan phase for a while, but it was all feel-good, New Age fluff, and I was irritated by the people claiming to be the \"oldest religion\" when it was really invented in the '50s. Buddhism never stuck. Sikhism was philosophically fascinating, but had restrictions on human behavior I couldn't get behind. I eventually started looking at the religions of people I could call ancestors, and kind of settled into Norse Paganism.\n\nMy Norse Paganism is basically a thin veneer painted over what I would call a \"soft atheism.\" I don't believe in a one-eyed man riding an eight-legged horse around, or a red-bearded dude swinging a lightning hammer around, any more than I believe a Jewish lich used cleric magic to save us all from the wrath of his own father. I just find comfort in stories and legends of my ancestors, and find the moral lessons taught in those stories to be valid. And the fact that they're just stories and metaphors, not **The Direct Word of Gawd** means I can dismiss the ones I see as not really applicable to modern life, and don't need to feel guilty about not holding up certain ancient traditions, like human sacrifice and sailing to another country to kill people for gold and grains.","just one question: the first time she fucked another guy, was it something you proposed and approved, or something she did and you found out?","Generally, there are two kinds of open relationships:\n\n**Type 1:** From the beginning, or early on, both people talk about their boundaries and come to the conclusion neither is bothered by the other person's sexual activity. (Usually, there are ground rules, I'll get to that in a moment.)\n\n**Type 2:** People who are naturally monogamous try to save a failing relationship by making it open. There are lots of reasons people think this will work, but they're almost always wrong, and these relationships almost always fail shortly thereafter.\n\n**Ground rules:**\nMost people have rules and boundaries they need to make their life make sense and be manageable. My girlfriend and I have two rules:   1. Use protection with other people.\n2. Each partner has veto powers. You have the right to forbid the other partner from having sex with specific people. For me, this means if we meet a dude I think she has more than a 2% chance of boning in the future, but I find him annoying and am repulsed by the idea of sharing my girlfriend with him, I let her know he's off limits when we get a moment alone. For her, this is mostly just a blanket rule against any of my ex-girlfriends and one of her co-workers she really hates.\n\n**Anticipating another question you might have:**\nMost people in open relationships don't just run around screwing anything with a pulse. I've been with my girlfriend for coming up on six years now. And she's screwed one guy, gave a blowjob to another guy, we've had two threesomes (both of them with the same girl), and I've drunkenly made out with two or three girls at parties. Spread out over six years, that means we don't even qualify for a Cinemax After Dark movie, much less a crazy porno.","So you've never had sex with another girl (just the two of you)? isn't this a bit one sided?","Ah, the adrenaline boner.","Life goals.","I knew I recognized you from somewhere.

In general the vast majority of porn films of any genre are more about what you see than what they make you feel. Porn is literally just enough plot to give a reason to what people fuck, do whatever else, and look good doing it. Now femdom porn on the other hand (and the problem is not isolated to just that genre) is almost completely about the acting. Suddenly you can't have just any giant pair of tits half-ass some lines and look good. The target market really wants to see someone who carries themselves a certain way on both the giving and the receiving ends.\n\nAs far as the other problem of wrapping it all into one I can just mention what I've seen before. Relatively speaking the market for dominate females, pegging, sissy, sph and whatever else is really small. So for example you make a gentle femdom production (for example a generally aggressive female sans all the ropes and leather) you don't stand to make much money because the market is small. So what's happened is they basically took anything remotely related and wrapped it all into one thing. There's a large enough market out there that likes one or more items and also tolerates the rest that now you're making bank. It's seriously economics or at least it's the economics that are known.\n\nSummary would be if you get good actors, and a large enough market your dreams can come true.","/r/totallynotrobots","Ive been secretly stealing my grandmothers compression socks that she uses to ease diabetic pain.if youve ever worn a pair youll realize its worth being sent to hell","If you enjoy them so much, why not simply buy yourself a pair?","Totally by accident.

","Back in highschool, my very first girlfriend was really turned on by the fact that I was bisexual, shy, and inexperienced, and was kind of aggressively sexual -- my first ever kiss was after being shoved up against a wall, which got me incredibly horny, and my first sexual experience was being shoved to the ground and ridden. Being inexperienced, I didn't really think much of it in terms of specific turn-ons.\n\nFast-forward a few years, after more experience in general, and a guy I was dating and I were play-wrestling and giggling like idiots, and then he pins me and thought it would be amusing to jokingly dry-hump me, (he was a 100% bottom).

A child born between A and B would have a better chance at being born with a strong immune system to fight those diseases.\n\nAnecdotal experience for me, but my ex loved how I smelled after a hard day of work outside. I'd come home sweaty as hell and she would pretty much stick her nose in my pit. We had a daughter and she has had a great immune system. Hardly ever sick at all even when around other sick kids at daycare. ","The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes have a hand in immunity and the body's response to pathogens. There is a huge amount of different gene expressions one can have in the MHC, so no two people have the exact same MHC. The sexual selection theory goes that we generally try to reproduce with people who have vastly different MHC expressions from our own, to hopefully provide our offspring with the widest genetic protection against pathogens possible. Studies have shown that people tend to be attracted to the smell of those who have a very different MHC from their own, hence why OP's kink could be related to the MHC.

The first time was the best orgasm I've had. The second time I filled it up with some lotion but it wasn't as good. The only downside is that there are some small seeds in the cantaloupe. I stopped after though because it would cost too much money to carry on. I've def. gotten a few weird boners in the produce section of grocery stores. A cheaper option is just hollowing out a cucumber. It's really smooth. Hollowed out it can still be kinda small though and break so sometimes just kinda cutting a slit in the bottom side of the cucumber lets it fit a bit better. \n\nOne time I tried making some dough to use for it, but it didn't work that well.

It's a similar thing with race play or age play.","I understand why people get wound up about those things.

Which I didn't know was a morph site at the time. \n\nFound an image sequence where a woman was blowing her boobs bigger with a hose. My teen mind thought it was the hottest thing I had ever seen. Proceed to scour the internet searching stuff like balloon boobs, inflatable boobs, blow up boobs, etc... before eventually finding the commonly used term Breast expansion. \n\nIt's largely a fun fantasy thing for me. Because as much as I love huge boobs I'm well aware that they can cause women problems. Which totally sucks by the way. \n\nIf you're having trouble picturing what I mean when I say Breast Expansion I'll toss up a few gifs here. [This one](https://i.makeagif.com/media/9-01-2015/sp1D1S.gif) is from that god awful super hero movie where Carmen Electra playing a Mystique type character uses her morphing powers to make her boobs bigger. \n\n[This one](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/20150701/5225497/kelly-breast-expansion-o.gif) is from a 3D animation specifically made about breast expansion. [This one](http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m167/BEProfessor/Fg2.gif) is from the porn Flesh Gordon. [This one](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/69/512234-chifusa_manyuu__breast_expansion__animated_gif_.gif) is from an anime I don't remember the name. But its about warrior women who when they fight if they win their boobs get bigger and the losers get smaller. Strength is shown by how big their boobs are. Oh Japan shine on you crazy diamond. And lastly [this one](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/960/496/308.gif) is just something someone did with photoshop. Ain't technology amazing.  \n\nAnyway there's a ton of variation to the kink. Including not only breasts getting bigger. Some of it can be pretty tame some of it gets pretty far out there. For me it's just fun to think about and roleplay. But like everything there are some out there who take this shit way to seriously. If anyone reads this and wants to ask questions feel free to. I actually like pushing this kink because I think it's a ton of fun.\n\nEdit: Fixed a typo.\n","They do?","Wait, what?","Watch a girl with B cups grow to F cups in a matter of minutes, and have her be incredibly turned on by it.

","Umm haha, well, my girlfriend already has really big boobs so occasionally, when our pocketbook is looking right, she will go and buy a couple bras, one that fits, and then one a size or 3 too small.

It wasn't really anything more than just a mention while we were watching so I just thought it was just her talking to get me hot.\n\n7 years later we both get laid off at nearly the same time.  We end up homeless and have to live in a hotel selling plasma and doing yard work for cash and my wife mentions doing porn again.  I had a decent DSLR and video camera so we looked up how to start in amatuer porn.\n\nShe gets a Southern Charms and I take her pics; it does really well.  We do a dozen POV videos and sell them on Clips4Sale, and those do well too. Then a guy emails and wants a custom video where my wife is with a BBC.  My wife had been with other women since we got together; we even considered ourselves 'open' and had a live in girlfriend for a while.  She had never shown interest in being with another man though.

I was pretty nervous, never done anything like this I walked in and found her in the master bathroom in a tub filled with bubbles. She started by sucking my cock, which was awesome and then we moved to the bedroom where she asked me to cum on her face. After that she went and wiped her face off then told me to get on my hands and knees on the bed. She yelled another woman's name and a younger lady walked in, scantily clad.

Recently that hasn't happened as much since we've been going at it, but our trysts have always been fun and spontaneous and not necessarily passionate and loving affairs, which is cool but a bit dull. The other day I started thinking about him and suddenly thought of him just fucking a girl from behind while facing me, while the girl is busy touching me, and it got me way too excited.

In this story, the person was just a bystander who also happened to be a police officer. While it's unlikely a charge of threatening a police officer would stick, as they had no idea that the person was a police officer, they could still be brought up on whatever standard charges go along with harassment and threatening the life of an individual.\n\nI can't see much ground for a civil suit here., unless the two charges I mentioned aren't arrestable offences. She didn't say she was arresting him for threatening a police officer, just that he was threatening a police officer as a way of announcing herself as a police officer, which was a true statement.","Civil suits are meaningless in that sense, the burden of proof is minimal and legality isn't the primary determination.

It's just two different alloys.  It makes the knife pretty.\n\nNowadays though there are some nice supersteels out there that you don't see in damascus that will outperform it though, so unless you really like the look of damascus, i'd choose a knife with m390, or S90V over it. \n\n\n[bonus full damascus folder pic](http://i.imgur.com/YVMapte.jpg)\n\nthis one's a bit different, it has damascus laminated over a VG-10 steel core, so you get the pretty damascus but the actual edge is one solid steel type.  \n\n Also the effect is much more subtle, not much acid etching going on...

If you leave a blade mostly hard, it will take a finer edge and take much longer to get dull, but it also leaves it brittle.

Kitchen knives are usually incredibly hard for their size (especially high end Japanese style) because it gives much better performance for it's intended use, while cleavers and camp knives are expected to endure shock loads and are tempered softer.

To the layman, probably not a noticeable difference, but a difference none the less. This also varies depending on which steels are forge welded to create the Damascus.","deadly poison increases your attack by 2, so its stronger","The acid wont do anything unless its undiluted and the blade sits there for weeks.  The only thing its doing is causing an oxidation barrier on the higher carbon steels mqking them darker but not on the higher nickle content steels.  How ever damascus or pattern welded steel has a single flaw which is very serious. It's called delamination.  This occurs when the steel isnt welded properly and the layers start to come undone. ","The acid shouldn't weaken the blade any.  Consider it a surface deep chemical attack on the steel.  You can usually remove an acid etch with a quick buff of the surface.  In industry, this is commonly called acid etching.  We use it all the time to pull out visual representations of weld joint macro and micro structures for examination.  It's incredibly useful for repairs as well.  ","If the steel is forged and folded like the layers are revealed, it should have a better structure, but it depends how the forging was cooled and how many layers, that were folded.\n\nBut I think this more of an aesthetic thing, when buying knives.\n\n","Nowadays Damascus steel isn't really that special, but in medieval times it was arguably the best steel in the world (arguably as it's likely the Japanese Katana was superior but there's no recorded instance of them meeting).  To give you an idea, when someone wielding a Damascus blade came up against your average English Knight, it wasn't all that uncommon for the knights blade to straight up be cut in half by the Damascus one.  ","&gt; To give you an idea, when someone wielding a Damascus blade came up against your average English Knight, it wasn't all that uncommon for the knights blade to straight up be cut in half by the Damascus one.\n\nI'm gonna call bullshit on that, unless you can give me a source. Also, Japanese steel was not better. As /u/HuffsGOldStars said, it was folded so many times because the materials were not as good as western steel. This is why western blacksmiths don't have the same tradition of folding steel, because they did not need it.","You are correct on all counts.\n\nAlso,  I'm going to point out something  (and, really this bothers the shit out of me). What we call \"Damascus\" steel today ***ISN'T*** really true Damascus steel. It's forged like it, but the actual formula for the base steel is still unknown.  It seems to me, that there's an additive that we're missing.  \n\nNo shit, I honestly think it's something stupid simple that we just overlook because it's so simple and obvious.  Zirconium Oxide comes to mind. Why? Sand. There is a lot of fucking sand in the Middle East.  I believe that it is possible that a bit of sand worked its way into some of the ore as they smelted it and wound up folding the steel as a means to make up for it and even things out a bit, only to stumble upon something better than what they had before.  That would explain the nano-tube structure they find on surviving pieces.\n\nWith regards to the accounts from the Crusades pertaining to Damascus Steel being able to cut through lesser metals... Obviously bunk. Exaggerated to make themselves the underdogs. But, it is possible that it was strong enough to bite into and sharply dent other swords (like, swinging a cheaply made stainless steel sword onto a piece of rebar)","Umm, I think you're conflating a few things. First, you're correct that what we call damascus steel in modern parlance is more technically called pattern welded steel. However they are NOT forged the same in the slightest. Damascus steel traditionally referred to a crucible cast steel from India with an extremely high carbon content that was cast, allowed to slowly cool, then forged at a very low heat so as not to dissolve the carbide structures that formed in the steel upon initially cooling. Pattern welded steel on the other hand is simply two or more pieces of steel that are welded together and formed to shape, the Japanese did this to even out carbon content in their extremely poor iron ore and the Vikings did it to show off their craftsmanship. Now on to the properties of damascus, damascus (also known as wootz) was the absolute cutting edge of steel technology *for the time* and really only for small knives. When compared to any modern steel it is completely outstripped in every way, true damascus is extremely soft, doesn't take a very acute edge, and is fairly useless for anything but a small knife. Also, people tend to mystify true damascus as some sort of ancient lost hocus-pocus when in fact it was rediscovered how to make it way back in the 80's! If you have a furnace at home (easy to make) you can even make it yourself. And as for the \"carbon nano-tubes\" part? Yeah, any time you get graphite you're going to have carbon nano-tubes, bucky balls, and other similar structures form randomly, but this also happens in cast iron and for some reason no one ever suggests that would make a good weapon... Carbon nano-tubes are even found in soot from your fireplace, it's seriously EVERYWHERE, but it makes a good headliner and gets spread about much like the myths about katanas. Anyways, this turned into a book but I hope it helped clear some things up for you! ","I'd read that the whole reason that Japanese swordsmiths folded the steel so much was because the quality of Japanese iron ore was shit. They didn't have to fold it so much elsewhere because the iron in those places was much better.","now sell it on steam","It's a stattracker!","Surprisingly, some of the CSGO knives are worth more than their real life counterparts.","Most have been for ages.","how is that surprising? knives aren't rare in real life","same with cs:go, everyone has 2 knives","I see what you did there.

The recipe for true, traditional, real Damascus steel has been lost to time, for lack of a better description.","It still is. This is called Damascus steel because of the pattern","We know a lot about what the steel is made of. But to date, nobody has been able to replicate the forging methods to recreate the pattern you see in Damascus steel artifacts. They may have used folding, but true Damascus blades are not pattern welded. The patterns are actually a result of the way the trace elements interacted with carbon throughout the forging process. \n\nSomething similar can be achieved through pattern welding (though it isn't quite as impressive looking, imo), but anything you see today that is advertised as \"Damascus\" is really Damascus-patterned. Not true Damascus steel.\n\nThat doesn't mean modern pattern welded blades don't take an impressive amount of time and skill to produce. They do. And the one in this post is absolutely amazing looking. But labeling it \"Damascus\" is a bit misleading.","Not really, people make it out to be far more mysterious than it really is!

","Did not know that, but now I do !!!","and for making circuit boards","What's the enchantment on that?","Time for some clarifications on misconceptions, because this is not *real* Damascus steel.\n\nThe steel you see above if pattern welded steel, it comes from a process where multiple layers of steel are welded together, then forged to produce a pattern affect that resembles Damasacus steel. \n\nThe process of making *real* Damascus steel (also known as wootz steel) has been lost to us. We can scan old Damascus steel blades to determine their chemical composition (learning what had been used to originally), but we can't figure out how it was smelted in production. \n\nWhen steel cools its molecules align in specific ways that allow it to have different properties; very fast cooling will leave the steel very hard but also very brittle, very slow cooling leaves the steel less hard but also less brittle. In sword fights you didn't want your sword to shatter in battle so this second type was preferred.\n\nDamascus steel seemed to defy those rules though, it was both very hard and flexible; which is why it was very popular and well known. And whatever process that was used to create it left an odd wavy pattern on it. We still have no idea how Damascus steel was made, but we keep finding new properties about it like carbon nanotubes inside the steel's cdystal steuctures.\n\nModern pattern welded steel resembles Damasacus steel, so people have taken to calling it that; but because pattern welded steel isn't a singular piece of steel this modern replica isn't as strong as a singular piece od similar steel would be. So it's very much the opposite of the steel it's ancestral name derivates from, but because people still associate the name Damascus with quality these blades can be sold with a large price increase.\n\nIf you're interested in how steel gets different qualities based on the environment it was formed in, or had any other questions feel free to pm me. I'm a chemical engineer who has been researching this subject with my free time, in the hope to one day bring the real Damascus steel back to this world.","You should probably learn some metallurgy first before you go about reinventing the wheel. You're talking out your ass if you're claiming pearlite makes a superior blade to properly tempered martensite. Also, do a little more research on wootz maybe? It should only take a couple seconds to find out it has already been successfully remade.  \n  \nhttp://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/9809/Verhoeven-9809.html","Maybe you should read the article you link (because I have read it). They believe that they can recreate Damascus sttel ignots, but the ignots they create all suffer from the same flaw, they can't be forged into blades by blacksmiths.\n\nSome would believe that this indicates that we've lost the forging process, but I find it much more likely that the process of creating the ignots, discussed in this article is not the original way Damascus was made.","That's not what that said at all, and if you look the article disproves you since they actually did forge a blade as part of the experiment. The damascus steel is hot short, which means forging it at usual forging temperatures causes it to crumble. This matches the accounts of smiths in France/England who bought raw ingots and attempted to make their own knives out of it. Hot shortness is simply a function of the high carbon content and is similar to cast iron in that regards. The paper outlined two different methods of forging the ingots.  \n\n1. Get the ingot well above usual forging temperatures, let a thick decarburized skin form on it, and forge to shape. Then normalize the blank multiple times to reintroduce the carbide banding.  \n\n2. Forge the ingot at a dull red heat, this is probably the way it was actually done. Damascus steel iron ore naturally contained high levels of phosphorus which contributes to ductility at low heat.  \n  \nIf you actually are a chemical engineer your lack of reading comprehension is scary to say the least.

Pattern welding involves folding layers in different ways of which the end result will be a very predictable and often geometric effect (hence 'patterns'). From the pattern which forms here looks more like how the crystal structure would naturally form if it had been cast. It also definitely isn't damascus steel, as this is clearly adit etching, and also the making of damascus steel is considered a lost art.\n\nFrom the wiki link: \n\n&gt;The original method of producing Damascus steel is not known. Modern attempts to duplicate the metal have not been entirely successful due to differences in raw materials and manufacturing techniques.\n\nBoth together would just be overkill, they both have a similar effect. Why not just call it what it is? Acid etched steel sounds cool too.\n\nEdit: Yeah you're right guys, the spread of misinformation doesn't matter because this gif just looks so damn *cool*! Keep those downvotes coming","Also from the wiki page\n&gt;Pattern-welded steel has been referred to as \"Damascus steel\" since 1973...\n\n[snip]\n\n&gt;...and currently the term \"damascus\" (although technically incorrect) is widely accepted to describe modern pattern welded steel blades in the trade.\n\nThis isn't an acid etched pattern but rather two kinds of steel that react differently to acid pattern welded together used to forge a blade.","The misinformation of your first part you mean? Show me ONE source that says pattern welded steel is required to have geometric pattern, just one. I'll be waiting. ","And thus /r/mallninjashit is born","You've upset the mall ninjas, you better not fuck with them","I'll have to look in some more on that, but it sounds plausible. I just think that something that was a major deal in the old world being rediscovered would be a little more well known, and not be listed as a Lost Art.","Why would it be? There were a couple of articles written in the 80's when it was rediscovered, but bottom line it's a mediocre steel at best. Keep in mind most of the mythical claims about it were just that, mythical. Most of the stories you hear about it originated with the Persian traders who were trying to drive up the price enough to justify carting them across a continent. The modern equivalent, Talonite, absolutely blows it out of the water in every way. ","For multiple reasons. Namely, it's a lost art. A utility that had been the most significant thing in the area. It was more than just weapons. It was farming tools, butcher's knives, and in some cases, even cookware. \n\nKnowing the actual formula is more than just having the ability to recreate it. It's a glimpse into the ancient world. How they got the materials needed to formulate it, how it worked in their economy.  You keep going on about the \"mythical\" properties, but if the real thing was as shit as you say, it wouldn't have been so widely used and for such a long time.","I never said it was shit, *for the time*! You have to remember, most people in Europe didn't have access to good steel, and vanadium (the alloy the ore in India naturally contained) is an extremely good grain refiner, deep hardener, and carbide former. But compared to any modern tool steel of the last 100 years? Yeah it's shit. You are underestimating just how much the Bessemer Process and it's ability to precisely control alloy content in the 1850's changed steel technology. Before Bessemer your choice was either cast iron, or wrought iron unless you wanted to pay out the nose or buy from the Swiss (their iron ore had EXTREMELY low sulfur and phosphorus content) but afterwards you could turn out literally tons of steel at a time with exacting alloy contents and no contaminants. Also, could you link these bowls and utensils? I've only really heard it used for knives, swords, and a couple pieces of armor for very rich people. ","Also, Damascus steel wasn't produced in the middle east, it was produced in India. Europeans called it Damascus steel because it came up the Damascus trading road. ","Nova did an episode on Damascus blades a while back which is where i heard this statistic.  I'll see if I can track it down.  Basically the long and short of it is Damascus blades where made, surprise surprise, in Damascus.  There was a period of a few hundred years where Damascus was putting out Damascus steel blades and then suddenly the secret was lost and no one knew why.  It was eventually discovered (eventually meaning relatively recent, 10-15 years iirc) that the secret was iron containing trace amounts of... some element i can't remember off the top of my head.  Anyway, there was a mine near Damascus where all the iron contained some of the stuff, and that's how Damascus Steel was first forged in the first place.  The reason the secret was lost was the mine went dry.  Anyway, this extra element made the swords super strong.  Nowadays we have a better understanding of the actual chemical composition of steel and exactly what elements it takes to make it stronger, but back then they were just tossing charcol and iron into a furnace and hoping.  They could hold a finer edge than British blades, and Damascus Steel blades were famed for \"being able to cut a silk scarf in half as it fell to the ground\" which was not something western blades could do.  All that said, what we know as Damascus Steel today, still isn't exactly the same so it's likely there's some additive we're missing.  Comparison with genuine Damascus Blades to todays modern versions see a noticeable drop in quality compared to the old ones.\n\nYou're misunderstanding.  Yes the quality of the initial steel was terrible.  But the resulting blade could hold an edge far finer than anything westerners could come up with.  Good British blades could cut a man in half with a single swing.  Katana's however were actually measured buy how much they could cut, and merely cutting through one body would be a terrible sword.  The japanese sword testers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tameshigiri) would cut through straw, cadavers (fake bodies basically), or even convicted criminals in order to test out the swords.  A sword worth buying would need to be able to cut through at least 3 people, and the really good ones were upwards of 5.","&gt; Nowadays Damascus steel isn't really that special, but in medieval times it was arguably the best steel in the world\n\nYou comparing entirely two different things. Damascus Steel today is a completely different product then what you are historically referring to. Damascus steel hasn't been produced in hundreds of years. The present day \"Damascus Steel\" blades are just stealing the popular name and that is all they have in common. [Source](http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/9809/verhoeven-9809.html) and more info on the blades themselves.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the technique of producing wootz Damascus steel blades is a lost art. The date of the last blades produced with the highest-quality damascene patterns is uncertain, but is probably around 1750; it is unlikely that blades displaying low-quality damascene patterns were produced later than the early 19th century. Debate has persisted in the metallurgy community over the past 200 years as to how these blades were made and why the surface pattern appeared.6-8 Research efforts over the years have claimed the discovery of methods to reproduce wootz Damascus steel blades,9-12 but all of these methods suffer from the same problem—modern bladesmiths have been unable to use the methods to reproduce the blades. \"","I go more into that in my reply to the other guy.","Probably because of copyright issues ","wat","#PROBABLY BECAUSE OF COPYRIGHT ISSUES \n***\n\n##[^^^I ^^^am ^^^a ^^^bot, ^^^and ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^respond ^^^to ^^^myself.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CantHearYouBot/)","different time zones.

He doesn't sport colors or sag his pants so his underwear shows... he wears high fashion, and tries to look good. He's confident in his ability as a musician and artist and he's open to the world about his innermost thoughts. You can't ever say Kanye isn't 'real'. ...and yet, the world hates him. Rothesburger raped a woman in the bathroom and people everywhere root for him to win the Superbowl. Kanye says \"be yourself, follow your dreams\", and people want him and his family burned alive.

I like to add the sugar directly to the warm water/yeast mixture to give the yeast something to feed off of when proofing. I also knead the dough by hand so if you have any questions about making this without using a stand mixer then let me know! I knead it by hand on a floured surface for about 10 minutes, reserving 1/2 cup flour of the 3 &amp; 1/2 cups total and adding it in slowly as I knead, as to not to add too much flour. You want your dough fairly tacky.\n\nhttp://www.laurainthekitchen.com/recipes/homemade-pizza/\n\nI also like to prebake my pizza dough, brushing it lightly with olive oil and pricking it with a fork several times (this prevents excessive air bubbles) before baking. I prebake on my pizza stone for 4-5 minutes at 475 degrees F,  just until puffed up and barely starting to become golden in some areas, then add sauce and toppings, and bake for an additional 6-8 minutes or until crust is golden and cheese is melted. ","Wow, awesome advice. I always preheat my stone but never prebake my crust.  I've just started mastering the dough recipe, using yeast takes some experience, IMO, to get right.  I use the following recipe and think it would be just perfect with a little prebake to get the dough/crust nice and crispy:\n\nhttp://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/pizza-dough-recipe.html","Glad I could help! That crust recipe is very similar to the one I use, just slightly more flour and water. I think it'll work out perfectly with a little prebake! ","How did the slices fair once you cut them and lifted them off of the plate/peel/stone? It looks amazing but is there a trick to keeping everything from sliding off each slice?","Yeah you gotta put the cheese on top of the toppings! And then add extra cheese on top of that.","It sliced and lifted perfectly! No sliding whatsoever. I find that piling on too much cheese can cause this, so I don't add excessive cheese. The amount was perfect for us and it cut beautifully. ","How do you form your dough?\n\nI have only made pizza about 10 times but the shape of my dough usually ends up at best oblong. I also use Trader Joe's pre-made dough, so that could be a factor as well.\n\n[This is the video/method I have used (hand formed, no rolling pin)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIJlRXMfW50)","I'm definitely no pro, and a lot of times my pizza is slightly oddly shaped but that doesn't bother me! That's the charm of homemade food. :) It's hard to explain, but I usually just pat down the dough with my hands, and then with one hand I hold it and let it \"droop\" so that it stretches, and then as it droops I rotate it in a circle to continue stretching until it forms a circle. I definitely can't toss it haha! I'm sorry that I can't explain it better. ","I understand exactly what you are saying, that is my saving move when the toss goes awry. ","That's exactly how I do it too but I've never explained it very well either.","That is absolutely gorgeous. ","Do you just use it fresh? Pizza dough always kind of sucks unless you make it the day before and let it sit in the fridge for a day.","You're right. I usually forget or don't have time the day before...\n\nSo I use [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/20171/quick-and-easy-pizza-crust/). I put it in the mixer for about 5-10 minutes and that really gets the texture of the dough right and I sub out the sugar for honey. The texture is great, the dough itself is kind of bland (which is why I use honey to add a little something to it), but pizza toppings and brushing a little garlic butter on the crust helps a lot.\n\nI use Alton Browns dough recipe if I'm making it the day before and there's definitely a better quality there.","There is a list of dough recipes in the pizza subreddit sidebar if you go take a look :)","I usually don't have the forethought to make my pizza dough a day in advance, so usually I use it fresh without any issue. On the couple of occasions I have let it sit in the fridge for a day, it turned out really well! Sometimes after the dough rises I'll wrap half of it up in greased plastic wrap in a Tupperware container then pop it in the freezer. Then whenever I'm craving pizza, to defrost I place it in the fridge overnight or on my counter for a few hours. That always turns out really delicious, too!","Ditch the all purpose flour and try it with bread flour. More gluten is more better. King Arthur bread flour is the king of all gluten. Laura knows how to stretch out a pizza dough and bake cookies, and she has some well big and shapely cans, but she's no chef.","&gt; More gluten is more better\n\nThis. Here in italy we call those varieties \"Manitoba Flour\" or \"Farina Americana\". I personally don't like sugared dough and use only 1/2  of a tsp (sic!) of yeast per kg of flour - you've got to let it rise for several hours though. This way it's much lighter on your stomach as there's no \"non transformed\" yeast left when you eat it.\n\nIf you get one of those small hi-temp pizza ovens (with a max. temperature around 400C) you can get rid of the oil too (I've got a G3 Ferrari Pizza Express from Amazon for less than €100).\n\nOPs pizza looks yummy though.\n","Do you have any advice for dough that ends up too \"bread\"? I just started making my own dough and it sometimes tastes as if I'm just eating on top of a thick loaf of bread, not the texture of dough. \n\nEdit: \"breast\" --&gt; \"bread\"","Perhaps try using bread flour if you're currently using all purpose? It'll give you a less \"bready\" crust, and it'll be chewier/more crisp. Also make sure that you're stretching the dough thin enough, as it'll rise in the oven. ","High gluten flour, let rise. Let rise again. Let set over night in the fridge. \nBring to room temp. Pizz zah. ","What about the rest of the pizza? You wouldn't leave a gal hanging would you?","Honestly the rest is pretty straight forward so I didn't post or follow a recipe, but I'll walk you through the general steps. \n\n1. Make your favorite pizza dough-- you may follow the recipe I posted or you can make another, it's up to you. \n\n2. While the dough is rising, make your other toppings. First I poached a chicken breast, shredded it, and tossed it in barbecue sauce (use your favorite homemade or store bought). Alternatively you could use rotisserie chicken, shredded homemade roast chicken, etc.\n\n3. Cook 3-4 pieces of bacon on the stovetop until crispy. \n4. Slice half a medium sweet onion and cook it in the rendered bacon fat over low heat until sweet and caramelized. This may take a while. Normally I probably would've let them get even more deep &amp; caramel colored but I had guests arriving sooner than expected so I pulled them slightly early. Still sweet and delicious though. \n\n5. Form your pizza dough, prebake it as directed, and top with your fav bbq sauce, then most of the bbq chicken (the cheese on top will protect it), some mozzarella and cheddar (or other cheeses of your choice),  the onions, bacon, and remaining chicken. Bake for 6-8 more minutes until crust is browned and cheese is melted. Garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro. \n\nHope this helps!","Thank you so much!","Try adding some ricotta cheese on the next barbecue chicken pizza.","Put it in my belly!","How do you transfer pizza over to the stone?!  \n\nEVERY single time I try to transfer it, it doesn't move.  I use a metal pizza paddle, I try to flour the paddle, brush olive oil on it, nothing works.  It ends up being a piece of slop when I start getting frustrated.\n\nI assume preheating the dough helps?  Because I usually make the whole pizza on top of the paddle and then it doesn't move.","I've yet to purchase a pizza peel but ideally you use that, and make sure that you flour the surface and work quickly so the dough doesn't stick to the peel. Blow under the crust to prevent it from sticking, too. Just shimmy it onto the pizza stone! \n\nHowever, since I don't have a pizza peel, I did it the incorrect way but it works for me! So I just took the preheated pizza stone out of the oven and quickly and carefully laid my stretched out dough onto the stone. Prick it with a fork and brush with olive oil, working fast, and pop it immediately back into the oven. After the prebake, it'll come right off of your stone and you can put it on your paddle to load up the toppings. Again I understand this method isn't correct but it has worked like a charm for me. ","I make mine on parchment paper. And leave it. Cut paper to stone size and set atop a pizza pan.  Slides easy from pan to stone and back and forth. Just watch it the dough will sweat if left. ","Try using cornmeal! My wife and I had this problem too. Now we put cornmeal on the pizza paddle/peel and then put the dough on top. This allows you to put the dough in the oven and the cornmeal will stick to the dough, effectively keeping it from sticking to the stone. We usually prebake our dough, but it has worked for when we don't prebake it either!","Lift an edge and blow under the dough.  If you are pre baking, you can fold the dough blow place it on the back half of the stone then unfold. Corn meal can also help. ","I hate you! ","I hope that the guy who cuts this knows what he's doing.","Is there a way to cut that without it ending up in a gloopy mess?","Cook it all he way &amp; give it a little time to setup after it's been taken out of the oven, but who has time when your pizza looks as good as that?","I do try to do that once I take it out, but I usually end up burning the roof of my mouth because all of those crispy toppings are just too tempting to set aside and wait for them to cool. \"450 degrees? pssh, my mouth can handle ... oh my .....!!!!\"","Like this \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nIG7rde.jpg","Ayyyyyy","That looks like a mess.

","Oki I got a whole chicken was thinking if I should cook it first then peal the meat off and put on the pizza, i just didnt wanna have it go dry on me.","You're only cooking it in the oven for 6-8 minutes so it won't dry out on you!

We asked her why she wasn't just downloading music like we thought everyone had done for the last 10-15 years... turned out she had tried to do it using Russian sites.

Netflix is not collecting money from a guy who might or might not otherwise be a customer. \n\nAlthough Netflix also has this guy for whom Netflix is an increasingly expected part of his life -- his dependence on Netflix is growing.

For the brother, it sounds like he doesn't suffer consequences for his actions. Now, to be fair, I am speculating heavily on the family dynamic from a third party source, but if the dynamic is as I described then I think it's better to make sure you're clear with why you're doing things ","Oh this was not the first time his brother stole stuff. He has definitely gotten punished for it several times. It got so bad that his dad put a lock on my boyfriend's door, but not the brother's door. He also had to make sure his window was locked. The only reason he got to the PS3 this time was because it was in the living room for once. His brother does get punished by his dad, he'll be grounded and he's not allowed a smartphone at all, but it doesn't matter when he goes to their mom's house and she doesn't continue the punishment because she thinks he's a perfect angel. I honestly don't think his dad even knew about the stolen PS3 and game, because by the time he asked for the Netflix password, we already had it all back. (His mom definitely knew though because we asked her if it was there). I think he only asked for the password because he knew my boyfriend was more reasonable than his brother, and might give it over if asked nicely, and he also wanted his brother to shut up about it.

Good shit.\n\n&gt;“What civilization is, is six billion people trying to make themselves happy by standing on each other’s shoulders and kicking each others’ teeth in. It’s not a pleasant situation. And yet, you can stand back and look at this planet and see…that we have the money, the power, the medical understanding, the scientific know how, the love and the community to produce a kind of human paradise. But we are lead by the least among us. The least intelligent, noble, visionary, the least among us. And we do not fight back against the dehumanizing values that are handed down as control icons. This is something…I don’t want to go off on one…it’s a lecture in itself… but culture is NOT your friend. Culture is for other people’s convenience and the convenience of various institutions, churches, companies, tax collection schemes, what have you…it is not your friend. It INSULTS you, it disempowers you…it uses and abuses you. NONE of us are well treated by culture. Yet we glorify the collective potential of the individual, the rights of the individual…but the culture is a perversion. It fetishises objects, it creates consumer mania, it preaches endless forms of false happiness and false understanding in the form of swirly religions and silly cults…it invites people to diminish themselves and dehumanise themselves, by behaving like…machines. Mean processors of means passed down by Hollywood and Madison Avenue…. How do we fight back? I think that by creating art…ART. Man was not put on this planet to toil in the mud. Or the God who put us on the planet to toil in the mud is no God I want to have any part of, it’s some kind of Gnostic demon, some kind of cannabalistic demiurge that should be thoroughly renounced and rejected….by creating art, we maximise our humanity and become much more necessary and incomprehensible to the machines! The whole thing with culture and language is that they tend to become traps. And yet, they can become the platforms for enormous freedom…if you understand what it’s all about - and what it’s all about is YOU! You are the center of the mandala. You are not marginalized in any way. The message that the culture gives us is that we are marginal. It doesn’t matter if you have 100 million dollars Fortune magazine will tell you that so do 10,000 other people on the North American continent! This is part of the democratic legacy, we are constantly told that ‘you’re not special’, ‘special isn’t special’, ‘anyone could do it’. And so then, when you look for guidance, direction, mentorship, we always look towards institutions. ‘Well, I’ll go to the university, the army, someone will give me a larger purpose’ - but it is YOU who is the final arbiter. If you keep yourself as the final arbiter then you will be less susceptible to infection by cultural illusion. Now, it makes you feel bad not to be infected by cultural illusion - because it’s called alienation. The reason that we feel alienated because the culture is infantile, trivial, and stupid. The cost of sanity in this society is a certain level of alienation. I grapple with this as a parent, and you come to this realization. What’ll it be, alienated cynical intellectual, or slackjawed halfwit consumer of the horseshit being handed down from on high?! There’s not much choice there. We all want our children to be well adjusted, it’s just that there’s nothing to be well adjusted TO! In the past 100 years as these super technologies have been developed in the West, data has been arriving about the practices of Aboriginal cultures all over the planet - that they dissolve original culture values through an interaction and symbiosis to local plants, that peturb brain chemistry. In this domain the cultural operating system is wiped clean. Something older, even for these people, more vital, more in touch with the animal soul, replaces the cultural operating system. Something not in touch with geography and history, but something writ in the language of the flesh itself. This is who you really are, this is true nakedness. You are not naked when you take off your clothes, you still wear your religious assumptions, your fears, your prejudices, your illusions, your delusions. When you shed the cultural operating system, you essentially stand naked before the inspection of your own psyche. It’s from that position, outside the cultural operating system, that we can ask real questions about what does it mean to be human, what kind of circumstance are we caught in, and what kind of structures can we put in place to assuage the pain, and accentuate the glory and wonder that lurks waiting for us, in this very narrow slice of time between the birth canal and the yawning grave? We have to return to first premises. I travel around a lot and get that jolting experience frequently, of let’s say, leaving London on a foggy evening and arriving in Johannesburg 14 hours later to a sweltering day in a city of 14 million on the brink of anarchy. I get to change my cultural operating system frequently, and so I notice the relativity of these systems. Some work for some things and some for others. You don’t have to be the victim of your culture - it’s fragile. It can be remade if you wish it to be. It can be wiped out and replaced with something else.”\n&gt;- Terence McKenna","[deleted]","no but i suggest listening to a Mono/Poly album\n\nhes like my favorite producer currently","But WTC 7 totally couldn't be a demolition, right?

Speeding while causing an accident would be a crime worse than just causing an accident by simple mistake because it was more reckless.

I can understand talking on the phone hands free or maybe adjusting a phone that's on a mount that keeps your eyes up but not texting. ","Look, (in response to a few other replies) I don't think anyone here is debating the legality of what the cop is doing (i.e. if it's illegal, it's illegal), but the basis on which the law itself was made. Banning all cell phone use in a vehicle, no matter the state of the vehicle is a knee-jerk reaction. Suppose the drivers in that video were just tapping on their car's touchscreen or GPS instead? Same level of distraction, but not the phone--should interacting with the car's screen be outlawed too? Even at a stop?\n\nLet's not pretend that looking at your phone at a stop light or in a stopped traffic jam *is the same thing* or *presents the same danger* as checking your phone at highways speeds for 10 seconds at a time. The law in question is a blanket measure.\n\nThe example you give is so specific and requires so many more variables (and driver fuck-ups) that it's pretty obviously a bad basis for comparison. The fact of the matter is, if they believe they should start moving forward, they should put the phone down, look around, then proceed when it's deemed safe. Just because some asshats continue to stare down when they start moving, doesn't mean looking at a phone while stopped is *intrinsically* dangerous. It's a faulty comparison.\n\nDrivers who creep without checking are guilty of a shitty driving habit and would creep alike anyway if distracted by checking a car's GPS, picking up a dropped food item, reaching back to check on a kid, etc. If creep is the concern, it's not the phone that's the issue, it's the driver's behavior and their lack of checking in front of them before proceeding.","It's not comparable to messing with the radio that is mounted to the car. Those have large knobs and buttons designed to make them easy to use without looking at them, and they're bolted down so the buttons are always in exactly the same place. Changing a radio station is also much simpler than sending even the briefest text.\n\nAs for GPS units, yeah, I'm pretty sure messing with those while driving is illegal, and should be. Those things are just as complicated as phones. That's why every one I've seen warns you not to do that when it starts up.\n\nI agree that creeping without looking would probably still happen if phones didn't exist, but it would happen a lot less. Your radio and GPS are designed to minimize their distraction from the drive, and usually don't need to be messed with more than once at the start of the journey. Phones are designed to grab your attention with buzzing and flashing lights, and this happens often and at random intervals.\n\nAnd it's not just about the creeping. Everyone here seems to agree that inattentive drivers at the very least inconvenience the people behind them by needing to reacquaint themselves with their surroundings before moving again. Thus is frustrating for you and I but for emergency vehicles, if they have to give every other driver an extra few seconds to put the phone down before moving out of the way, they will not get where they need to be in time.\n\nThere are so many cons to texting behind the wheel in any situation. Potentially big, life changing consequences. And the alternative, putting your flashers on and pulling over for 60 seconds, is so insignificant, that touching your phone at all while in traffic is immensely selfish, childish, asinine. It's indefensible.","&gt;No, you can't. \n\nYes, you can.\n\n&gt;Even if you're stopped, you have to be aware of pedestrians crossing on front of you, \n\nWhat are pedestrians doing on the freeway, crossing away from intersections, etc?\n\n&gt;cars behind you, \n\nIf you're stopped in traffic there is literally nothing you can do about the cars behind you.\n\n&gt;etc.\n\nOkay then, how about let's rip all of the accessories out of all the cars.

You need to be aware of pedestrians in the intersection EVEN if you're stopped.\n\nNot everyone gets their own intersection, in the video, the officer apparently cited drivers who were far from the intersection, that cannot possibly be for the safety of pedestrians who may or may not be in the crosswalk.\n\n&gt;But making texting and driving illegal deters the crime from happening. So it's still a benefit. \n\nMaking texting and driving illegal creates a new citation which was already covered by existing law. It undoubtedly catches many innocent drivers who were not texting, and were not endangering anyone, therefore harming people unjustly while not having the desired effect on public safety.\n\nPlease consider this perspective from a TC article:\n\n&gt;&gt;*As we've noted there are lots and lots of things that can distract a driver which are still considered perfectly legal, such as changing the radio station, talking to passengers, eating, etc. Trying to ban each and every distraction one by one is a ridiculous and impossible task. In fact, studies have suggested that bad distracted drivers will often just find a different distraction to occupy their time. And, thanks to these laws, those drivers are often still texting while driving, but are simply holding their phones even lower, taking their eyes further off the road, so as to avoid detection... actually making the roads more dangerous. The real answer is to focus on stopping bad driving, not trying to call out specific activities.*\n\nhttps://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20130405/02103822591/california-court-rules-it-illegal-to-check-maps-your-phone-while-driving.shtml","Good luck, mate.

And, thanks to these laws, those drivers are often still texting while driving, but are simply holding their phones even lower, taking their eyes further off the road, so as to avoid detection... actually making the roads more dangerous.

If it's not, then yes there should be enforcement of the limit.\n\nThe more grey area, personal discretion/interpretation, and inconsistent enforcement there is, the greater opportunity exists for abuse, bias, and ill-informed civilians.

In the case of speed limit signs, it would be much more confusing to convey the intent of the law if they have multiple conditions and if they change every 100m.

It could be raining so lightly you don't even need wipers, or it could be a downpour with slick roads. It could be dead night with no moon or barely dusk. I think these complications are better left to a court of law, and it seems that most countries agree.

Thus texting and driving looks really bad, when those accidents were probably going to happen irregardless. \n\nIncorrect. I see older people (not teenagers) all the time who are *swerving* out of their lanes on the road, because they're looking down at their phones. \n\nEven looking away from the road for as little as 1 or 2 seconds can have terrible consequences, if it happens at just the wrong time. And being overly-distracted by passengers *could* also be dangerous-- but usually not as dangerous as texting and driving.\n\nThis isn't unfairly singling out or punishing young people. This is singling out and punishing people who think they don't have to pay full attention while driving a two ton death machine at 40+ MPH on a public street. ","I agree not paying attention to the road is bad. However to look at your phone for half a second to figure out where your thumb is exactly on your phone is just as bad as looking over at your passenger.  I think you should always be focused on the road. It's why I don't turn my car stereo past 5 (it's on a scale of 35), or why I don't make eye contact with passengers, or why I choose my radio station before I start driving. I don't believe it's fair to outlaw one activity in your car, but not all of the others.\n\nAs for talking to passengers being a distraction but not as bad as texting, I ask how so? Both result in you taking your eyes off of the road, and your mind focusing on a conversation.","Same thing in Houston. The left lane is the slowest lane unless the freeway is completely clear. Whenever I'm carpooling on the HOV I take a look to my right and a good 40% of people are using the phone while driving. I'm sure it's a huge cause of traffic in Houston because the phone users are always driving slower than the rest of the freeway or just leaving ridiculous gaps in front of them. There's always traffic even when there are no incidents and it's not rush hour on a weekday. ","Is this a... what day is this?","I never understood that when I lived in Houston. The left lane is supposed to be the fast, passing lane. Why is it so slow in Houston? ","The issue is everyone wants into the fast lane, so cars merge in thinking they're going to get around everyone. Oops, someone didn't leave a big enough gap, need to slow down to make that cushion in front. Now everyone behind has to slow down slightly, which amplifies due to reaction time coupled with the smart-ass on their phone that doesn't realize the need to slow down until they are on someone's bumper, then they hit their brakes, causing a traffic jam that builds and slowly ripples back through traffic, becoming worse and worse as time progresses. All of this avoidable if people left gaps large enough for vehicles to safely merge into their lane, people not trying to go faster than the car in front of them then slamming on the brakes, and drivers not distracted by cellphones, passengers, pets, or sun glinting off an airplane over the horizon.  \n  \n  \nEdit: Here's a shockwave traffic jam explaination: https://youtu.be/Suugn-p5C1M","So why is it only Houston?

So many different things a cop can do to provide tons of evidence in court that you can't get around.

Guard Sergeant, AR Belyakov 24 kills.*  \n  \n**Total number of confirmed kills: 775**  \n  \nBecause of chronic problems in finding the manpower to fulfill military and industrial tasks, the Soviet Government recruited some 7.75 million women, of whom 800,000 served in the military. Sniping was a precision role, which many women soldiers performed with expertise. It is estimated that in 1943 there were more than 2000 female snipers in the Soviet armed forces. Female snipers have been credited with more than 12,000 confirmed kills.  \n  \nThe Soviet Union used women for sniping duties extensively, and to great effect, including Nina Alexeyevna Lobkovskaya and Ukrainian Lyudmila Pavlichenko (who killed over 300 enemy soldiers). The Soviets found that sniper duties fit women well, since good snipers are patient, careful, deliberate, can avoid hand-to-hand combat, and need higher levels of aerobic conditioning than other troops. Women were regarded as having the skills and nerves required for accurate marksmanship. Notwithstanding male skepticism, Major General Morozov, “the father of the sniper movement”, attributed superior female marksmanship to the fact that “a woman’s hand is more sensitive than is a man’s. Therefore when a woman is shooting, her index finger pulls the trigger more smoothly and purposefully”.  \n  \nThe most successful Soviet use of snipers during the second world war were during their defensive stages of the war (1941–1943), after which the advantage of defense shifted to the German side and German snipers became a real danger to the advancing Soviets. Soviet military doctrine used snipers for providing long-distance suppressive fire and for eliminating targets of opportunity, especially leaders, because during World War II, Soviet military leaders and combat theorists (Vassili Zaitsev contributed greatly to Soviet sniper doctrine, although he was officially neither of these) found that military organizations have difficulty replacing experienced non-commissioned officers and field officers during times of war. They also found that the more expensive and less rugged sniper rifles could match the cost-effectiveness of a cheaper assault rifle given good personnel selection, training, and adherence to doctrine.  \n  \n","&gt; Total number of confirmed kills: 775 \n\nNo doubt these women were great soldiers, but keep in mind the Soviet numbers were often inflated for propaganda purposes. Just look at [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_snipers) and sort it by \"Confirmed Kills\".","Sometimes \"the claims of Soviet numbers inflated for propaganda purposes\" really gets on my nerves. Are the Soviet numbers really that badly inflated compared to other armies' numbers? Simo Häyhä (which appears on reddit every other day) is often cited as having almost ridiculously many confirmed kills, even though A) Finnish snipers didn't use a standardized spotting and confirming system during the Winter War and B) Simo Häyhä was a media celebrity already during the war, which makes stories about him highly susceptible to patriotic inflation.","Agreed, my history teacher often did this in highschool and he would put any Soviety advancement down a notch with some sort of wild claim. For example, he mentioned that they stole the designs for the Space Shuttle rather than just recreate it using pictures.","It's always healthy to be suspicious towards wartime propaganda, and *especially* that of totalitarian regimes such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, but sometimes it feels like the age-old stereotype that Eastern Europeans in general and Russians in particular are a faceless horde of slow-witted peons, incapable of any achievements beyond enduring copious amounts of stress and mindless obedience, is all too much alive in the world today.","\"Kills\" is even pretty misleading. Typically they would count it as confirmed if someone else saw the hit, usually the spotter. \n\nHitting does not equate to killing though and you are not going to find someone to run over to the enemy territory to find out if the guy you just shot is dead or not. ","And atop all those Russians, just to spite them, Simo Häyhä with the exact number of 505.","Which is probably also wildly inflated but he's not a Soviet, so this is not mentioned...","Finnish TV did a documentary movie about him, where they said that in reality he killed something like 200 people.","Still a decent K/D","Not even counting assists.","AKA kill steals in War Thunder","Simo Hayha was a hero who did all that could be expected of him and more in defense of his homeland.

Thought confirmed meant that it's found to be 100% true.","If I remember Chris Kyle's book correctly you need to actually see them die. So if you shoot a guy in a window and see him go down, it's not confirmed because you could have shot him in the shoulder. Need to find the body or confirm in another way. \n\nAlso I believe confirmed kills require a witness/signature. So solo sniping makes confirmed kills difficult. ","Snipers usually have a spotter with them. A kill is confirmed only if executed in the presence of another soldier who witnesses the kill. Carlos Hathcock and other prominent snipers probably have higher kill counts than what is confirmed, because a kill is only confirmed by a witness.","Thanks, that makes sense.","That means that he shot them and probably killed them but no one actually went up to the body and confirmed they were dead.","The dead targets got better?","Even if it's inflated, it bears to remember that he was active for only *100 days* during the Winter War, whereas the Soviet snipers on the wiki page were active for several years.","... Which really says more about the incompetence of the Soviet command during the Winter War (to present such a huge number of easy pickings for Finnish marksmen) than gives any indication of Häyhä's skill compared to Soviet snipers during the war against Germany.","every time somebody suggests this, people always try to counter with, \"no you see he was ugly so it has to be true\"","I don't know, I don't think it's that unbelievable for a sniper to kill five Soviets a day during the Winter War. They weren't exactly elite troops. The Soviet numbers are more dubious as all kills would be against the Wehrmacht. ","Well, on the flip side of that Hayha was active for like 4 months or something vs. (potentially) years for Soviet snipers. The Red Army was also massively larger than every other military in the ETO, and had the whole \"cult of the sniper\" thing going on, so it wouldn't be surprising if quite a few of the top scoring snipers were soviets. ","Well it's about ratios right? If the Red Army if fighting an enemy that about the same size, then it is less likely that one person would get a high amount of kills. It was also far more difficult to get a kill when fighting the Germans than it was fighting the 1939 Soviets. The Soviets generally lack credibility as in many instances it is blatant that they are lying such as [Vasily Zaytsev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Zaytsev). The Wikipedia article on him is a mess of \"citation needed\"s and his principle accomplishment detailed in \"Enemy at the Gates\" is killing a German sniper that doesn't exist. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that Simo Haya  had a lot of training as a member of the Civil Guard. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Finland had much of a propaganda machine. ","Well the Finnish Army didn't use a standardized spotter and confirmation system for their snipers during the winter war (and finnish 'snipers' were actually more like marksmen, i.e. regular infantrymen who were selected by officers for their marksman skills. In other words: lacking any kind of 'formal' sniper training *unlike* the Soviet snipers). Also, all the figures I've seen of Häyhä's kills have been from Finnish wartime media, and anyone who thinks that Finnish media during the winter war *didn't* contain a fair share of inflated jingoist fables for morale purposes is pretty gullible.","Man that page always freaks me out.

Wiki says nothing about it. ","The Soviets designated units with distinguished service the title of 'Guard'. That designation was added to all officer titles too. In this case it means a sergeant in the 59th Guards Rifle Regiment (21st Guards Rifle Division, 3rd Shock Army, 2nd Baltic Front)","did shock armies have more armor? like say a panzer army vs a regular German army?","It would have depended on the year and the army in question. Shock armies were the units designated to make the most sweeping advances during attack phases so early on in the war (1941-ish) they often attempted to consolidate more mobile mechanized and armoured equipment, but just as often they utilized light rifle brigades. There was also a preference for heavier artillery to help smash though German lines during the advance, but again it depended heavily on what could be spared at any particular time.\n\nIt was only really the middle-years when shock armies received priority access to heavy armour and artillery. By that time they were used to make the initial breakthrough while medium armour and infantry exploited deep battle doctrine.\n\nBy the end of the war shock armies were only really different in name since it was easier and faster to transfer specialized units between armies than move the armies themselves. That becomes particularly true once specific tank and mechanized armies began to form from 1942 onwards, leaving shock armies less able to exploit breakthroughs by comparison and relegated to combat in areas tanks were less suited like cities or as rapid combined-arms support to the tank units. ","Shock Armies were basically purpose built for large scale engagements, you would be correct in saying they were provided with more armor, but they are not like a Panzer core vs a Wehrmacht infantry core. The Shock Armies had tank and infantry units within the, It was a combined arms unit, more mechanized than your average Red Army group, more tanks, more artillery, and a hell of a lot more trucks, they were used to try and hit large German forces and shatter them, hence the \"shock\" name. This one in particular went through Warsaw, had action in Prussia, in eventually would be the major force in taking Berlin.","&gt; Shock Armies were basically purpose built for large scale engagements\n\ncompared to what? what else would armies be purpose built to do? occupy territory? or does your comment mean offensive-only large scale engagements (not concerned with defensive operations)?","You misunderstand, I'm talking about large battles for the Eastern Front. The largest battles in human history were fought during this time period, normal armies were meant for engaging units similar to themselves in size. Blitzkrieg changed all that by grouping tanks together as opposed to distributing them as support for infantry, so tanks would move in concentration and fight decisive battles with the support of shock infantry. Shock armies were the Russian counter, massive in terms of size and strength, the Shock army meant the Germans couldn't exploit a weak point in the line, if they tried to launch a major offensive, they would be met by a huge, well supplied, well supported army. the concept was modified t be more offensive as the wars tide turned, or at least thats what Zhukov has said of it in his books. What happened at these decisive battles would direct what happened across the rest of the front. This doctrine was mostly based on the gigantic engagements the eastern front had, and was a mostly Russian concept because the other Allies weren't managing a front that massive, and for the most part, weren't fighting battles this big. The Shock Army doctrine fell out of use after the war because wars just *havent been that big since then.*(thank god)","My guess would be a Sergeant in a Soviet Guard unit.

No doubt Hayha is one of the most skilled snipers ever, but he was in a position where he'd get into a perfect position (that's part of a snipers skill set) and then when he started picking off infantry, they didn't stop coming, they flank or coordinate properly, and were receiving stupid orders from inexperienced, incompetent leaders, being directed poorly by inexperienced NCO's and CO's.

The eastern front was a far more brutal war than the one the British and Americans fought. Roughly 27 million Soviets died during world war 2. More than 10 million soldiers and another 10 million civilans died during the fighting. 6 million more succumbed to disease and starvation. During such a brutal hellish conflict every able body was needed.  EDIT: Wow, apparently the idea that sending women to fight wasn't the Red Army's first choice is not a popular one. ","It was not the only reason. Gender equality and the importance of women having equal duties and rights was a big part of the communist ideology in he early Soviet Union.

It happened more often early in the war, Stalin ordered any man who retreated to be shot in one order call \"Not a step back\". But as time wore on, even the most fervent Stalin supporters realized it was not advantageous to be killing your own men. Some commanders at Stalingrad were known for killing their own men, and some for sending men into combat unarmed or without ammo, but this is overplayed in most media. In reality, the problem was there were few competent officers early in the war due to Stalins Purges, hence why the Russians suffered so greatly in the winter war. As time went on in the war, good NCO's and CO's started to rise up in the army for bravery and zeal, and you'll notice at the end of the war, the Red Army was extremely competent, with most of their massive losses and captures coming at the beginning phase of Operation Barbarossa, when millions of Red Army soldiers were captured and sent to camps where they would not survive.","Not at all.

Until war or crisis hits close to where you live, you might go the majority of your entire life without experiencing the darker side of inhibition and typically that's because, outside of times of war or martial law, that kind of inhibition is illegal... and people who are used to rules and normality and a relative amount of security are generally freaked out when they encounter someone who is willing to let the darker side of inhibition express itself as the state removes the sanction of illegality.

","Why single out Bernie supporters? Trumpers are downvoting Hillary stuff at least as fervently, if not way more. ","And they also bitch about Bernie supporters not joining Trump while doing it too. It's really funny to see them calling Bernie voters pussies and saying they should join Trump eventhough it's pretty clear Bernie himself would rather vote any Democrat than let a conservative take the WH.","As I have understood US politics; you vote against the one you like the least. So I think some Bernie supporters have more hate for Clinton than Trump. The rest might not vote at all. I do not think most will join team Clinton if Bernie loses.","&gt; during the 2008 presidential election, where May exit polls in Indiana had 50% of Hillary Clinton supporters saying they’d vote McCain or stay home. In March, Gallup had 28% of Clinton supporters voting for McCain instead of Obama. The same poll had 19% of Obama supporters who said they would vote for McCain over Hillary. By the time the primaries were over, CNN had 35% of Clinton supporters nationally saying they wouldn’t support Obama.\n\nWe all know who won in '08.\n\nIf Trump is able to sway 15% of current Bernie supporters, he will pull off a major coup in modern politics.

LITERALLY DOZENS","lol I love how your comment is controversial just because you hinted at supporting hilary. You didn't even say her name or post anything negative.","Dozens of us on reddit, and apparently enough to win the nomination and general election outside of it.\n\nBut for real though, I can't wait to see how this election turns out. /r/politics basically shifts into being an anti-Hillary subreddit anytime she wins a state... so like every few days. I can't wait to see what the sub looks like in September or August. I'm also pretty curious to see what role Bernie Sanders will have after the convention, if he'll become a Clinton surrogate for party unity like what Hillary did after Obama was nominated. I wonder if he'll end up getting a higher end position in her cabinet, his message is the future of the Democratic Party--it's just that Hillary and Obama are the present. I can't wait to see how things turn out.","I'm predicting that /r/politics will either become a Trump subreddit, a Jill Stein subreddit, or at the very least a #neverHillary subreddit. She is the penultimate example of everything the average millenial hates in politics, I just don't forsee the subreddit turning in her favor.","It's always going to be cancer, the default subs always are. I think Clinton supporters might become the silent majority, or a group of Bernie supporters to say, \"Bernie is my first choice, but Clinton is alright I guess, she's not an awful second choice.\" Which is basically how I thought from October to a few weeks ago.\n\nIt'll become a war of Trump v. #FuckTrump. I don't see Jill Stein becoming popular, she's too far left for most Democrats who like Bernie, she's too far left for most Independents who like Bernie. She'll attract her club of people, but the Green Party hasn't accomplished much of anything ever. No senators, no congressmen, ect. Even the Libertarians have had Governor houses and the occasional seat of power somewhere. If she becomes popular then it's just going to be 2000 all over again.\n\nOn a side note, what has voting 3rd party every done? As a protest vote no one in history has ever heard or considered that protest. It's never forced a political party to change or take notice. It would make a lot more sense voting against the guy you don't like and then in the off-season dumping money into people like Bernie Sanders who by all means shouldn't vanish and trying to get something like the Alternative Vote system in place. From there you can vote out the establishment parties without fear that you're really weakening your Left or Right leaning candidates to fall easily to the opposition.","Not true- the populist parties of the late 1800's and early 1900's caused a huge shift in the politics of the day that we can still feel the effects of, and even before that, the Republican party started out as a third party in the fairly well established \"Wigs vs Democrats\" contest of the day, and when the Dixie-crats broke off from the Democrats, two \"third party\" parties essentially caused the civil war. \n\nNowadays, of course, the parties are much more entrenched than they used to be, and we should get rid of the first past the post voting system, but don't count out the sway of third parties.\n","Politics was removed from being default because of how cancerous it has always been","The silent majority that's voting clinton are 65+ older folks who don't know much about the internet yo. Not sure on the exact number if it's between 55+ or 65+ but I know it's been proven time and time again she's really *really* unpopular with anyone young. \n\nCaucus voters are not representative of the overall majority, it takes someone really invested in politics to go to caucuses, and a lot of free time to go there in person. Most people didn't even know what a caucus was in the first place. \n\nIMO - I don't even think it's her fault on being despised by the young, there's a rising tide of hate against politics in a nutshell and she happens to be a person that falls into the stereotype perfectly, like the poster child for corrupt politics and shady businesses. There's thousands others that are far far worse than Hillary, and if they had run - they'd be the ones hated right now, not Hillary. She's just happens to be in the spotlight.","I'm probably going to end up voting for Jill Stein anyways, but even if it becomes a Jill Stein sub, I'm unsubscribing.

However for myself since I view the Democratic primary as pretty much over she is the candidate closest to my views that actually has a decent chance of winning.

","Well, she's the only candidate running with four open federal investigations.","Just four? Hah, what a casual.

His camp just claims that they don't specifically target comments so it's totally cool. \n\nAnd people were calling anybody who didn't shit on Hillary shills since way before that story came out. ","No that was a pro Hilary super PAC that announced such plans. Super PAC's are seperate entities from official campaigns.

She's probably ok in that case.","This campaign is from David Brock's SuperPAC, the one where they found a loophole that allows them to coordinate with the campaign. So you really can't claim she has nothing to do with it, any more than we can claim that she does. Nobody knows.","You are not quite right about that:\n\n\n&gt;Due to FEC loopholes, the Sunlight Foundation’s Libby Watson found this year that Correct the Record can openly coordinate with Clinton’s campaign, despite rules that typically disallow political campaigns from working directly with PACs.\n“SuperPACs aren’t supposed to coordinate with candidates. The whole reasoning behind (Supreme Court decision) Citizens United rests on (PACs) being independent, but Correct the Record claims it can coordinate,” Watson told The Daily Beast. “It’s not totally clear what their reasoning is, but it seems to be that material posted on the Internet for free—like, blogs—doesn’t count as an ‘independent expenditure.’”","And Bernie has paid [Revolution Media $16 million](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/4/22/1518673/-Bernie-Sanders-employs-online-trolls-via-Revolution-Messaging-They-are-still-hiring) to do the same thing. ","It is not a disregard for due process, it is a distrust of due process. When observing Hillary's lifetime in politics, there is evidence that time after time, the Clintons seem to be obviously tied to some ethically questionable activity. And, time after time, they beat the wrap. This confirms the notion that the rich and politically well connected are elbows deep in one another's pockets, and this entire rigged system never changes because they all profit in the end. And this profit comes at the expense of the poor masses - especially those who can most easily be convinced to vote against their own interest. IMHO","Oh come on, there is so much legitimate criticism, e.g. her not releasing her Wallstreet transcripts.

They have different interpretations of these rights, but they both would agree with the statement \"human rights exist\".  Not every classical liberal interprets human rights the same way: even among the founders of classical liberalism like Adam Smith and Volatire there were ideological differences.

I wonder if he'll end up getting a higher end position in her cabinet, his message is the future of the Democratic Party--it's just that Hillary and Obama are the present.\n\nYou could very well be correct about this, but I don't think he's going to go down that quietly. I can see him running as an independent. Think about it: a lot of people are terrified of a Trump vs Hillary election. He could not only campaign as an alternative to either of them, he could market himself as the killer of the two party system. Obviously one election won't kill the two party system, but if he can associate a vote for him with an act of rebellion against the status quo, he could attract a sizable number of voters. IMO, this is the perfect storm for a third party candidate to get elected. The only way this could be better is if Bernie's economic platform was more moderate.","Bernie Sanders isn't a Democrat, he doesn't really have the motivations to keeping the Democratic Party together like Hillary did in 2008. But, he's the most liberal politician in the Senate and I don't think he wants the Republicans to sweep the White House. He personally said he'd support Hillary if she wins the nomination, and recently he said he'd need to look at her platform to see if he'd consider supporting her (he doesn't know her platform, really?) I'm guessing before he decides he'll sit down with Sec. Clinton and talk about how things are going to go down, maybe she'll adopt some of his platforms and he'll endorse her.\n\nOtherwise, he'd probably run as Jill Stein's VP. He won't go independant, I don't think.\n\nIf Trump himself goes independant and its: Cruz vs Hillary vs Trump vs Bernie this could be interesting.","That's true, the threat of having Trump as president is probably more of a risk than he's willing to take to win. I know he said he would back her, but with the stabs he has taken at her and the things he has said about the DNC makes me uncertain as to what he'll do. I can definitely see Clinton taking some things from his platform, specifically the emphasis on ending the \"War on Drugs.\" I wonder if she'll try to make him her VP to attract some of his voters...\n\nA Cruz-Trump-Sanders-Clinton four way deathmatch would easily be the most interesting elections we have ever had. If I wasn't so opposed to having Trump as president, I would love to have that happen.","Not american, but that last bit is what I want to see.  Seems like if that happened and each got a decent amount of votes, serious election reform would have to happen b/c it would be blatantly obvious that two parties is not enough.","I have to agree. If somehow it becomes those four guys running it would implode the current voting system we have.

Which would mean flat out invalidating the vote of about 90% of the Republican voters in the primaries (who voted either Cruz or Trump).

Uncle Donnie will be disappointed. ","I think Sanders has a better chance against Trump than Hillary does","You're welcome to believe that. But I have two arguments against that. \n\nOne is that even if it where true that Sanders is more likely to beat Trump he's not likely at all to beat Clinton. Outside of Clinton having charges brought against her or some other disaster she's extremely likely to be the nominee. [Betting markets currently have her at 96% chance of winning the nomination.](http://predictwise.com/politics/2016-president-democratic-nomination) Which have historically been quite accurate at this stage. And if Sanders runs third party he basically hands the presidency to the Republicans. So whether or not Sanders can do better against Trump is kind of irrelevant in my mind.\n\nAnd secondly polls showing Sanders beating Trump can't be taken seriously this far out. For one thing Sanders winning independent voters in the primaries  doesn't mean much because independent does not mean moderate. It's the independent moderates that are what are really fought over in the general election. And then we have the issue that Clinton has barely attacked Sanders. In the general he'll be smeared non stop and you'll see any polling advantage drop real fast. I mean for god's sake [Sanders spent his honeymoon in the Soviet Union](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/12/george-will/george-will-reminds-readers-about-bernie-sanders-u/) I can barely imagine how much that would be twisted against him and that's just the tip of the iceberg of things he can be attacked on. ","if that happens, I think a lot more sanders supporters are gonna go to trump than the party thinks. \n\n if they were wise, they'd use their superdelegates to give the nomination to sanders","Wait if what happens? If Clinton wins a majority of votes they should give the nomination to Sanders? I mean any rational person would agree that if she's actually charged with crimes than giving the nomination would absolutely be the right thing to do. \n\nBut if Clinton isn't charged with any crimes than the Democratic Party must absolutely honor the will of the majority and nominate her. And I'd say the same thing if Sanders was winning. \n\nWe could talk all day about alleged voter suppression but like it or not the polls have closely matched the results in all states except Michigan where Sanders won. You are suggesting the disenfranchisement of millions of people who actually did go out and vote more than those who supported Sanders. That's not simply unreasonable that is disgusting. \n\nAnd the Bernie or Bust crowd is similar to the PUMA's of 2008. A vocal minority who where ironically in support of Clinton. What ended up happening was the vast majority fell in line. I expect the same to happen because as a candidate Clinton has much more in common with Sanders than Trump does.

If you're paying a worker 10 dollars per hour to peel and core and slice 3 apples per minute (extremely optimistic estimate, although im making shit up here) you're paying ~5.5 cents per apple. If the machine costs 750 dollars  and 15 cents per hour to run, it basically pays for itself after 40,000 apples (by my drunk math that I was unable to recount how i arrived at the conclusion to), or 120 hours of use. Of course the amount you're profiting off of the cored and peeled apples affects this too but excluding that I'm fairly confident that my math is wrong. If anyone wants to correct me go ahead, but until then I'm pretty sure this machine is a great investment.

It may take roughly 10-12 seconds to peel a single apple, but the machine is doing 3 apples in parallel. I counted 4 seconds between him putting each apple on(which is where I got 12 sec from, 3*4).

I'd do a box of apples a day for various deserts but mostly plain pies, cobblers and danishes, with a portion set aside for ice cream or other desert combos. I'm just guessing here, my memory is foggy going back that far, but I think it was about 75 apples a box, and I'd finish that in about 5-7 minutes.  After you're done all that I'd end up with an extra step where i'd go over them with a knife, sometimes rough, sometimes precise, depending on whatever needs were.  that would only take an extra 1-2 minutes.\n\nthat's probably between 7 and 9 apples a minute.  At that rate I couldn't really go more than 10 minutes but it seems about right to my recollection.  The tool I used probably cost about $40, Canadian.

Of course, every now and then you get a ripe bit that just won't co-operate but i bet that kind of thing would muck up the OP's machine too.","how hard would it be to repurpose an existing machine and modify it slightly to be able to load the machines up. If you had 100 of these machines and 3 or 4 people supervising an automated system that would load these apples into a machine (we're assuming that you already have people loading the apples for the machine's human counterpart to begin with) i can easily see the machines being more efficient.

I'M JUST GUESSING HERE, MY MEMORY IS FOGGY GOING BACK THAT FAR, BUT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT 75 APPLES A BOX, AND I'D FINISH THAT IN ABOUT 5-7 MINUTES.  AFTER YOU'RE DONE ALL THAT I'D END UP WITH AN EXTRA STEP WHERE I'D GO OVER THEM WITH A KNIFE, SOMETIMES ROUGH, SOMETIMES PRECISE, DEPENDING ON WHATEVER NEEDS WERE.  THAT WOULD ONLY TAKE AN EXTRA 1-2 MINUTES.\n\n#THAT'S PROBABLY BETWEEN 7 AND 9 APPLES A MINUTE.  AT THAT RATE I COULDN'T REALLY GO MORE THAN 10 MINUTES BUT IT SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT TO MY RECOLLECTION.  THE TOOL I USED PROBABLY COST ABOUT $40, CANADIAN.  THEY TEND TO LAST IF YOU CARE FOR THEM TOO.\n\n#EDIT: REVIEWING THAT VIDEO THE PERSON WENT REALLY REALLY SLOW AND WAS SET UP W/ MIP ALL WRONG.  I GOT REALLY GOOD AT USING IT AND YOU KIND OF SETTLE INTO A QUICK RHYTHM, THERE'S EVEN A LITTLE TRICK KIND OF WHEN YOU SLIDE THE SCREW BACK WITH THE RIGHT SPEED AND FINESSE AND THE CORE FLIES OFF IN THE SAME DIRECTION MORE OR LESS WHERE YOU SET YOUR BIN UP TO COLLECT THE PEELS.  OF COURSE, EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU GET A RIPE BIT THAT JUST WON'T CO-OPERATE BUT I BET THAT KIND OF THING WOULD MUCK UP THE OP'S MACHINE TOO.\n***\n\n##[^^^I ^^^am ^^^a ^^^bot, ^^^and ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^respond ^^^to ^^^myself.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CantHearYouBot/)","r/theydidthemath","I was thinking it looked too big and slow to be practical. Maybe if it held more apples at once and didn't require a human. I still don't know what all could be packed into that metal box. ","I think there would be another machine sticking the apples onto that fork instead of a human. And it might even work with bigger speed, idk. ","There is just a low paid worker inside cranking it.","I guess it would really depend on the operation using the machine.  If you're making let's say only a hundred apple pies a day, which is likely for a bakery, then I could imagine it would be worth the investment.  Now for a really big commercial bakery that's making thousands of pies at a time, you might want to go with bigger and faster equipment.\n\nI cook professionally and the thought of peeling hundreds of apples by hand sounds ridiculously tedious.","I've worked in bakeries where we used apples in the hundreds, not thousands. We just bought them pre-peeled and sliced, in 15kg boxes. At most we'd need to chop them up a bit more for specific recipies. \n\nIf a trained baker takes 10 mins to process 1kg of apples, and he's paid $15 per hour, the ready processed ones would need to cost $2.50 more per kg to break even.
