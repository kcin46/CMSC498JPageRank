{"photoshopbattles":[],"science":[["The title of the BBC article, and by extension this post (sorry OP), seems supremely click-baity.\n\nThe most common theory about the cause of Type I diabetes is that it is an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks and destroys cells in the pancreas. One of the key features of the adaptive immune system is the ability to distinguish 'self' from 'foreign'. This property is key to fighting off pathogenic invaders. And in Type I diabetes, the idea is that the adaptive immune system is \"confused\" and \"thinks\" that certain proteins/carbohydrates expressed by cells in the pancreas are from foreign pathogens. So it destroys them.\n\nThe major advance of this paper is that it finds another commonly \"confusing\" protein that often triggers the adaptive immune system to attack the pancreatic cells. This will by no means be the last such molecule identified by researchers. And it by no means provides a complete picture of the areas the immune system attacks in Type I diabetes.\n\nThe whole \"five major auto-antigen\" narrative in the article is also a bit laughable. I can think of plenty of auto-antigens not named by the authors, such as: heat shock protein, islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein, PDX1, chromogranin A and more.\n\nCool research. Has potential therapeutic implications. Terrible title.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people lamenting how breakthrough research never lives up to the hype. I look at it like this: If Reddit was around in the 1920's there would have been a post, *Canadian researcher isolate small peptide from pancreas of dogs; use it to cure diabetes*.\n\nSince that was the foundation of insulin therapy, I say keep swinging for the fences. The nice thing about breakthroughs is that it just takes one good one to really shake everything up.","As someone with an incurrable illness, SirT6's edit has it right.

I was diagnosed with mild Graves' disease a few years ago, but it's been in remission for a couple of years. \n\nI get migraines that often feel like somebody's kicking the back of my eyeball (usually one side at a time), and often wonder if my immune system is up to no good.

Apparently migraines can be much more than that - I have a mixed bag of symptoms that run from seeing things that aren't there and hearing loss to speech disturbance and episodes of exhaustion all of which can go on for weeks.

","Systemic fungal infection seems a plausibly common complication with diabetes.\n\nFungal cells penetrate mechanisms that regulate sugar metabolism, perhaps to increase their own livelihood (fungi eat sugars). The body then attacks those mechanisms that it now believes are foreign due to the fungal proteins they contain.\n\nAnd presto, autoimmune disease.\n\n&gt;In the present study, we show that corpora amylacea from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) contain fungal proteins as detected by immunohistochemistry analyses. ... Additionally, CNS samples from patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) also contained CA that were immunoreactive with a range of antifungal antibodies. However, CA were less abundant in ALS or PD patients as compared to CNS samples from AD. By contrast, CA from brain tissue of control subjects were almost devoid of fungal immunoreactivity.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27013948\n\n&gt;The possibility that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has a microbial aetiology has been proposed by several researchers. Here, we provide evidence that tissue from the central nervous system (CNS) of AD patients contain fungal cells and hyphae. Fungal material can be detected both intra- and extracellularly using specific antibodies against several fungi. Different brain regions including external frontal cortex, cerebellar hemisphere, entorhinal cortex/hippocampus and choroid plexus contain fungal material, which is absent in brain tissue from control individuals. Analysis of brain sections from ten additional AD patients reveals that all are infected with fungi. Fungal infection is also observed in blood vessels, which may explain the vascular pathology frequently detected in AD patients. Sequencing of fungal DNA extracted from frozen CNS samples identifies several fungal species.\n\nDifferent Brain Regions are Infected with Fungi in Alzheimer’s Disease  \nhttp://www.nature.com/articles/srep15015","My left eye optic nerve got a bit of a chew itself some years ago and has a stable blind spot in the center ever since.

(you use them until they are done with, lasts me about a week per pen). \n\nLook, if i have one shot at giving some advice. Diabetes is scary at first, but you soon get used to it. This comes at a cost. In the first decade it's easy enough to have, as you feel absolute nothing from what happens after 20 years. His life is not over, but he will feel invincible \"this is not so bad\" at first. If I could go back and slap the younger me over the head with how I should have taken better care of myself, I would.\n\nIt's the long term, slow things that get you, and you won't know that until it's late to fix them. If you can find some people who have had it for a long time, those are the ones that can give the best advice. Showing pictures of amputated legs is not going to help, but knowing that your will get ED eventually might.

What's better for a diabetic is what works for them and what let's them maintain homeostasis with their disease. ","what works for me is what my insurance pays for.","True but most diabetics don't have a price difference for insulin as it's covered by national or private health insurance. When I lived in Australia it was the same price regardless of type, and in the UK it's all free.","Yeah the experience of type 1 diabetics is a lot different in the states where a monthly bill for your meds and supplies can often be $400 or more.

We don't understand autoimmune diseases well enough.\n\nHowever, treatment is getting better and better, and taking less input from the individual. The \"bionic pancreas\" that's hopefully coming in the next few years is a massive step in that direction. I was lucky enough to meet one of the guys involved in working with it and he told me stories about going to restaurants, ordering whatever he wanted, and not having to think about taking insulin, the pump did it for him. Incredible.","They've been talking about this bionic pancreas shit for years, though, including trials and patients wearing it outside of clinical settings, and stuff. It's been going on for a least a decade, with the same 5-years-away stuff being said the whole time. \n\nAs a type 1 consumer, it's just as much pie-in-the-sky for me as a cure. \n\nMaybe one of these days it won't be.","A glorified pump+CGM combo is not a cure for me.

","Definitely. But the viacyte implant looks very promising too.","He described the process to me. The first time you get put on it, you input your body weight (I believe that was it). From that point on, a CGM tracks your bloodsugar and provides microdoses of insulin and glucagon (they had gone as far as hiring a laboratory to create a more stable form of glucagon that could last outside of a refrigerator for weeks or months, can't remember the exact length of time). He told me that after the first day of being on it, his bloodsugar did not go above 200, regardless of what he ate. He was on it for a month.

Once one of the many groups studying these finds an optimal combination we will in essence have a cure for t1d.","Because stopping the immune system is hard. I'd love a cure, I just don't think it's very likely to happen soon.\n\nAnyways, with stuff like the bionic pancreas coming along, diabetes will be little more than an afterthought if it works as well as I've been shown.","Having a bunch of electronics hanging off your body is not an afterthought. Having to refill the supplies all the time is not an afterthought. Not having enough space on your body to comfortably rotate pump sites is not an afterthought. Paying thousands of dollars a year in medical expenses even when on insurance is certainly not an afterthought. \n\nI agree with your skepticism regarding a true cure. But the \"bionic pancreas\" or \"artificial pancreas\" phrase pisses me off. There is so much hassle, inconvenience, challenge, and risk that comes with managing T1 diabetes, even if the pump/CGM combo gets smarter. ","Transplanting islet cells elsewhere in the body may be enough to trick the immune system, without the need to stop it. It might not work, but if it cures even just 10% of people to fully non-diabetic status, I'd call that a win. And if it cures no-one, maybe we get data out of it.

But I really don't think it is.","You know what's even more expensive? Being the pharmaceutical company that isn't first to market with the cure.","Actually there's lots of incentive for a cure. Diabetes has been around so long that it's actually pretty cheap (comparatively) to treat. Someone comes up with a cure and could easily charge orders of magnitude more than the treatment, as long as it's less than the lifetime cost of treatment. For 20-25 years they have an exclusive right to produce the cure (or license it as they see fit) and make billions.\n\nAlso it's not necessarily pharma that's doing this research but universities and public health agencies who are in it for the bragging rights and the almost certain Nobel prize. It's been almost 100 years since Banting isolated insulin and successfully treated his first batch of patients but your still remember his name.","Ease to treat, sure. Insulin costs pennies to make (exaggerating, but it's not that expensive to make), and test strips are very cheap to make..... but the disease is EXTREMELY costly to have as an individual in a backwards country with no universal healthcare (#muricathegreat). My insulin is jacked up to almost 100 bucks a vial, each test strip costs me WITH INSURANCE 5 bucks per strip. If I did the minimum 4 tests a day, that is 20 dollars a day. That's 140 per week. That's 7 thousand a year, and that doesn't cover the costs of all the other medications that come with diabetes. \n\nBut yes, cheap to treat, expensive to have. ","Your mileage may differ, but without insurance, the cost of insulin pens and test strips can easily be $6,000 a year. If a cure could be had for $60,000 that would pale compared to 50 or 60 years of dependence. Sorry, Banting's name is not that well known. It is in the pharmaceutical industry's interest to tweak treatments so they can continue to sell third tier drugs instead of tier 1 generics. I agree that universities or public health agencies have more incentive to find a cure","What about the story out of Harvard last year saying they now have the ability to mass produce synthetic beta cells and were working on getting approval for testing? I think at the time they said they were about 3 years out from beginning human trials...\n\nedit: here's the article\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/10/diabetes-stem-cell-type-1-breakthrough-harvard\n\nHas anyone heard anything new on this?","Is there going to be any actual movement on cures yet?  They've been saying that's right around the corner for decades now, and my brother is running out of time.","There's no current research that has found a cure (if you read otherwise, it's lies). The closest things to cures at the moment are having an islet transplant from someone else (you need to be on immunosupressants for the rest of your life and after 5-15 years the islets can fail and you're back to the start again) and the closed-loop insulin pump (in trials at the moment)","[removed]","Cool, now I'm Diabetic AND sad. Thanks generic, 'we nearly got the cure maybe...' story. I seriously hate seeing this stuff come up, having been a type 1 diabetic since I can remember, it's just depressing to see this stuff through tired cynical eyes. Sure there may be light at the end of the tunnel but that tunnel is too long for me to reach the end of in my life time. Good luck to the next generation I guess.","So there I am starting my second semester of my first year at U.Va. in 1990.  Start feeling a little sick -- figure it was flu, maybe stomach flu.  Then I start getting severely sick in classes -- vomiting, excessive urination, the works.  \n\nI end up having to stay in my dorm suite because I'm so sick.  After three days of puking in a bucket and losing about 30lbs, I end up calling family and getting taken up to get checked out by a family doctor in the Beltway area.\n\nDiagnosed with, and treated for Type 1 Diabetes.  No history of it in the family.  Totally out of the blue.  \n\nI have had a rather complex theory for 25+ years as to how I may have contributed to its onset. \n\nI was athlete at the time and doing quite a bit of weight-training and weight-gaining. So, I drank a LOT of cow's milk -- gallon, gallon-and-half a day, particularly once I arrived at U.Va. (because of the dining halls and milk dispensers and so forth).  Soy milk wasn't even a thing at conventional grocery stores then; didn't exist at the dining halls either.  And, admittedly, I WAS also drinking alcohol heavily because I had been rushing and it was my first year at University and so forth.  \n\nSo here's my theory:  \n\nThe proteins in milk are supposedly identical to beta cells.  Some of these milk proteins somehow made it in to my circulatory system.  Naturally the immune system responded by killing these milk-protein \"invaders,\" but in doing so, killed ALL similar proteins in the system, i.e. the beta cells of the pancreas.\n\nYou'll ask:  \"But how did they make it in to your system?  That's ridiculous.  What did you do, inject yourself with ...milk?\" \n\nIt's not a popular subject in the medical community, but some speculate that \"leaky gut\" may been a factor.  I was drinking alcohol heavily because it was my first year at University and I was socializing etc., and excessive alcohol-consumption supposedly causes a degree of \"intestinal permeability.\"  \n\nSo, a potentially permeable intestine coupled with perhaps a bit of undigested cow's milk that it allowed in to my system, plus my immune system kicking in to kill it and (ta-dah) I'm suddenly Type 1 Diabetic.\n\nYou'll say:  \"Mmmm...but do you see a lot of little kids or teenagers who are diagnosed Type 1 who have a diet VERY heavy in the liquids you described?  No, but they still get diagnosed with Type 1, right? Average adults?  Pregnant women?   They still get diagnosed Type 1.\"  (Note: Well, I have seen a few children and pregnant women drink a good amount of cow's milk for bone health, and so forth).  \n\nSo, obviously, my theory might be a bit peculiar to me \n\n(Although I have also heard some speculate that, in addition to alcohol, certain medications and treatments can also lead to a degree of intestinal permeability.  Just a bit of undigested cow's milk makes it through in to one's system AND...   But, just a theory.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","Interesting, I was just dx'd t1 at the age of 28 and I was huge into milk and alcohol.

And false readings aren't too uncommon.","[deleted]","It's a start, you can't go from initial research to system that fixes all your problems overnight, it takes time. The next step as I see it will be an implantable meter, that will provide better accuracy that an external meter will.\n\nYou'll still probably have to do blood tests for the forseeable future but compare this system on a kid to just a pump, kid wouldn't need to interact with the pump at all or be taught what to bolus (if they get it wrong, outlook not so good), their parent can check and control the meter remotely.","Can you give us any links you might have? For those who have never delved into this. Thanks.","Thank you for taking the time to post that. \n\nIs this why some research is referring to Alzheimer’s as Type 3 Diabetes?

I have been actively searching for studies to get into for UC but there just aren't any to participate in.

Maybe I can get in on the US testing later this year.","Ankylosing Spondylitis here. No cure, degenerative spine and joint problems, immune system deficiencies. Right now the best anyone can offer is ibuprofen and physio, with spinal surgery a last resort to reverse the fusion of vertebrae. Some people use TNF-α inhibitor for chronic cases, and it's remarkably effective, but they're all based on artificial antibodies and the side-effects can be horrendous (e.g. lupus, catching hepatitis or TB, etc.) to the point where they're not worth the risk for most sufferers.\n\nThere's been a massive uptick in research into the disease and its treatments over the last decade and it makes me really hopeful for more effective management and a reduction in symptom progression by the time I approach retirement age, which is when it's likely to do me the most good.","Yeah those side effects are not worth it.

I (and presumably others, then) have never run across the term orphan-designated product.","Yea, sorry I was at work. So an orphan drug is a drug that is designed or researched for an \"orphan illness or orphan disease\" which basically just means a disease that is not very prevalent (many immune disorders) OR a disease that is prevalent but the industry has been ignoring due to financial disincentive (ex. malaria - b/c most victims are in Africa and drug companies don't make much selling or giving meds to these areas). \n\nBUT the ODA (orphan drug act) actually covers some straight up research for these illnesses, not just drug research.

My last one was 9.6. It's very frustrating.\n\nHere in Canada the gov't pays for nothing. I have very limited private coverage so I pay about $300 per month.

I'd love to have a pump but that seems to be pie in the sky and heaven forbid if I lose my job. No idea what I'd do then.\n\nI must say though that I have a wonderful pharmacist who will give me a month of my slow insulin when he has a card to use. He does more to help me than the Gov't health plan or private insurance. Bless him.\n\nIt is was it is though. Sorry for the rant. Rant over!","If your a1c levels are still high obviously you aren't watching what you eat carefully.\n\nMy ex's dad was like you. Thought he ate healthy ran and was no where near over weight but he developed type 2 anyways. He was always eating fresh fruits, smoothies, while wheat pastas, etc.\n\nI had to sit him down and show him how many grams of carbs he was eating a day. Even if they were healthy. Eventually heist used his diet to manage it but it took a while.\n\nStrangely enough when my ex moved with me from Alberta to Ontario she developed type 1 diabetes and her family was convinced it was the same as her dad's in that it could be fixed with diet and that she didn't need shots 3 times a day. She spent 3 days in the hospital with blood sugar levels of 50+. They sent the blood to 3 different hospitals to confirm (Trenton Belleville Kingston). No diets going to fix that in a quick amount of time ","Oh god, my mom is a t1d and she eats lots of fruit.  She won't listen to me about carbs. She says \"the nutritionist says I should eat fruit/beans/oatmeal because they're whole foods/\"good\" carbs!\"  I've tried to explain it to her, but she likes fruit and that's what she wants to hear.  Can't convince her otherwise. She is thin now, but had been chubby in the past. ","Have you ever been tested to confirm you don't actually have Type 1? It is estimated that 1 in 10 Type 2 patients are actually misdiagnosed Type 1, and that if you take all the overweight people out of that equation the amount of misdiagnosed is 1 in 2. So out of all people with Type2 who maintain a healthy weight, approx half of them are actually suffering autoimmune diabetes. My SO was one of the misdiagnosed. Diagnosed at 28 with Type 2 and a very fast decline into multiple complications before antibody testing discovered he actually has Type 1.5 or Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults. He now has, along with diabetes, retinopathy including being legally blind in one eye, kidney failure, heart disease, peripheral neuropathy, gastroparesis and hypertension.

Is it not possible that children who have a parent who has type1 could not later develop diabetic symptoms in the form of type2. Are we certain type2 is caused by eating so much sugar or carbs and getting so fat our bodies stop producing insulin or absorbing it or did the chicken come before the egg? \n\nI believe it is possible that type2 could be genetic in some circumstances if not all. I think this way because obesity could be due to the failure of regulatory t-cells performing properly. Your body is meant to regulate your body weight. What would occur that would lead a person to ingest so many calories over a length of time to get this way and overide millions of years of evolution? I think something bigger is happening here and it is being ignored. \n\n","I had no idea that was the case, but now I want that answer as well.","[deleted]","The exaggeration is most often due to media setting the headlines. You can bet that the original publication isn't named with anything containing \"a complete picture\" or \"final piece of puzzle solved\".\n\nConsidering that there are many antigens involved in the autoimmune reactivity that causes the destruction of the insulin-producing cells, I'd also say that this study will be of relevance to some patients, although not all. Not everybody with diabetes will have autoreactivity against all the antigens that have been identified to associate with type I diabetes. I think that diabetes, just like in cancer, is moving towards more personalized medicine where it's important to distinguish between type I diabetes and type I diabetes, at least if we're trying to target the disease before it breaks out rather than fix the symptoms afterwards. Person A with diabetes I will have the same symptoms, but not the identical causes in terms of what antigen they're getting the auto-reaction against as Person B with diabetes I. For that reason, I think it's pretty important with studies like these even if they do not target the full repetoire of potential antigens in diabetes and even if they will not help everybody with type I diabetes. And even if this turns out to not fully cure/prevent the disease because it doesn't target the complete immunoprocess, it's possible that by intervening with part of the auto-reactivity- although you cannot block it completely- you'll manage to delay the destructio process and keep a decent part of the insulin production longer.","I am shocked that our own immune system which we thought was the one who fight back to intruders inside our body was also the one who attacks and destroys our own cells in the pancreas.","I remember there is a recent breakthrough where new beta cells were grown from stem cells, potentially allowing a cure for Type 1 diabetes, though the problem of immune cells attacking the beta cells in the first place could still be a problem.","&gt;Edit: I see a lot of people lamenting how breakthrough research never lives up to the hype. I look at it like this: If Reddit was around in the 1920's there would have been a post, Canadian researcher isolate small peptide from pancreas of dogs; use it to cure diabetes.\n\nIt's also worth noting that research doesn't have to 100% cure something to be useful and effective towards treatment. ","If anything this article might help educate people.  I have been doing emergency medicine for 12 years.  I was a medic in the military.  I worked for a hospital ER for 2.\n\nAnd, not until a friend got diabetes 5 years ago did I know that you could get type 1 diabetes at 30 years old.  He got it from some unknown auto immune disease that attacked his pancreas.  He didn't even know he had it until he started having trouble seeing and went to an optometrist. ","Thanks for clearing this up both for me and others there is a lot of confusion in the public in general about type one diabetes . The media really don't seem to understand and it all just makes it worse.\n\n\nThere has been a number of breakthroughs recently I follow a few but never get my hopes up. 15 years ago when I was diagnosed I was told that within 10 years we would have something.

The everyday water you see contains dissolved minerals and often suspended materials. But, for practical purposes, if you fill a glass from your faucet the water will look colorless to you. The water is in fact not colorless; even pure water is not colorless, but has a slight blue tint to it, best seen when looking through a long column of water. The blueness in water is not caused by the scattering of light, which is responsible for the sky being blue. Rather, water blueness comes from the water molecules absorbing the red end of the spectrum of visible light. To be even more detailed, the absorption of light in water is due to the way the atoms vibrate and absorb different wavelengths of light.

She told Belgium I told you so the day of the attacks, she has no remorse for anything she has ever done wrong like attacking her husbands alleged rape victims or all the racist things she said in past while running against Obama.

My grandmother was a Clinton supporter for two things. Her name, and the fact that she was a woman*. It took a few weeks but now she likes Sanders after hearing both of their views. Sadly, this isn't in the US but just saying that people can be won over. ","I think name recognition is the best explanation for Hillary and Donald's success. ","Hillary's \"name recognition\" comes from 25 + years of public service. \n\nSecretary of State of the United States of America. \n8 years as senator of the State of New York.\n8 years as First Lady of the United States.\n13 years as First Lady of the state of Arkansas.\n\n\"Name recognition\" \n\n","It's mostly being first lady of the U.S. and then running for the dem nomination in 2008. You can have 30+ years of public service as a senator and not have name recognition because only a few politicians are known by the majority of citizens. Most people can't name a single Congressman or Senator from a state other than their own. And they probably can't even name all of the ones from their own state. Same goes for Governors and Mayors.","It actually came from being the first lady involved in a huge scandal...","Or an extreamly public fight for universal health care. Or her very public denouncing of human rights abuses while visiting China..\n\n","All that needs is \"A lifetime of crime and corruption, priceless\" at the end ","How is voting within the system a revolution? ","A revolution doesn't have to be a violent overthrow of a system from the outside. A revolution can come from the inside of a system, and be peaceful at the same time, without losing any of its legitimacy. All that's required is a radical shift in how the system operates.\n\nNow, I would argue that Bernie isn't honestly all that radical. Most of his ideas are just good, common sense, politically and economically, but the fact that he's gaining so much traction when America has been opposed to these ideas for so long is what makes this a revolution (albeit a very peaceful one, which I consider a wonderful thing).","indeed. in most other countries, bernie doesn't qualify as a radical at all. it's just our political system is so corrupt that having anybody who speaks about actual reality at all in the public sphere is revolutionary.","I don't think we even know what a revolution is. It's been a buzzword in our society for so long that it's lost any intrinsic meaning somewhere in the mid-90s during an ad campaign for children's toys or something. Even if a revolution could happen through a broken voting process, I'm not sure it can come from the presidential seat. Everyone seems to have forgotten the job description of the president of the United States of America and it is frustrating. They are the head of the armed forces. They can pardon people. They can appoint ambassadors and judges to the Supreme Court. Nowhere does it say they can pass laws to stimulate a revolution. Even with the questionable executive order functions of the president, I don't see anything major changing socially. Sure I would love to see real true positive change that I don't have to exchange my freedoms for...but this situation is almost identical to Obama and we all know that hope and change can't make a revolutionary paradigm shift occur. ","It's still no revolution. Even a peaceful one would need to overthrow the political system to be called a revolution.","Well, for 1) Any other kind of revolution would be a federal crime and 2) How else are we going to achieve change? Go ask the pure anarchists how well not partaking in the system is getting the fall of government or sinn Fein refusing to be in parliament is helping out that northern irish cause. \n\n","The RNC prefers HRC over Trump. Now the Koch brothers are expressing interest in her candidacy as per the ABC interview this morning. Potential voters need to know this.\n\n","Why are so many comments removed?

COINTELPRO works better when its hidden. Its kind of funny, actually.","[removed]","I have a bunch of homework to do and finals to study for. BUT I WILL BE PHONEBANKING TODAY! JOIN ME!","yaaaaay! :D","How are we going to fight of the Hillary Bot Army? They are coming into full effect now. We're trying to spread our message, but they're on every corner we go.","Serious question, does Bernie even have a legit shot of winning the nomination at this point?"," Are his chances slim? yes but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a chance. There are still a lot of possibilities for him to win the nomination. Assuming there's not voter suppression and fraud in the up coming states (which there will be) he would mostly win all the big states. Now assuming he loses those states based off the voter fraud that has been going on, Bernie can still take it all the way to the convention and try to convince superdelegates that he is better at beating Trump in the general than Hillary, since Hillary only appeals to old loyal democrats, and Bernie appeals to all other demographics, which greatly out numbers the old loyal democrats. As of right now, Hillary doesn't appeal to anything else, and isn't trying to appeal to the demographics that support Bernie, she kind of just expects them to vote for her without doing anything to win them over. But I can tell you that a big % of Bernie supporters hate Hillary, and will not vote for her no matter what. If the superdelegates look at the facts, then turning to Bernie would be the only way to prevent a republican from taking the white house. \n\n\nThere's also the possibility that Hillary will be indicted. Again, if the superdelegates are smart, they would not put all their eggs in the Hillary basket, because if she gets indicted if she is the nominee, that's like handing over Trump the keys to the white house. \n\n\nNow in order for Bernie to appeal to the superdelegates, he may not have to necessarily win most of these states going forward, but he does have to get as many votes as possible in every state. So the Bernie supporters turning on Bernie, or giving up on him are not helping his case if they want him to really be the nominee. \n\n\n","lol u/fedart","Yeah","Likely? No. Legit?

It's just two different alloys.

The conventional way is to cut the stock 3/4 of the way through, fold it back on itself and faggot weld an inch of it to form the point. Some claimed that this wasn't the strongest way of welding and advocated for a scarfed weld.\n\nSomeone did some testing with a 12mm faggot welded poker and was able to hang 400lb's worth of anvil from the welded hook with no sign of failiure. The exact same discussion was had, that technically the scarfed weld would be stronger, but it's a goddamn fire poker!

If you leave a blade mostly hard, it will take a finer edge and take much longer to get dull, but it also leaves it brittle. If you temper it at a higher temperature you make the steel softer, but tougher. Kitchen knives are usually incredibly hard for their size (especially high end Japanese style) because it gives much better performance for it's intended use, while cleavers and camp knives are expected to endure shock loads and are tempered softer.

The pattern you see is how the two dissimilar steels join up... how they're distributed.  You can see it very faintly without the etching, but it doesn't show up well on camera.  There are many different patterns of damascus you can make.  Modern damascus is forge welded steel.  The old kind is something else entirely -- it's a bit confusing.  The last example here will show the original stuff.\n\n\nThe modern stuff is made by taking two steels, folding them over and over again, and forge welding it all together... reall high temps, more than regular forging temps.

To the layman, probably not a noticeable difference, but a difference none the less. This also varies depending on which steels are forge welded to create the Damascus.","deadly poison increases your attack by 2, so its stronger","The acid wont do anything unless its undiluted and the blade sits there for weeks.  The only thing its doing is causing an oxidation barrier on the higher carbon steels mqking them darker but not on the higher nickle content steels.  How ever damascus or pattern welded steel has a single flaw which is very serious. It's called delamination.  This occurs when the steel isnt welded properly and the layers start to come undone. ","The acid shouldn't weaken the blade any.  Consider it a surface deep chemical attack on the steel.  You can usually remove an acid etch with a quick buff of the surface.  In industry, this is commonly called acid etching.  We use it all the time to pull out visual representations of weld joint macro and micro structures for examination.  It's incredibly useful for repairs as well.  ","If the steel is forged and folded like the layers are revealed, it should have a better structure, but it depends how the forging was cooled and how many layers, that were folded.\n\nBut I think this more of an aesthetic thing, when buying knives.\n\n","Nowadays Damascus steel isn't really that special, but in medieval times it was arguably the best steel in the world (arguably as it's likely the Japanese Katana was superior but there's no recorded instance of them meeting).  To give you an idea, when someone wielding a Damascus blade came up against your average English Knight, it wasn't all that uncommon for the knights blade to straight up be cut in half by the Damascus one.  ","&gt; To give you an idea, when someone wielding a Damascus blade came up against your average English Knight, it wasn't all that uncommon for the knights blade to straight up be cut in half by the Damascus one.\n\nI'm gonna call bullshit on that, unless you can give me a source. Also, Japanese steel was not better. As /u/HuffsGOldStars said, it was folded so many times because the materials were not as good as western steel. This is why western blacksmiths don't have the same tradition of folding steel, because they did not need it.","You are correct on all counts.\n\nAlso,  I'm going to point out something  (and, really this bothers the shit out of me). What we call \"Damascus\" steel today ***ISN'T*** really true Damascus steel. It's forged like it, but the actual formula for the base steel is still unknown.  It seems to me, that there's an additive that we're missing.  \n\nNo shit, I honestly think it's something stupid simple that we just overlook because it's so simple and obvious.  Zirconium Oxide comes to mind. Why? Sand. There is a lot of fucking sand in the Middle East.  I believe that it is possible that a bit of sand worked its way into some of the ore as they smelted it and wound up folding the steel as a means to make up for it and even things out a bit, only to stumble upon something better than what they had before.  That would explain the nano-tube structure they find on surviving pieces.\n\nWith regards to the accounts from the Crusades pertaining to Damascus Steel being able to cut through lesser metals... Obviously bunk. Exaggerated to make themselves the underdogs. But, it is possible that it was strong enough to bite into and sharply dent other swords (like, swinging a cheaply made stainless steel sword onto a piece of rebar)","Umm, I think you're conflating a few things. First, you're correct that what we call damascus steel in modern parlance is more technically called pattern welded steel. However they are NOT forged the same in the slightest. Damascus steel traditionally referred to a crucible cast steel from India with an extremely high carbon content that was cast, allowed to slowly cool, then forged at a very low heat so as not to dissolve the carbide structures that formed in the steel upon initially cooling. Pattern welded steel on the other hand is simply two or more pieces of steel that are welded together and formed to shape, the Japanese did this to even out carbon content in their extremely poor iron ore and the Vikings did it to show off their craftsmanship. Now on to the properties of damascus, damascus (also known as wootz) was the absolute cutting edge of steel technology *for the time* and really only for small knives. When compared to any modern steel it is completely outstripped in every way, true damascus is extremely soft, doesn't take a very acute edge, and is fairly useless for anything but a small knife. Also, people tend to mystify true damascus as some sort of ancient lost hocus-pocus when in fact it was rediscovered how to make it way back in the 80's! If you have a furnace at home (easy to make) you can even make it yourself. And as for the \"carbon nano-tubes\" part? Yeah, any time you get graphite you're going to have carbon nano-tubes, bucky balls, and other similar structures form randomly, but this also happens in cast iron and for some reason no one ever suggests that would make a good weapon... Carbon nano-tubes are even found in soot from your fireplace, it's seriously EVERYWHERE, but it makes a good headliner and gets spread about much like the myths about katanas. Anyways, this turned into a book but I hope it helped clear some things up for you! ","I'd read that the whole reason that Japanese swordsmiths folded the steel so much was because the quality of Japanese iron ore was shit. They didn't have to fold it so much elsewhere because the iron in those places was much better.","now sell it on steam","It's a stattracker!","Surprisingly, some of the CSGO knives are worth more than their real life counterparts.","Most have been for ages.","how is that surprising? knives aren't rare in real life","same with cs:go, everyone has 2 knives","I see what you did there.

The recipe for true, traditional, real Damascus steel has been lost to time, for lack of a better description.","It still is. This is called Damascus steel because of the pattern","We know a lot about what the steel is made of. But to date, nobody has been able to replicate the forging methods to recreate the pattern you see in Damascus steel artifacts. They may have used folding, but true Damascus blades are not pattern welded. The patterns are actually a result of the way the trace elements interacted with carbon throughout the forging process. \n\nSomething similar can be achieved through pattern welding (though it isn't quite as impressive looking, imo), but anything you see today that is advertised as \"Damascus\" is really Damascus-patterned. Not true Damascus steel.\n\nThat doesn't mean modern pattern welded blades don't take an impressive amount of time and skill to produce. They do. And the one in this post is absolutely amazing looking. But labeling it \"Damascus\" is a bit misleading.","Not really, people make it out to be far more mysterious than it really is! Pattern welding or crucible steel almost certainly cover how it was made, we just can't categorically prove it.","We can make pretty a near copy of what it was. We just don't know how they did it. ","Ferric Chloride can also be used to etch copper plates in printmaking. Fun fact: it's not actually an acid but it gets the job done.","Further fun: FeCl3 may not be a Brønsted acid but it is a Lewis acid, and it forms hydronium when made into an aqueous solution, so... it is an acid. ","Did not know that, but now I do !!!","and for making circuit boards","What's the enchantment on that?","Time for some clarifications on misconceptions, because this is not *real* Damascus steel.\n\nThe steel you see above if pattern welded steel, it comes from a process where multiple layers of steel are welded together, then forged to produce a pattern affect that resembles Damasacus steel. \n\nThe process of making *real* Damascus steel (also known as wootz steel) has been lost to us. We can scan old Damascus steel blades to determine their chemical composition (learning what had been used to originally), but we can't figure out how it was smelted in production. \n\nWhen steel cools its molecules align in specific ways that allow it to have different properties; very fast cooling will leave the steel very hard but also very brittle, very slow cooling leaves the steel less hard but also less brittle. In sword fights you didn't want your sword to shatter in battle so this second type was preferred.\n\nDamascus steel seemed to defy those rules though, it was both very hard and flexible; which is why it was very popular and well known. And whatever process that was used to create it left an odd wavy pattern on it. We still have no idea how Damascus steel was made, but we keep finding new properties about it like carbon nanotubes inside the steel's cdystal steuctures.\n\nModern pattern welded steel resembles Damasacus steel, so people have taken to calling it that; but because pattern welded steel isn't a singular piece of steel this modern replica isn't as strong as a singular piece od similar steel would be. So it's very much the opposite of the steel it's ancestral name derivates from, but because people still associate the name Damascus with quality these blades can be sold with a large price increase.\n\nIf you're interested in how steel gets different qualities based on the environment it was formed in, or had any other questions feel free to pm me. I'm a chemical engineer who has been researching this subject with my free time, in the hope to one day bring the real Damascus steel back to this world.","You should probably learn some metallurgy first before you go about reinventing the wheel. You're talking out your ass if you're claiming pearlite makes a superior blade to properly tempered martensite. Also, do a little more research on wootz maybe? It should only take a couple seconds to find out it has already been successfully remade.  \n  \nhttp://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/9809/Verhoeven-9809.html","Maybe you should read the article you link (because I have read it). They believe that they can recreate Damascus sttel ignots, but the ignots they create all suffer from the same flaw, they can't be forged into blades by blacksmiths.\n\nSome would believe that this indicates that we've lost the forging process, but I find it much more likely that the process of creating the ignots, discussed in this article is not the original way Damascus was made.","That's not what that said at all, and if you look the article disproves you since they actually did forge a blade as part of the experiment. The damascus steel is hot short, which means forging it at usual forging temperatures causes it to crumble. This matches the accounts of smiths in France/England who bought raw ingots and attempted to make their own knives out of it. Hot shortness is simply a function of the high carbon content and is similar to cast iron in that regards. The paper outlined two different methods of forging the ingots.  \n\n1. Get the ingot well above usual forging temperatures, let a thick decarburized skin form on it, and forge to shape. Then normalize the blank multiple times to reintroduce the carbide banding.  \n\n2. Forge the ingot at a dull red heat, this is probably the way it was actually done. Damascus steel iron ore naturally contained high levels of phosphorus which contributes to ductility at low heat.  \n  \nIf you actually are a chemical engineer your lack of reading comprehension is scary to say the least. ","[Relevant] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Blacksmith/comments/16t49n/z/c7z6ih9)\n\nOne of my favorite posts ever on Reddit.","So many bandaids","how much on cs:go?","After watching a couple seasons of that forged in fire show I can't stand damascus.  90% of the time the weapons made from it fail, it might be because people are trying to replace skill with a flashy metal or whatever.  But based on that show demascus is shit compared to just normal modern quality steel. ","I guess gloves aren't a consideration when working with sharp knives or acid etchers?","Safety third, or maybe fourth.","Knife makers don't tend to wear gloves as they are very dangerous around any kind of rotary tool, which is what 90% of the work is done on.","Yeah but this isn't a rotary tool, it's a container full of caustic chemicals. There's no reason not to wear gloves in this situation. ","Ferric chloride isn't all that bad to get on your hands, it can cause some irritation, but for the most part you'll be fine, don't try to wash your hands in it though, it'll stain just about anything it touches and it's notoriously hard to clean off.","The band aids from the previous incidents are all the protection he needs","I don't really like that it's called Damascus steel.

","What else can you dip in there and get that kind of pattern? Or any pattern.","So, OK: someone tell me why this is 'welding' and not 'forging'.","Pattern welding is a forge welding process, so the production of the billet is usually done in a forge. Many knife makers simply buy a billet and grind it back (stock removal) and never forge it. Forging involves forming steel by moving it, normally with a hammer, stock removal involves removing material to shape it.","it's kind of both. Welding makes two (or more) pieces of metal into one piece of metal via heat, and forging is reshaping &amp; tempering via heat. This blade started off as multiple pieces of steel, and the forging process welds them together. \n\nThis is a simplification, and I'm not an expert, but the overall concept should be accurate enough. :)","I want a straight razor like this. ","Are those band aids on his fingers?","I want that blade, even before he dipped it.","So that's how you pack-a-punch","So, HCl?

You print out your PCB design onto a t-shirt transfer paper using a laser printer, then you iron that t-shirt transfer onto a blank copper PCB.

From the pattern which forms here looks more like how the crystal structure would naturally form if it had been cast. It also definitely isn't damascus steel, as this is clearly adit etching, and also the making of damascus steel is considered a lost art.\n\nFrom the wiki link: \n\n&gt;The original method of producing Damascus steel is not known. Modern attempts to duplicate the metal have not been entirely successful due to differences in raw materials and manufacturing techniques.\n\nBoth together would just be overkill, they both have a similar effect.

I just think that something that was a major deal in the old world being rediscovered would be a little more well known, and not be listed as a Lost Art.","Why would it be? There were a couple of articles written in the 80's when it was rediscovered, but bottom line it's a mediocre steel at best. Keep in mind most of the mythical claims about it were just that, mythical. Most of the stories you hear about it originated with the Persian traders who were trying to drive up the price enough to justify carting them across a continent. The modern equivalent, Talonite, absolutely blows it out of the water in every way. ","For multiple reasons. Namely, it's a lost art. A utility that had been the most significant thing in the area. It was more than just weapons. It was farming tools, butcher's knives, and in some cases, even cookware. \n\nKnowing the actual formula is more than just having the ability to recreate it. It's a glimpse into the ancient world. How they got the materials needed to formulate it, how it worked in their economy.  You keep going on about the \"mythical\" properties, but if the real thing was as shit as you say, it wouldn't have been so widely used and for such a long time.","I never said it was shit, *for the time*! You have to remember, most people in Europe didn't have access to good steel, and vanadium (the alloy the ore in India naturally contained) is an extremely good grain refiner, deep hardener, and carbide former. But compared to any modern tool steel of the last 100 years? Yeah it's shit. You are underestimating just how much the Bessemer Process and it's ability to precisely control alloy content in the 1850's changed steel technology. Before Bessemer your choice was either cast iron, or wrought iron unless you wanted to pay out the nose or buy from the Swiss (their iron ore had EXTREMELY low sulfur and phosphorus content) but afterwards you could turn out literally tons of steel at a time with exacting alloy contents and no contaminants. Also, could you link these bowls and utensils? I've only really heard it used for knives, swords, and a couple pieces of armor for very rich people. ","Also, Damascus steel wasn't produced in the middle east, it was produced in India. Europeans called it Damascus steel because it came up the Damascus trading road. ","Nova did an episode on Damascus blades a while back which is where i heard this statistic.  I'll see if I can track it down.  Basically the long and short of it is Damascus blades where made, surprise surprise, in Damascus.  There was a period of a few hundred years where Damascus was putting out Damascus steel blades and then suddenly the secret was lost and no one knew why.  It was eventually discovered (eventually meaning relatively recent, 10-15 years iirc) that the secret was iron containing trace amounts of... some element i can't remember off the top of my head.  Anyway, there was a mine near Damascus where all the iron contained some of the stuff, and that's how Damascus Steel was first forged in the first place.  The reason the secret was lost was the mine went dry.  Anyway, this extra element made the swords super strong.  Nowadays we have a better understanding of the actual chemical composition of steel and exactly what elements it takes to make it stronger, but back then they were just tossing charcol and iron into a furnace and hoping.  They could hold a finer edge than British blades, and Damascus Steel blades were famed for \"being able to cut a silk scarf in half as it fell to the ground\" which was not something western blades could do.  All that said, what we know as Damascus Steel today, still isn't exactly the same so it's likely there's some additive we're missing.  Comparison with genuine Damascus Blades to todays modern versions see a noticeable drop in quality compared to the old ones.\n\nYou're misunderstanding.  Yes the quality of the initial steel was terrible.  But the resulting blade could hold an edge far finer than anything westerners could come up with.  Good British blades could cut a man in half with a single swing.  Katana's however were actually measured buy how much they could cut, and merely cutting through one body would be a terrible sword.  The japanese sword testers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tameshigiri) would cut through straw, cadavers (fake bodies basically), or even convicted criminals in order to test out the swords.  A sword worth buying would need to be able to cut through at least 3 people, and the really good ones were upwards of 5.","&gt; Nowadays Damascus steel isn't really that special, but in medieval times it was arguably the best steel in the world\n\nYou comparing entirely two different things. Damascus Steel today is a completely different product then what you are historically referring to. Damascus steel hasn't been produced in hundreds of years. The present day \"Damascus Steel\" blades are just stealing the popular name and that is all they have in common. [Source](http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/9809/verhoeven-9809.html) and more info on the blades themselves.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the technique of producing wootz Damascus steel blades is a lost art. The date of the last blades produced with the highest-quality damascene patterns is uncertain, but is probably around 1750; it is unlikely that blades displaying low-quality damascene patterns were produced later than the early 19th century. Debate has persisted in the metallurgy community over the past 200 years as to how these blades were made and why the surface pattern appeared.6-8 Research efforts over the years have claimed the discovery of methods to reproduce wootz Damascus steel blades,9-12 but all of these methods suffer from the same problem—modern bladesmiths have been unable to use the methods to reproduce the blades. \"","I go more into that in my reply to the other guy.","Probably because of copyright issues ","wat","#PROBABLY BECAUSE OF COPYRIGHT ISSUES \n***\n\n##[^^^I ^^^am ^^^a ^^^bot, ^^^and ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^respond ^^^to ^^^myself.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CantHearYouBot/)","different time zones.

Bit of a tangent but a really odd thing with kids is that before they have their own income, or before bank cards could be used as Visas (and so used to pay for things online), they'd have no way to pay for Spotify or other streaming services. (Spotify is free on desktop, but the free mobile version is fairly crippled as you can't play specific songs, only play existing playlists, and there's no Pandora in Canada.)\n\nPoint is, what they'd do is just make playlists on Youtube of their favorite songs. So they'd only want the audio, but would be streaming video the entire time just to listen to music. Our daughter kept hitting her data cap and we couldn't figure out why until we uncovered that genius idea. We asked her why she wasn't just downloading music like we thought everyone had done for the last 10-15 years... turned out she had tried to do it using Russian sites. Instant malware/spyware/viruses that messed up her computer. We then had to block her from trying to download any torrents or illegal file sharing.\n\nShe ended up just using YouTube to rip the audio into new mp3s. End result was the same, but not the most efficient way to just get an mp3. \n\nAt least there was one way that the current generation hadn't surpassed me technologically.

He tried to turn his swimming pool into a saltwater swimming pool since he was throwing it out that year.  \n\nIt destroyed the pump and ate away at the metal on the cheap frame since it was a $400 Walmart pool.  He tried draining the pool but poking a hole in the bottom of the pool to allow it to drain.\n\nHis next door neighbor ended up suing the piss out of him because that water drained in his back yard as well.  Saltwater just ate up his grass and he had to have the entire yard redone.","What would a saltwater pool do? ","In terms of what the guy living there was thinking?  I have no idea at all.\n\nIn terms of what draining salt water on grass and around landscaping, it just kills the soil and everything growing on it.\n\nThe guy who did it was avoiding talking to the police and the neighbor about the situation so the people living there got 3 estimates for damages and took him to small claims court.  \n\nI think he was just overall embarrassed his stupidity did that and didn't want to face them.  He promptly paid them within the 30 days after the case though.","Yeah I'm wondering why put salt water in there, do you bring it from the ocean? \n\nGood to hear he paid it promptly though! Good person with dodgy ideas lol.","No, from what I heard was he used road salt for deicing for some stupid reason.\n\nI guess he just wanted a saltwater pool.","For added fun, you can get into any printers that they have while still on your wifi, either print them a note (once printed for my buddy 'wake up Ted.

Especially since the outcome for the boyfriend was exactly the same either way. ","True, the outcome would be the same. And also true, when the argument is something petty. But when it comes to someone stealing your stuff, and your dad takes the side of the thief, something is amiss. You can't just sweep that under the rug. I think it be would be good to stand up for yourself in that situation not only for your sake, but for the brothers sake as well. For you, it lets people know that you are not a rug. For the brother, it sounds like he doesn't suffer consequences for his actions. Now, to be fair, I am speculating heavily on the family dynamic from a third party source, but if the dynamic is as I described then I think it's better to make sure you're clear with why you're doing things ","Oh this was not the first time his brother stole stuff. He has definitely gotten punished for it several times. It got so bad that his dad put a lock on my boyfriend's door, but not the brother's door. He also had to make sure his window was locked. The only reason he got to the PS3 this time was because it was in the living room for once. His brother does get punished by his dad, he'll be grounded and he's not allowed a smartphone at all, but it doesn't matter when he goes to their mom's house and she doesn't continue the punishment because she thinks he's a perfect angel.

Good shit.\n\n&gt;“What civilization is, is six billion people trying to make themselves happy by standing on each other’s shoulders and kicking each others’ teeth in. It’s not a pleasant situation. And yet, you can stand back and look at this planet and see…that we have the money, the power, the medical understanding, the scientific know how, the love and the community to produce a kind of human paradise. But we are lead by the least among us. The least intelligent, noble, visionary, the least among us. And we do not fight back against the dehumanizing values that are handed down as control icons. This is something…I don’t want to go off on one…it’s a lecture in itself… but culture is NOT your friend. Culture is for other people’s convenience and the convenience of various institutions, churches, companies, tax collection schemes, what have you…it is not your friend. It INSULTS you, it disempowers you…it uses and abuses you. NONE of us are well treated by culture. Yet we glorify the collective potential of the individual, the rights of the individual…but the culture is a perversion. It fetishises objects, it creates consumer mania, it preaches endless forms of false happiness and false understanding in the form of swirly religions and silly cults…it invites people to diminish themselves and dehumanise themselves, by behaving like…machines. Mean processors of means passed down by Hollywood and Madison Avenue…. How do we fight back? I think that by creating art…ART. Man was not put on this planet to toil in the mud. Or the God who put us on the planet to toil in the mud is no God I want to have any part of, it’s some kind of Gnostic demon, some kind of cannabalistic demiurge that should be thoroughly renounced and rejected….by creating art, we maximise our humanity and become much more necessary and incomprehensible to the machines! The whole thing with culture and language is that they tend to become traps. And yet, they can become the platforms for enormous freedom…if you understand what it’s all about - and what it’s all about is YOU! You are the center of the mandala. You are not marginalized in any way. The message that the culture gives us is that we are marginal. It doesn’t matter if you have 100 million dollars Fortune magazine will tell you that so do 10,000 other people on the North American continent! This is part of the democratic legacy, we are constantly told that ‘you’re not special’, ‘special isn’t special’, ‘anyone could do it’. And so then, when you look for guidance, direction, mentorship, we always look towards institutions. ‘Well, I’ll go to the university, the army, someone will give me a larger purpose’ - but it is YOU who is the final arbiter. If you keep yourself as the final arbiter then you will be less susceptible to infection by cultural illusion. Now, it makes you feel bad not to be infected by cultural illusion - because it’s called alienation. The reason that we feel alienated because the culture is infantile, trivial, and stupid. The cost of sanity in this society is a certain level of alienation. I grapple with this as a parent, and you come to this realization. What’ll it be, alienated cynical intellectual, or slackjawed halfwit consumer of the horseshit being handed down from on high?! There’s not much choice there. We all want our children to be well adjusted, it’s just that there’s nothing to be well adjusted TO! In the past 100 years as these super technologies have been developed in the West, data has been arriving about the practices of Aboriginal cultures all over the planet - that they dissolve original culture values through an interaction and symbiosis to local plants, that peturb brain chemistry. In this domain the cultural operating system is wiped clean. Something older, even for these people, more vital, more in touch with the animal soul, replaces the cultural operating system. Something not in touch with geography and history, but something writ in the language of the flesh itself. This is who you really are, this is true nakedness. You are not naked when you take off your clothes, you still wear your religious assumptions, your fears, your prejudices, your illusions, your delusions. When you shed the cultural operating system, you essentially stand naked before the inspection of your own psyche. It’s from that position, outside the cultural operating system, that we can ask real questions about what does it mean to be human, what kind of circumstance are we caught in, and what kind of structures can we put in place to assuage the pain, and accentuate the glory and wonder that lurks waiting for us, in this very narrow slice of time between the birth canal and the yawning grave? We have to return to first premises. I travel around a lot and get that jolting experience frequently, of let’s say, leaving London on a foggy evening and arriving in Johannesburg 14 hours later to a sweltering day in a city of 14 million on the brink of anarchy. I get to change my cultural operating system frequently, and so I notice the relativity of these systems. Some work for some things and some for others. You don’t have to be the victim of your culture - it’s fragile. It can be remade if you wish it to be. It can be wiped out and replaced with something else.”\n&gt;- Terence McKenna","[deleted]","no but i suggest listening to a Mono/Poly album\n\nhes like my favorite producer currently","But WTC 7 totally couldn't be a demolition, right?

It works well, but damn is it big(and probable expensive). ","Idk, I counted about 10 seconds from start of peeling to pieces falling off. That's 6 apples per minute. 360 apples per hour. If you're paying a worker 10 dollars per hour to peel and core and slice 3 apples per minute (extremely optimistic estimate, although im making shit up here) you're paying ~5.5 cents per apple. If the machine costs 750 dollars  and 15 cents per hour to run, it basically pays for itself after 40,000 apples (by my drunk math that I was unable to recount how i arrived at the conclusion to), or 120 hours of use. Of course the amount you're profiting off of the cored and peeled apples affects this too but excluding that I'm fairly confident that my math is wrong. If anyone wants to correct me go ahead, but until then I'm pretty sure this machine is a great investment. Assuming the machine needs a person feeding it apples this starts to fall apart but i'm sure an apple-feeding machine exists for some other purpase already that we can use to complicate this equation even more","Your calculation is wrong. It may take roughly 10-12 seconds to peel a single apple, but the machine is doing 3 apples in parallel. I counted 4 seconds between him putting each apple on(which is where I got 12 sec from, 3*4). That means it can do 15 apples per min, much faster than a person. It is surely cost effective, it is just is big as hell too. ","i mean what kkind of use do you have for an industrial (can we pump more power into it to speed it up? i'm sure you could increase the motor speed and potentially profit per time spent running with a better motor) apple peeling/coring machine where the space it occupies is going to be a limiting concern? im not making this argument from a household perspective, unless someone's mom is trying to peel the next year woht of apples for them in a single night, in which case the space issue is likely a nonfactor again regardless. if i owned a business that needed apples cored and peeled and could sell them faster than my employees could peel them i would definitely be investing in this. who knows","Yah, it would have to be an extreme need. But if the business needed 900 apples peeled an hour, this would do it. I feel like it would take 5-10 workers to do it by hand.  ","Nah, the machine is a gimmick, no kitchen would buy this.  it's largely automated but importantly it still needs a PERSON to load the apples. You're not saving on labour.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj2I3TlqoDY\n\nBack in the good old days I'd use a machine like this to peel my apples.  I'd do a box of apples a day for various deserts but mostly plain pies, cobblers and danishes, with a portion set aside for ice cream or other desert combos. I'm just guessing here, my memory is foggy going back that far, but I think it was about 75 apples a box, and I'd finish that in about 5-7 minutes.  After you're done all that I'd end up with an extra step where i'd go over them with a knife, sometimes rough, sometimes precise, depending on whatever needs were.  that would only take an extra 1-2 minutes.\n\nthat's probably between 7 and 9 apples a minute.  At that rate I couldn't really go more than 10 minutes but it seems about right to my recollection.  The tool I used probably cost about $40, Canadian.  They tend to last if you care for them too.\n\nedit: reviewing that video the person went really really slow and was set up w/ mip all wrong.  I got really good at using it and you kind of settle into a quick rhythm, there's even a little trick kind of when you slide the screw back with the right speed and finesse and the core flies off in the same direction more or less where you set your bin up to collect the peels.  Of course, every now and then you get a ripe bit that just won't co-operate but i bet that kind of thing would muck up the OP's machine too.","how hard would it be to repurpose an existing machine and modify it slightly to be able to load the machines up. If you had 100 of these machines and 3 or 4 people supervising an automated system that would load these apples into a machine (we're assuming that you already have people loading the apples for the machine's human counterpart to begin with) i can easily see the machines being more efficient. How many apples can a \"professional\" corer/peeler do per hour, and with 100% efficiency (no breaks, no slowing down as the day moves on, etc)?\n\n\nAlso, no offense, but i do not believe for a moment that any human is capable of *peeling* and *coring* and *slicing* 75 apples in 5 minutes. That's the most ludicrous thing I've heard in my life. That's beyond steph curry of apples territory. Beyond michael jordan. Even anything close to that. I will personally pay for someone's box of apples three times over if they can show me an unedited video of them coring and peeling and slicing 75 apples of uniform perfect quality and equal slice sizes (8 slices per apple). You can't fucking produce that video. It's fucking inhuman. The guy in the video spent more than 10 seconds peeling the apple alone. You triple that speed and you still barely have 5 seconds to cut and core the apple and start the next one. And you're absolutely sacrificing quality at that point. Show me the videwo","I don't have a video of my regular successes from that long ago, nobody had cameras on their phone like now then.  You don't core the apple, the machine does it.  The guy in the link I posted showed the function, but not the capability. You don't sac quality, the machine cuts it to uniform width!  I might only have to worry about clean slices on the apple-slinky for like 10% that would be used as sides for icecream etc, the rest of it would go inside pies or whatever and could be rough chopped.  You don't wanna believe it, i'm not gonna convince you, sorry. This was also only for 10 minutes sprint, not 8 hours a day like it was a shift.","Its easly 15 apples a min, count the seconds between each apple he puts on. Its about 4 sec. 60/4=15.
