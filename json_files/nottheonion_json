The same power cord that goes to all computers and computer monitors, servers and lots of other things that I'm not thinking of right now. If you were stealing a TV which probably has a power cord that runs into conduit or is tied up in cable ties, you almost certainly are not bother with the cabling.

","It's not a common purchase. Normally, everything comes with the power cord it requires. You would only buy a new one in an exceptional case where you lost a power cord, or a pet chewed one up or something. I bet it's the kind of item that the average store only sells a couple per month at most.\n\nIf you are going to try to pawn off the TV, the potential buyers are going to want to see it working. Sure, you can take your PC power cord and use that with the TV, and then you have a computer you can't use because you pulled the cable.

The probability of this happening within one day is less than 1 10^-10. We are talking here about astronomically low probabilities. \n\nThose murders _are_ related. They _are_ related to the trial activity of the murdered (I do not know of any other common activity of the murdered). Now, most likely, it's not a government conspiracy, most likely, it's related to the differences in the party of the plaintiffs. \n\nDisclaimer. The numbers are based on the presumption that the second murdered is the second in command on the plaintiff side and the probabilities might shift couple of orders of magnitude north, but they will still remain astronomically low.","Exploring your disclaimer, You need the probability someone in flint is related to the on-going troubles.

Lets say 1000 people work at the plant, and in government. The odds two deaths occur at random in people who are involved are (48*1,000/100,000 )*(47*999/100,000).

For adults the danger of heavy metal poisoning is somewhat limited as they tend to be most problematic when incorporated into bone or other developing organs which is why it's so bad for kids who are still developing physically. For adults, especially those who regularly consume alcohol or engage in other forms of self-harm like binge eating, it's questionable how serious the threat is from lead in the water supply. Let's recall that the Romans built entire aqueducts filled with lead pipes. Their annual production of lead peaked at 80,000 tons per year which is significant even by modern standards and they used it directly for water transport. I'm not saying it's okay to have contaminated water in 2016 but I am suggesting we shouldn't get carried away about it being attempted murder to expose people to elevated lead levels in the drinking water. It's a bad thing but calling it attempted murder might be a bit much. ","This percentage 0.0023% is still incorrect. To multiply 2 probabilities you have to make sure they are between 0 and 1 whereas percentages go from 0 to 100%. So you take your .048% divide by 100% to get .00048 out of 1 probability. Now square that and you get 0.00000023 out of 1 probability. Now to go back to percent multiply by 100% and you get the real probability of 2 specific people being murdered in Flint: 0.000023% or about 1 in 4.3 million.","GODDAMN IT THAT'S WHAT I HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE \n\nSorry for yelling.

The original article uses leading to describe the lawsuit and later explains that the lawsuit was \"one of the first ... of 64 lawsuits filed on behalf of 144 children.\" Those have very different implications.\n\nThat said, her case did play \"an important role in determining the future of the more than five dozen other lawsuits that were filed\" because the defendant motioned to transfer that case to the US District Court, but that court ruled the case should remain in state court (and so the other 63 lawsuits would too).\n\nAlso worth noting that \"[The lawyer for Sasha's case] said the case will continue and a representative will be appointed for Bell's child.\"\n\nMy point is before you jump to the obvious conspiratorial conclusion dictated by a somewhat misleading headline on an article without any concrete facts, please at least read the original article and try to get some information about the role she really played. \n\nIt sounds to me like she was just one of the first out of many and that her role was not as a true \"leader.\" It doesn't sound like murdering her would help anybody on the other side gain anything since there are so many other lawsuits anyway.

","I just finished my first board in Eagle and what is this","Oh man... my company has licenses for Allegro, PADS, Altium, and Expedition, and honestly Altium is the most painful to use of the bunch. Allegro is an absolute dream to use once you have the skill scripts set up the way you want them.\n\nAny time we have 200+ hour designs to do, we pretty much do all of the routing in Allegro and translate it to whatever software the customer wants.","Allegro is definitely the best of there. Now if only Cadence would make the user interface work better. Or really just eliminate the need for animal sacrifice before starting a board. ","How does Altium compare to EAGLE? Also, how long does it take you to do a board like that? It takes me like 4 hours to just to a simple 4 layer board.\nOh man is that a processing power issue or a software issue? ","Comparing Altium and Eagle is like comparing a BMW 7 series to a Kia Rio. Sure the Kia Rio will get you somewhere, but that's all it's got going for it. Meanwhile, in the BMW 7 series you can sit back and relax as your driver takes you around town and then drive it fast yourself when you need to. \n\nRealistically, Eagle sucks. Altium is a good, easy to use (as far as professional EDA software goes) software that is lacking in a very very very serious manner: no UNIX support.\n\nThat last point is the only major problem with Altium. It's like they want to keep shooting their regenerating foot off. If you go to any major design firm, EVERYTHING is in Linux or a form of UNIX. That means Altium is not even considered for EDA software. Not because it doesn't meat the board design needs of the company, but just because it doesn't run on Linux. \n\nAs for a comparison began Eagle and Altium. There really isn't one. Eagle is a piece of junk EDA suite made popular by people that were intimidated by the more serious low-cost EDA software such as KiCAD and GEDA. Altium on the other hand is best in market in terms of ease of use, customer support, and user reviews. Eagle can do up to 4 layers before it starts to shit itself. Altium goes up to n layers where n is the number of layers just before the board designer rage quits their job and becomes a hermit.\n\nI can't really give a ton of specific differences between the two because the difference is basically the difference between a black hole and a bunny rabbit. Sure you can try to compare them, but it's not really going to be useful. ","Altium has a ton of capabilities that EAGLE doesn't have. Altium is far from perfect, but it can do just about any design. In particular, it has very poor performance with larger designs, regardless of how you're treating the planes / pours.\n\nMy company has a handful of designers, and most of our boards fall in the 30 to 120 hour range, but some of the larger ones can be 400+. A handful of those hours will also be changes requested throughout the design process.","I've seen 30+ layers. The majority end up being ground and power planes. This ensures that not only do the signals on different layers not affect one another but also the power. You end up with layer stack-ups like ground, power, ground, signal, ground, power ect. This isn't always the case but it makes high speed routing much easier.","Top layer\n\nPower plane layer\n\nHorizontal traces layer\n\nVertical traces layer\n\nPower plane layer\n\nHorizontal traces layer \n\nVertical traces layer \n\nEtc. \n\nEtc. \n\nEtc. \n\nPower plane layer\n\nBottom layer \n\nAbove is contained the secret to good signal integrity and exponentially increasing costs.

The instrumentation upgrades were going to cost more than my house.","Back in the days,  we layout graphical design on top layer metal on a vlsi die. If you shine light at certain angle,  you can even see the design.  But then two things happened.  Lawyers,  copyright,  something,  something.  And design rules getting more and more complicated.  Nobody is going to risk a million dollar glorified silk screen (read mask) on the off chance that a sonic the hedgehog's spike is violating an obscure design rule and cause a do over and delay.

MCC was so broken on release that it never got a huge player base, so it's multiplayer now kind of bare. At least when I played it about 5 months ago. 343 doesn't support the game anymore because of Halo 5s release. If you want to enjoy the single player story, its perfect, and it's super cheap now. Halo 5s story is fun, but you'll probably be pretty lost if you haven't played all the other stories.

","After replaying 3 for the first time in a decade I assure you 3 is not as good as you remember and 4 is better than people say.","Oh yeah. I think I agree with you. My main thing is that it takes a couple of playthroughs to fully understand what happened in Halo 3. Halo 4 probably has the easiest plot in Halo to understand. It has a lot of stuff that you won't be familiar with unless you play the games and read the books, but the story is very comprehensible without much of a background. Given that, Halo 3 came out when I was in high school, so it was the perfect timing in my life that I could put a ton of hours into it, and play a lot with my friends, so it remains my favorite.

For example, the spelling of color varies depending on dialect: it's color in General American English and colour in British English. Neither is inherently right overall, correctness only depends on which is being spoken or written. The main reason that AAVE isn't seen as legitimate is because people want to enforce General American English. It'd be absurd to enforce ex-pats in the UK to speak British English, so I don't see why people think the same should apply to AAVE.

Pioneers of the genre include bands such as Possessed, Death, and Morbid Angel.\n\n&gt;This genre often utilizes abrupt changes in tempo, key, and time signature, although this is not present in all forms of this music. Guitars are heavily distorted and down-tuned, and are often played using techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking. Chromatic chord progressions are often featured in Death Metal songs. Death Metal drummers typically play in very fast patterns and often employ double bass drum techniques and the use of blast beats to create a highly aggressive sound.\n\nJust because the genre has a unflattering title doesn't mean the music is anti-peace.","Isn't that just multiplayer? \r\rTo replay the campaign you actually need, well, the story","My college has all their servers named after Greek/Roman gods and demigods.

I thought there was just 2 layers, top and bottom? \n\n","Many years ago, yes, but we've well moved beyond the point where you need more than two layers to route complex circuit boards. So nowadays there are inner layers that you can't directly see from the outside (though they show through the fiberglass layers sometimes).\n\n4-layer boards are very common these days. They usually have one inner layer that is almost entirely ground, and one inner layer that is almost entirely power. This frees you from having to deal with power connections on the outside, so you can use the outer top and bottom layers entirely for signals. As you move up to more complex circuits, you start needing more layers. 6- or 8-layer boards are common whenever there is a larger CPU or System-on-Chip. A typical PC motherboard has 6 to 10 layers. See [this](http://www.gigabyte.com/webpage/16/article_12_ud3_clip_image004.jpg) image from Gigabyte for how one possible layer stackup might look. Different layers can have different copper thicknesses, for different current carrying capability.\n\nLayers are connected with vias, which are little drilled connections that are plated through and make a connection across layers. Vias have also evolved - they used to always go through the entire board (and only connected to the layers that required it), but now we have blind vias, which only go through from one side of the board and stop at given layer, and buried vias, which are entirely contained within the board and connect two (or more) inner layers. You can't see buried vias from the outside.\n\nThe smaller the design, the more layers you need, and the more fancy features are required. The iPhone 4 PCB has 10 layers, the vias are laser-drilled instead of using mechanical drills, and it has blind and buried vias. They need to do this because there is basically no space to route things between components - both sides are packed chock full of parts, so all the routing has to happen on the inside of the board. At that point you're thinking vertically more than horizontally, and the board practically becomes a 3D puzzle.\n\nDesigning complex circuits with fewer layers is an art (and isn't always possible - some chips require a minimum number of layers to route/use, otherwise you just physically can't fit the connections). The more layers you have, and the more fancy features you need (buried/blind vias), the more expensive the board. Consumer products tend to be optimized for lower numbers of layers, to reduce price. Things like servers and networking equipment are less cost sensitive (people *will* pay ridiculous amounts of money for a Cisco), so a lot of the time they just go with massive layer counts as there is no need to optimize, and this lets them have more optimal routing for better signal integrity. The other day I looked at a 10GBit line card for a Cisco ASR router and the board had 22 layers (some boards have the layers numbered on a little guide along the edge, that's how I was able to tell the exact number).","That's just..............WOW! \n\nThanks so much for the explanation, it makes a lot of sense. Are you an electrical engineer by chance? I am studying that at the moment","My degree is in CS, and I'm more of a software/systems engineering guy, but electronics has been a hobby of mine for very long. I don't actually have practical experience routing anything more than a 4-layer board, but I'm always interested in complex systems and the boundary between hardware and software.\n\nIf you're curious about ridiculous layer count boards, you might enjoy [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewz4RAzQTOk) [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHqN6CTOdzA) videos by mikeselectricstuff of an extreme teardown of a SPARC64 CPU module :)","Wow that was awesome. Thanks","As a newly graduated Electrical Engineer who gets to do some board design every once and a while, how and where should I look for jobs that focus more on this skill? I've got some decent experience doing 4 and 6 layer PCB routing using OrCAD, although I've also used Altium in the past back in college a bit. \n\nI'd love to find a job where PCB design is the main focus, but is that a reasonable goal for me, considering I'm just in my first job fresh out of college? ","I'm afraid I'm not really qualified to answer this, as I'm actually in the software field myself (I only did something related to PCB layout professionally once), but what you ask doesn't sound unreasonable. There are many, many companies building hardware who need PCB layout engineers. Pretty much anything that isn't just a rebadged Chinese board, built out of modules, or outsourced, is going to have someone designing the boards. I don't have any specific leads though, sorry.\n\nIf it helps, as an example, I once worked for a small company building irrigation control systems. I wasn't doing PCB layout, but I designed a tool and wrote the firmware/software for it. They had a person specifically doing the schematics/layout, so I actually just sketched out the rough schematic on a piece of paper and handed it to her to make it happen (I could've done the whole thing myself, but they were using Altium which I had no experience with, and it wasn't worth learning it when they already had a person for that). I was only there for a short time, but had I stayed of course I could've gotten more involved with the EDA side of things. There are lots and lots of companies like that, building custom boards for some niche market.\n\nNowadays I'm actually freelancing, and I'm looking forward to getting involved with projects where I can design boards too, but it's probably going to start off with ones that I drive myself as opposed to working directly for clients. Things like building my own tools for the job.","Thanks for your reply. \n\nI'd love to be a board designer for niche stuff. There's just something about PCB routing and placement that allows me to really get in the zone and suddenly it's the end of the day and I feel like I've made progress. Can't ask for anything better than that in a job. But I don't exactly get to design boards all that often. ","I guess part of the issue is that, with smaller companies, you aren't really going to be designing boards all day. You make a product, go through a few test iterations, then it gets released and it's more about the support, firmware, etc. until it's time to make a new product or module. So you probably end up having to do a bit of everything. It's probably only larger companies that end up with people who basically *just* do board design. But if you're also good at things like component sourcing, design for manufacturing, dealing with fabs and vendors, and firmware, that's plenty to make up a full time job. I have a friend who's an excellent board designer who runs a 2-person company doing custom and open hardware and he has lots of stories about how he basically taught himself how to run the entire pipeline, from boards to Chinese vendors to injection moulding to getting books printed.","Yeah, I work in a smaller branch of a company that only has a couple handful of people in the building. I feel as though I'm actually pretty lucky in that regard that I landed my first job out of college in something that gives me a taste of the whole design and testing process. \n\nI'll give you a hint which part I don't like so much: testing and validation. ","Heh, I don't know exactly what kind of validation you mean, but personally I quite enjoy tracking down the odd bug or unexpected behavior. I enjoy reverse engineering, and tracking down weird bugs feels like reverse engineering your own design to see where it isn't doing what you wanted it to do.\n\nFormal validation/testing can be pretty boring, though. I'm more of the guy you call when something unexplainable is happening (more on the software/firmware side, but I also enjoy doing it for hardware), not so much to do formal validation.\n\nIt's good that you got a job that exposes you to more of the whole process though. There's always time to move on to other things as you figure out what is it that you really want to be doing. I had a couple odd/short jobs before finishing college (the one I mentioned above was one of them - got it via a connection to a board member, otherwise it wouldn't have happened), then moved to another country to work for a big multinational (where I'd have loved to find an excuse for a side project involving PCB design, but that didn't happen, though I did find one to work on some low level firmware bringup once), then decided I really wanted to live elsewhere and ended up freelancing. I'm still discovering what path to take but I'm trying to make sure it involves more hardware. I should have something interesting (though probably not money-making) coming up soon writing HDL for a device designed by the aforementioned friend :)","With a EE you're really overqualified to do place-and-route full time. Get something that pays better but still has a component of that. Small shops are the best source of such gigs: you can be jack-of-all-trades. In my area, the avionics places would be where you'd look. YMMV.","Having entire positions dedicated to turning electronic circuits into actual boards is very common in the industry. ","Most companies either have dedicated PCB designers, which is more of a Associates Degree level position, where they do nothing but turn schematics into boards (and maybe do some schematic entry as well), with an EE overseeing the design (choosing a board stackup, layer/route sizes, etc.).   Although when I was an EE, I was contacted as a headhunter that offered a contract position as a PCB designer that would have tripled my pay (as a contractor with no benefits), so it's not an unlucrative career, just you don't have a ton of say in the design, you're just routing what someone else tells you to.\n\nSmaller companies either have the EEs do it themeselves, or outsource the work to a PCB design shop.  But even in those smaller companies, you may be doing PCB design every couple of years as new boards come along, not as a daily task.","I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the routing is automated with a human reviewing and adding a tweak here and there.  Chances are the design rules are pretty straightforward for all but the most exotic signaling, and an algorithm can find a more optimal solution (and maybe even more quickly).","Yeah I figured in companies with more boards being churned out there would be a higher level of automation involved. \n\nI dunno, I guess I'm just trying to figure out what I want out if my job. I'm sure getting a second one in the next year or so will help a lot with that. ","The software to layout boards usually has an 'auto-route' option, but most designers I have talked to say it sucks. It isn't able to take into account vital design considerations like EMI. ","You can absolutely get a job as PCB designer. And it's an artistic task, when dealing with complicated products.","Aaand now I understand the reasoning behind the name \"Viasystem LLC\"","Great post! This is why I tend to like some motherboard makers over others. Some go for extra layers and tend to have much \"cleaner\" designs. I noticed, they not only have more layers, although not anywhere near 22, but also are more picky with the ICs &amp; power SM stuff and place them in a more organized, pleasing fashion. Some board makers, even if server grade, seem to just BLAM, throw it all on top, everywhere, cluttered.  It's not a real issue but I suppose for me aesthetics mean something. ","Yeah, it's not a certainty, but there is definitely a correlation between aesthetics and design quality. Good layout engineers want to be proud of their work. There are electrical implications too; signal lines have to have matched lengths and the like.\n\nLayer-wise though, meeting the design goals with fewer layers is a greater achievement. More layers makes it easier to have more headroom for better signal integrity, but making it with fewer layers might mean the layout engineer had more experience. Of course, ideally you'd have both a good engineer and some budget to spare :)","&gt;Question, what are those \"layers\" and what do they have? I thought there was just 2 layers, top and bottom? \n\n&gt;\n\nFrom a previous post of his in the thread: \n\n&gt;Circuit boards are made of multiple alternating layers of copper and fiberglass. \n\n","I seened this even earlier than that on Facebook of all places. \n\nNot sure where the original image is from.","Nazis could have brought peace, just not the way we would have liked ","Yeah .... But any successful musician knows that that whole world peace thing is bullshit. \n\nWe just want to make a few bucks and provide for our lives ones. ","Low volume *and* cost sensitive presents its own challenges.  My style of embedded computing avoids external memories and parallel buses at all costs.  Almost all of my stuff is done in 2 layers and it'll take me an hour of work to add a single extra trace sometimes.  Using anything in a BGA is out.  Our in-house pick and place system can handle 0.5mm pitch LQFPs on a good day but that's about its limit.\n\nOn the other hand, when the CM screws up a part and every board needs a bit of rework, one person can fix a whole batch in an hour or two.","Holy crap a Reddit repost!!?","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cEdqWZi13I","amen brother","May the music passing through this device please the Machine Spirit residing within.

Eagle filled the niche for a cheap/free EDA tool that could be used for simple designs and wasn't completely useless like some of those random PCB layout tools that came and went.\n\nKiCad is good though, especially as of late. Nowadays there is no reason to use Eagle when you have KiCad.

Forward/back annotation was quite poor, the PCB layout side was pretty sad, making component packages was a PITA (you either made them all manually or used *m4* of all things to create parametric packages). I mean, sure, it worked, but it felt like a cobbled together toolchain without much in the way of user friendliness. Not the \"nice to noobs\" kind of user friendliness, but the \"makes you productive\" kind of user friendliness. The user interface can't really be an afterthought for an *EDA* tool; PCBs are inherently graphical. I remember having to sed my way through project files to fix some component ID mess - text based formats at least make that *possible*, but I shouldn't have had to drop down to that level. At the time I ended up going back to Eagle which, for all its failings, was just more practical.","The problem with gEDA is that it never left the 90s.

This is on the DSI Prophet 5 keyboard.","Eagle is firmly in the hobbyist/maker realm in terms of quality, abilities and support. Issue is that it's bloody overpriced for what it is. The UI seems to have been designed by a summer intern, and the price/quality ratio just isn't there for me to justify paying for a license. If all you're doing is the standard-fare 2-layer run that falls within their free/hobbyist license, sure, go for it. That being said, I personally use KiCAD for my own work and for board designs at my research lab, as it handily beats Eagle in quality and scalability to n-layers, has kickass library management workflows (once you get used to the mindset), and is free/open-source to boot!\n\nAs far as Altium goes, it's a love-hate relationship. The company has done far too much to alienate its corporate users by shoving all their FPGA design suite nonsense down customers' throats, while ignoring their core product (i.e. the PCB/schematic capture tool they are KNOWN for). That being said, they do offer the best value for what they offer in the layout and schematic capture tool, and the last two companies (auto/aerospace) I've worked at for board design/firmware stuff have both used Altium for all internal board design work.\n\n4 hours for a 4-layer board doesn't sound too bad, and it's not necessarily the layer count that dictates complexity. Stuff like impedance control, HVIL, number of BGA devices and PCB antenna design will take up a ton of time, while routing a couple of low-speed single-ended traces isn't exactly rocket science, and can be done by an intern in a few hours. Where things start really getting hairy is mixed-signal and power designs, where you might spend a few hours sitting there and contemplating how exactly to place a polygon pour and via stitches to properly create solid analog and digital ground planes.","Newbie question here: I read that circuit printing was a very expensive process involving massive machines. How do 'maker' level people have a use for EDA software?  Can you submit your chip design to big companies with the requisite hardware and they'll mail you back a chip for your hobby project? ","Getting a chip made its extremely expensive. Getting a printed circuit board (what we're talking about here) made is pretty cheap. ","There are plenty of PCB fab services these days that will gladly do batch jobs on small runs. I got a small switchmode power supply PCB made by OSHPark in a run of 3 boards for only about $12.75 or so. Seeedstudio does runs of 2-layer board for only $1/board in quantities of 10. Either way, fabrication isn't really expensive these days. Also, we aren't talking about chip design here.

They were identified with seven gods (Helios, Selene, Ares, Hermes, Zeus, Aphrodite, and Cronus), but the reason there's seven of them is because that's how many moving things there are in the night sky.  (The other three or four planets are invisible without a telescope.)\n\nThe Greeks also had a 7-day week - thanks to the Babylonians - and they were the ones who first associated each day with one of the planets.  (Originally, each *hour* of the day was associated with a different planet, in order of apparent orbital time around the Earth; if you do that and look at the name of the same hour on seven consecutive days, you get the modern order of weekdays.)\n\nWhen the Romans conquered the Greeks, they assumed the Greek gods were the same as theirs, just with different names. So they attempted a mapping, and came up with Sol, Luna, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. For the planets, those names stuck through into modern English.  But weekday names took a more roundabout path, probably because the Romans didn't adopt the 7-day week right away; they continued to use their 8-day market system.\n\nThanks to Christianity, the 7-day week eventually caught on across Europe, with one of two naming schemes: simple numbering (in the more religious countries, with \"Lord's Day\" and \"Sabbath\" in place of 1 and 7) or the local mapping of the old Greek god-names.  As English is a Germanic language, we inherited the Germanic version of the latter: Ares became Tiw (Norse Tyr), Hermes became Woden (Norse Odin), Zeus became Thor, and Aphrodite became Frige (Norse Frigg).  Cronus kept his Roman guise of Saturn, while the Sun and Moon kept their common-noun-based names.","French is Lundi and moon is lune","Jamaica Day","Ohh!

When you release a physical copy of a document that contains sensitive information it is impossible to guarantee who looks at that document. What if your proffessoror had lost the document, or left it on a desk for unintended eyes?","No, I know. I just thought it was a funny anecdote.","While I'm usually in favor of FOIA requests and transparency in government, there's another side of this that people don't consider. \n\nNo, the Saudis are not our \"allies\" beyond face value, in that they are very good at speaking fairly to us, though ill they mean, to work towards their own benefit. That's what they do best, and it works very well for them.\n\nBut one of the things that having this \"Alliance\" and at least tacitly hiding direct Saudi ties from the public does is that it at least keeps them somewhat willing to only covertly support the islamist groups, reducing their available options, and at least somewhat keeping things disorganized. \n\nIf you make this public, as with a *lot* of the intelligence that is gathered, then you're going to:\n\n1. Galvanize the anti-US parts of the Saudi family and give them ammunition to push to more openly defy and fight against the US.\n2. Galvanize many vocal Islamist groups into backing the anti-US parts of the Saudi family, giving much more power by sheer force of numbers and capability to them, and destabilizing one of the few relatively calm nations in the region. \n3. Give an opening for more fundamental, radical Islamists to seize control in SA, and potentially drive any parts of the Kingdom that do genuinely side with the USA out of positions where they can at least keep the fires to a dull roar. \n\nYes, it's a great coup for the families and for democracy to get the full pile of info and to one-up the government secrecy machine. But in the longer term, the more we expose anyone who even halfway supports an alternative to the fundamentalist Islamists who are very much our enemies, the more power we give to those enemies by virtue of their ability to rally the people to their cause and cause a shift in government. \n\nOne of the absolute worst eventualities we could ever have in the region is if the fundies not only gained control in wider swaths of the region, but if they got enough control with enough powerful people to actually create a unified, well-funded, technologically-advanced state. \n\nThen you wouldn't be fighting \"Terrorism\" as this knee-jerk buzzword used to describe poor, poorly educated brainwashed idiots blowing themselves up and generally being a bush-league rabble for all their ability to coordinate and fight. You would be fighting a state with a much greater ability to raise a real army, with real training and advanced equipment (much of it provided by us to allies in the region). \n\nThen you would be facing a real war with a much, much higher death toll and a much much higher cost than anything we might do in the name of counterterrorism right now. \n\nLooking at this realistically, we can laugh and question the efficacy/necessity of our drone programs and our current half-assed operations because of the absolutely amateur attacks and lack of threat that jihadis pose right now.  \n\nHave them have a chance to solidify and become a single nation with the powers of any of the more 21st-century powers...I don't know that the US has the support, the money, or the will to fight a real, honest-to-goodness war with another nation's organized army. I doubt we'd even be able to react quickly enough or capably enough to prevent something truly horrific from happening.","I agree with the top half, just like many of our actions we are supporting the lesser of two evils at this point. As much as the house of saud sucks, there are worse blocs within it that could use any excuse to upset the royal balance of power in their favor. And even if they failed, we have more than enough evidence around us of the true horror that would be a power vacuum in an oil rich region. \n\nI completely disagree with the second half, we could absolutely wreak havoc on a single organized state with actual violent aims towards us. It's basically our specialty. The rebuilding is where things get tricky.","&gt; it at least keeps them somewhat willing to only covertly support the islamist groups\n\n\"Covertly\" provides them with more oppurtunities to export violence and monarchism to neighboring countries and suppress Arab democracy throughout the region.

And their priority would still be dealing with Iran.\n\n&gt; halfway supports an alternative to the fundamentalist Islamists\n\nFundamentalist Islam is also creation of the monarchy through its state funded mosques, schools, and media. Without continuing to spread ideological education through state funding, it would be extremely hard for the monarchy to remain in power, so they are inextricably linked.\n\n&gt; but if they got enough control with enough powerful people to actually create a unified, well-funded, technologically-advanced state.\n\nThey are getting the money, weapons, technologies, and political power from us already. It's schizophrenic for the US to continue exporting weapons, bombs, censorship\\surveillance tech and continuing to facilitate their foreign interventions. If KSA monarchy is no longer propped up, you would most likely see a shift towards a regime of anti-Iran hardliners emphasizing militaristic \\ nationalist propaganda to justify the introduction of taxes rather than a purely religious outcome.\n\nRelease the pages unredacted and halt weapons exports.\n","The US could easily demolish any non-nuclear nation in a conventional war.

[Here's the full transcript](http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/disinfo/alibis/whitehouse_cheney.html):\n&gt;MR. RUSSERT: What's the most important decision you think he made during the course of the day?\n\n&gt;VICE PRES. CHENEY: **Well, the--I suppose the toughest decision was this question of whether or not we would intercept incoming commercial aircraft.**\n\n&gt;MR. RUSSERT: **And you decided?**\n\n&gt;VICE PRES. CHENEY: **We decided to do it. We'd, in effect, put a flying combat air patrol up over the city; F-16s with an AWACS, which is an airborne radar system, and tanker support so they could stay up a long time. It doesn't do any good to put up a combat air patrol if you don't give them instructions to act, if, in fact, they feel it's appropriate.**\n\n&gt;MR. RUSSERT: **So if the United States government became aware that a hijacked commercial airline was destined for the White House or the Capitol, we would take the plane down?**\n\n&gt;VICE PRES. CHENEY: **Yes. The president made the decision, on my recommendation as well, wholeheartedly conquered in the decision he made, that if the plane would not divert, if they wouldn't pay any attention to instructions to move away from the city, as a last resort, our pilots were authorized to take them out.** Now, people say, you know, that's a horrendous decision to make. Well, it is. You've got an airplane full of American citizens, civilians, captured by hostages, captured by terrorists, headed and are you going to, in fact, shoot it down, obviously, and kill all those Americans on board? And you have to ask yourself, \"If we had had combat air patrol up over New York and we'd had the opportunity to take out the two aircraft that hit the World Trade Center, would we have been justified in doing that?\" I think absolutely we would have. Now, it turned out we did not have to execute on that authorization. But there were some--a few moments when we thought we might, when planes were incoming and we didn't know whether or not they were a problem aircraft until they'd diverted and gone elsewhere and been able to resolve it.\n\n&gt;MR. RUSSERT: And that will be the policy of the United States in the future?\n\n&gt;VICE PRES. CHENEY: Well, the president will, I'm sure, make a decision, if those circumstances arise again. It's a presidential-level decision, and the president made, I think, exactly the right call in this case, to say, \"I wished we'd had combat air patrol up over New York.\"\n\nSo Cheney was pretty clear that he did NOT shoot down that airplane. He merely said that we scrambled jets to fly over DC (which absolutely did happen).","https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7vV3fjfeb9Q \n\nMaybe he misspoke twice then.","Let's say that they shot down the plane and lied about it. So what?\n\nWhat does that change?","I wouldn't blame them for a second it was the right thing to do, sadly. But it changes the truth. ","More importantly, when you watch the entire interview, it's clear that he did NOT shoot down that plane. \n\n[He said he would have given the order to shoot it down had it been necessary.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/feds-would-have-shot-down-pa-jet/)","You got me.

It's a success in terms of getting him to admit to the crime in some degree. But at the same time, it's sad.\" \n\n&gt;The commission's former general counsel, Dan Marcus, now an American University law professor, separately expressed surprise at how little the Justice Department told the commission about Berger and said it was **\"a little unnerving\" to learn from the congressional report exactly what Berger reviewed at the Archives and what he admitted to the FBI -- including that he removed and cut up three copies of a classified memo.**\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/20/AR2007022001344.html\n\n\nYes genius, this all happened so the Clinton administration could cover the Bush administration's ties to Saudi, keep telling yourself that. \n\nOr maybe open your eyes and drop that partisan blindness and realize who is really fucking the American people.","I always went with the Jew conspiracy, but this works too I guess.

Then the dollar will crash, by its own devices, and that'll get pinned on Saudi Arabia as well -- supposedly retaliation for revealing their role in 9/11. That will generate public support for the US to invade Saudi Arabia. That will leave the US military well-staged to invade Syria and Iran, setup the Turkish Stream pipeline, and threaten Russia economically.\n\nIf the Saudi Arabian government makes sufficient reforms, maybe - just maybe - it will be politically feasible for Russia to step in to defend them, as with Syria.\n\n(What worries me is that the whole \"blame Saudi Arabia for 9/11\" thing may actually be a ruse *with the consent of Saudi Arabia* to provide cover for moving massive numbers of US troops and weapons to the staging area. If Saudi Arabia is in on the game, then Russia's only counter-move (as I see it) would be an uninvited, preemptive invasion of Saudi Arabia, making Russia the aggressor and potentially incurring international rebuke -- certainly portrayed as \"Russian aggression\" in the western media anyhow.)\n\nConsider.... what will the Muslim world's reaction be when the Great Satan invades and destroys Mecca, which is in Saudi Arabia?

Previous to this, most people didn't even really grasp how much there was to know, that they weren't being told. At least the needle is moving the right way.","It really isn't. The Obama administration has prosecuted more whistle-blowers than all other administrations combined. Whatever information has come to public attention in the last eight years has been through illegal, unsanctioned leaks, not public policy. \n\nIndividual leaders will push against the establishment in some areas and conform in others. Obama chose early on not to challenge the established military and intelligence interests. Rhetoric aside, it's been business as usual.","&gt; The Obama administration has prosecuted more whistle-blowers than all other administrations combined. \n\nThe question being : how many whistle-blowers were there before the Obama administration ?","Yeah, no idea. I guess maybe they all waited 230 years to start blowing, and Obama was the poor sap who got stuck having to deal with it...\n\nActually I suppose that's kind of true. Most of the things people are pissed off about (smart people, at least) happened before he took office. He's just an establishment guy trying to do his thing, and that means keeping the secrets of the previous decision makers.","President Obama appears to have no personal agenda other than securing his families' position in elite status. He is merely a speech giver and charismatic person. He does the tasks that others tell him from behind closed curtains.\n\nThe general public has no clue.","Would Deep Throat count as a whistle-blower? ","He did help out Agent Mulder quite a bit.","I just saw that episode last night... The truth is out there.","\"Yes, but where Mulder?  Where?\"","I'm not sure how long, but just as an observer it seemed like nobody took the whistle blowing seriously before the Internet boom. Just called them crazy and moved on. What I am 100% sure of, is that the President is a figure head following the same agenda that's been in place since the founding of the Federal Reserve. They aren't for the the people, when they actually might be for the people, they get killed.","Maybe it's just because of the rise of the Internet that this has been more of a concern for governments now. If you want something heard you can release it to the public and the whole world can see it the day it's blown. ","That's a terrible analogy. Before the nineties, there were no \"whistleblowers\" - just traitors. The whistleblowers we do have are more inclined to come forward, because the threats that used to exist to balance the scales, to,give them reason to believe their actions were justified have grown distant and small. So there are more people coming forward, leaking documents and dissenting. And they are able to with less and less brutal repercussions. Yes, there are still reprisals and prosecutions, but it's hardly surprising. \n\nIf Obama *were* to take the steps necessary to safeguard people coming forward, he'd get crucified by senate and congressional intelligence &amp; security committees. He'd be pilloried by the Republicans and it would be used as political propaganda to attack him, and every other Democrat seat. So, of course he doesn't. Whatever he believes, he simply is not able to make those kinds of moves. Just look at how hard it has been for him to shut down Gitmo. He really wanted to do that, but others have blocked him at every turn. The President is not all powerful in the ways some seem to imagine. \n\nThe government is a collection of people, and most of those people are mostly good, because that's how people are. Some might be cynical, or deluded, but a lot of them simply disagree with *you* about how things should be. And maybe they're right, and maybe they aren't. But change of this nature, structural, societal, takes a LONG time, and it has to start somewhere, and it has to be protected and encouraged. It takes decades or more for those kinds of changes to occur, and the one thing that helps nothing is unchecked cynicism. ","\"We don't do the right thing because it's too hard.\" Okay then, pack it up everybody.","First of all, I think you're point is really well made and I agree with most of what you're saying. However, I'm not cynical, and I think it's ok to be dissatisfied with an elected official's actions. \n\nI started off by saying the guy's ability to push against the system was finite. I also said (in a kind of a dopey, reductive way) that his administration is fielding leaks and allegations that have nothing to do with his policy. He really is the sap who happens to be president while this change is going on, and he is very limited in what he can do.\n\nYou're apparently arguing that there is *nothing* more he could do. That's wrong because Liam Neeson has a whole speech at the end of Schindler's List about how even he coulda done a *little* better. I'm not qualified to argue exactly what he could have done differently, but I have every reason to think that the democratization of information wasn't as high up on his list of priorities as I would have liked, and as a voter and tax-payer, I get to complain about it.\n\nSo here's what I don't understand and I think you do: is our new, whistleblowy environment the result of Obama policy, or is it just part of the natural advancement of information technology? Should Obama get credit for some advancement in the democratization of information, or has he just kind of towed the line?\n","Yep. We should definitely be grateful that Obama is feeding us a few measly scraps from the table.\n\nHow benevolent!","Part of the problem is that people like you have the mindset that you somehow deserve everything you want, right now and all up front.

Would you agree here?\n\nI'm not sure how you came to the conclusion that I demand everything I want immediately and on my terms. Or how anything in my post could be construed as complaining. \n\nThe government serves us and it has a duty to be responsive to the needs of its people ( and not the other way around).

Because I don't. I want equality of opportunity, and freedom, not equality of wealth and outcomes. Equality of wealth promotes laziness and stifles innovation.","To an extent, yes, I do.  Wages have been stifled for decades and while the average CEO makes something like 5 times what he did a few decades ago, the average worker makes nearly the same (less, if you account for inflation). Equality of opportunity will not entirely fix the fact that people are working more hours for less money.

The American dream, that anyone who works hard can achieve, is dead for much of the population.

I don't believe that a higher minimum wage (at least not $15 an hour, states and local governments should adjust it based on local cost of living) will create more jobs.

It is probably true that JFK conspiracy theories were fueled and fed by the KGB. But that also doesn't mean that none of them have any merit. Likewise, RT and Sputnik News will be the first to play up revelations about mass surveillance, because it sows discord in the United States and between the U.S. and its allies.\n\nYet, as much as they are keen to do that, that doesn't lessen the veracity or outrageousness of any of those things. Next week, they might do a few segments on chemtrails.\n\nThey don't care.\n\nBy the way, I once ran into a story about how Khrushchev wouldn't stop asking about how JFK was killed, because he truly believed it was a conspiracy. He actually loved Kennedy dearly and the feeling was mutual. I can't find that piece anymore, unfortunately, although not for lack of trying.\n\nAt the same time, certain stakeholders within the American power establishment wish to play up Russian interest and/or meddling surrounding JFK research, because exposing such an association between the two is very convenient in terms of creating distance between the patriotic American public and such research.\n\nThe KGB, if they really wanted this research to take off, should have seen through this ploy and kept their distance. They didn't. Or they thought the benefits outweighed the cost.\n\nI have one reservation about the Mitrokhin Files: they were copied from the Russian archives by hand and the \"authoritative\" book which was released was ghostwritten by the official historian of MI5. \n\nAs such they would have been in a position to insert, distort or withhold anything they so desired. It represents an excellent opportunity for a smear job against political dissidents.\n\nHere is a CIA memo from 1967. I quote an excerpt.\n\n&gt;  PSYCH\n\n&gt; **1. Our Concern. From the day of President Kennedy's assassination on, there has been speculation about the responsibility for his murder.** Although this was stemmed for a time by the Warren Commission report (which appeared at the end of September 1964), various writers have now had time to scan the Commission's published report and documents for new pretexts for questioning, and there has been a new wave of books and articles criticizing the Commission's findings. In most cases the critics have speculated as to the existence of some kind of conspiracy, and often they have implied that the Commission itself was involved. **Presumably as a result of the increasing challenge to the Warren Commission's Report, a public opinion poll recently indicated that 46% of the American public did not think that Oswald acted alone, while more than half of those polled thought that the Commission had left some questions unresolved.** Doubtless polls abroad would show similar, or possibly more adverse, results.\n\n&gt; **2. This trend of opinion is a matter of concern to the U.S. government, including our organization.** The members of the Warren Commission were naturally chosen for their integrity, experience, and prominence. They represented both major parties, and they and their staff were deliberately drawn from all sections of the country. **Just because of the standing of the Commissioners, efforts to impugn their rectitude and wisdom tend to cast doubt on the whole leadership of American society.** Moreover, **there seems to be an increasing tendency to hint that President Johnson himself, as the one person who might be said to have benefited, was in some way responsible for the assassination.** Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American government. Our organization itself is directly involved: among other facts, we contributed information to the investigation. **Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this dispatch is to provide material for countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such claims in other countries. Background information is supplied in a classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments.**\n\n&gt; **3. Action. We do not recommend that discussion of the assassination question be initiated where it is not already taking place. Where discussion is active, however, addressees are requested:**\n\n(...)\n\n&gt; **b. To employ propaganda assets to answer and refute the attacks of the critics.** Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. The unclassified attachments to this guidance should provide useful background material for passage to assets. **Our play should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (i) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in, (ii) politically interested, (iii) financially interested, (iv) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or (v) infatuated with their own theories.** In the course of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful strategy may be to single out Epstein's theory for attack, using the attached Fletcher Knebel article and Spectator piece for background. **(Although Mark Lane's book is much less convincing than Epstein's and comes off badly where contested by knowledgeable critics, it is also much more difficult to answer as a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of unrelated details.)**\n\nhttp://www.namebase.org/foia/jfk01.html\n\nPerhaps I should mention, about the CIA's glowing review of the \"impeccable integrity\" of the Warren Commission as seen above, that LBJ blackmailed a ***crying*** Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren to head the commission and subsequently bragged about it. The same LBJ mentioned in fear in the CIA memo above as speculation about his involvement became more widespread. RFK and Jackie Kennedy both suspected him, too. The reasons behind all this are too complex to get into here.\n\n&gt; **This fascinating conversation between President Johnson and his old mentor Senator Richard Russell is very revealing. Johnson begins by reading to Russell the announcement of the formation of the President's Commission to study the assassination, to which he has named Russell. Not realizing that it's a done deal, Russell complains that he \"couldn't serve on it with Chief Justice Warren--I don't like that man\" and pleads with Johnson to reconsider. LBJ tells him that \"Dick, it's already been announced and you can serve with anybody for the good of America, and this is a question that has a good many more ramifications than on the surface and we've got to take this out of the arena where they're testifying that Khruschev and Castro did this and did that and kicking us into a war that can kill 40 million Americans in an hour.\"**\n\n&gt; **Toward the end of the conversation, Johnson re-invokes the image of 40 million Americans killed in a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union, and then tells Russell how he got Warren to serve on the Commission. After Warren refused several times, Johnson called him to the Oval Office and told him \"what Hoover told me about a little incident in Mexico City,\" whereupon Warren began crying and told Johnson \"well I won't turn you down, I'll just do whatever you say.\"**\n\nhttp://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/lbjlib/phone_calls/Nov_1963/audio/LBJ-Russell_11-29-63_2nd.htm\n","700 Billion in treasuries won't hurt us.

That's like saying a tactic will work against an army because it's been proven effective during games of tag on the playground. ","Except they are trying to stop refugees coming in this way. The situation in Europe is if they catch you sneaking over they send you to Turkey, if you make it over you're fine and can stay. Everything you are talking about costs money for a problem that really isn't that big of a problem.","You don't think twelve million illegal immigrants in a country is a big problem? Even if you don't think the illegals themselves are a problem, surely you can understand why a border that leaks like a sieve needs to be improved.","Agreed.

","So are you claiming that the U.S. government and allies staged 9/11?","There is significant evidence that confidently concludes that the events of 9/11 were primarily a cover up of approximately $240 billion in covert illegal securities used by George Bush Sr. and a cadre of neoconservative accomplices to finance the collapse the Soviet Union back in the nineties.\n\nMost of the details are in the link above.  ","&gt; Atta was reported as having left phone records of call to a company named ‚ÄúVirtual Prototypes.‚Äù VirtualPrototypes (...) It seems as though the type of work done at eNGENUITY was of more interest to the Israeli government\n\nThat's flimsy.\n\nWhy would it cost $240 billion to finance the collapse of the Soviet Union? What exactly would you buy with that, and how would it cause said collapse?","Again, I'd highly recommend reading the study linked above, it goes into depth explaining how and why they brought down the Soviet Union. \n\nIn short, the Bush administration, the CIA, and a cabal of rogue KGB officials built a complex international network of banks and holding companies that would be used to takeover ownership of the Soviet economy.  George Bush authorized Leo Wanta, George Soros, Gerald Corrigan, Alan Greenspan, and others to destabilize the ruble and facilitate the theft of the Soviet/Russian treasury with the help of rogue KGB agents.  The West backed 4 Russian oligarchs and had them takeover the prized Russian and CIS industrial assets in oil, metals and defense. This was done by financing and managing the money-laundering for the Russian oligarchs through the Bank of New York, AEB and Riggs Bank. \n\nThere is way more to the story, but the purpose of the \"economic war\"  launched the collapse the Soviet economy and began the western takeover of it‚Äôs key assets. These operations were assisted by a range of allies of the Bush strategy, and traitors to the Soviet Union.  As the Soviet Union collapsed, they would line their own pockets, and those of their western backers.","But I was told the Soviet Union collapsed because communist/socialist/whateveritwas sucked dragon dick.","And how many people do you think had knowledge of this prior to the attacks?","But this Saudi/Bush combination was long told by Farenheit 9/11, right?","Likely...

You saying, \"My life is good.\" Sure you might be living a good life. in comarison to others. but as the minimum wage increases the price of goods increase. it's a distraction. If Minimum wage was abolished. Corporations would definately get in on that. People could fight that issue by quitting in masses and refusing to work for a corporation until they provide a fair wage. but then corporations would simply hire illegals who are willing to work. The officials made fixing the Economy next to impossible and they're distracting you from that fact.","Look I'm not saying it's perfect here, but I think this is the most ignorant circlejerk on Reddit.\n\n\nSince 2007, i manage several boardwalk stores that employ foreign students every year. I've easily worked with over 100 students from countries like Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Ireland, Macedonia, you name it. Western or Eastern Europe. \n\nNow, nearly everytime these kids come over, they always get so excited as to how much they get paid (starting $9 an hour). Like they want to work 6 to 7 days a week, as many hours as we can possibly provide. Many of them, specifically from Eastern Europe, always say \"I make more than my parents do\" (unless their parents are doctors or dentists). Some work in factories and don't even have stability of work every week. Some of these kids stay in America illegally and send money back home to support their families.\n\nMy point is, people come *here* to work GLOBALLY. They don't go to Germany. They don't go to Denmark. They come here to work their asses off, save money for themselves or their families, and even stay here. Because this country is fucking awesome in wages comparatively. \n\nIs it perfect? No. But I think this site consistently nails it down without considering the global perspective.","America! You have to be from another country to appreciate the benefits!^TM","Ironically, sorta kinda! There's a reason why the world wants to come here to work.","Yep how ironic is that, IMMIGRANTS  tend to do very well here with all the new found possibilities, while we say they're the reason we're unimaginative and have very little motivation...","Well, think about it. If we had lower standards like the immigrants we wouldn't be Americans and we'd have a country like theirs that reflects it.","Except people do go to other countries. Germany for example is #2. \n\nAmerica isn't the best at work-life balance.

So there's that.","lol.\n\nOf course we are-- we were a world superpower with high quality of life and freedoms that made everyone envious of us for nearly 60 years.\n\nWe also have a pretty shitty attitude about work and government and religion so there's that.","I disagree on work attitude. I think working hard and accomplishing things is important. I think if I had lived in Germany, I would have accomplished far less in significantly more time because of the difference in attitudes about work. I take pride in the work I do, and because I am young I am willing to work a lot and accomplish a lot before I end up finally settling down. \n\nAs for government, I think our government is oft-maligned despite doing a very good job. Every government failure seems to be magnified as a failure that should never happen and every success seems to be minimized as something that should have happened a long time ago, when the exact opposite is true for businesses. Failures by small businesses go unnoticed, because no one ever knew they existed, but successes are trumpeted as proof that businesses work better than government. Our government has saved millions of lives through disaster relief efforts abroad, programs like PEPFAR, peacekeeping efforts etc. Our government has given support to the sciences that continue to keep US universities as the best in the world and keep the US as the world's best research hub. Our government has done a lot of good, but sadly people ignore it.\n\nAs for religion, can't disagree.","I'll probably have to maintain my disagreement. After working in the states and then two other countries, I've seen very dedicated and hard-working coworkers, but at the same time there's more caring on the part of the employer.\n\nBoth my previous job and my current one enable me to save lives and do good for our entire world. I am accomplishing a lot of my goals in life but it doesn't come with the same poor attitude. I just can't really see myself working stateside where we don't have statutory maternity leave, paid sick time, mandated vacation, full universal healthcare and a general concern for workers' rights.\n\nI used to work with the federal government, and trust me, there is a lot of great things it does. I am a strong federalist and I believe that we need to do more for our people. It's really hard, honestly, because no country is perfect but we obviously see more flaws manifested in the ones we've lived in our entire lives.\n\nI had a great university education but our k-12 is falling behind in a lot of ways. The more interesting thing to note is that in the western countries I've lived in I haven't seen as much dichotomy in poverty levels and income. I want us to be better but we need to face the facts that we aren't #1 at everything.","Agreed on K-12. Maternity leave, PTO, and vacation days are all taken care of in California and in other states. Worker's rights is vague as hell. The NLRB handles a lot of abuses relatively well. The ACA will eventually get us to 100% coverage as it is a universal compulsory insurance program. Expect to see medicaid expansion in some states and an expansion of subsidies to fill the medicaid gap if Clinton is elected. While I would prefer single-payer, when all of ACA rolls in by 2020, and the provisions that have been rolled out have time to do some work, cost growth will begin to resemble that of Europe, if not be lower due to our high starting point.\n\nK-12 is fucked, admittedly and I really don't know what the solution is.","I'm confused, Germany has a higher minimum wage plus perks like healthcare and education. I know a lot of poor countries have been sold the idea of America (the Phillippines has especially) but that doesn't make it best for them, and immigrants settle everywhere. Yes, people go to Denmark globally too, people move around a lot. Again I'm confused by your comment, it seems ironically circlejerky.","You get a higher minimum because you get a 45% income tax to pay for your education and healthcare. ","I am not going to comment on Germany's tax system as I know nothing about it, but it certainly isn't true in the UK (which is a rich European country and an immigrant hotspot - both from Eastern Europe and from the US and other rich countries).\n\nYou don't even pay any income tax unless you're earning over ¬£11k, and then it's 20% of anything between ¬£11k and ¬£40k, then 40% from ¬£40k to ¬£150k, 45% of anything above that \n\n20% sales tax too. You will definitely be paying to study at a university (whether directly or through the student loan system), same as anyone who lives in the UK except Scotland\n\nIn the US you'd be paying taxes, tuition fees and health insurance premiums, so the gap isn't that big - and at least you don't have to worry about having adequate healthcare coverage in the UK","Sure, on anything earned after $280,000 a year. So that's definitely up in the 1%. I'm not German (btw), but this is pretty basic stuff.","&gt; They don't go to Germany.\n\nUmm, yes they do. Even AMERICANS do.","&gt;Look I'm not saying it's perfect here, but I think this is the most ignorant circlejerk on Reddit.\n\nBut youre saying the same thing?","I think the reason why wages look good here is our low taxes. In all of the other wealthy countries you named, taxes are much higher.\n\nFor example: in the US you make $10 an hour and are taxed 33% of you income. Let's say that in Germany you make $13/hr and are taxed 50% of your income.\n\nWhich one pays better? The US job because $6.66 after taxes is better than $6.50.\n\nI don't think that the US has \"fucking awesome wages\" compared to most other developed countries. I do think that we tax people considerably less which makes it appealing for people who want to work here and send money home.","&gt; My point is, people come here to work GLOBALLY.

Ireland is itself one of the rich European countries of course. No visas needed due to freedom of movement. Plus going home to see their parents is a 1 hour plane ride rather than an 8+ hour expedition.\n\nAnd our minimum wage is more than $9 an hour.","You are overlooking the exchange rate. I dont know to what degree it affects wage comparison but i would bet its a pretty substantial reason why some foreigners go to the US. Especially if the send back most of the money they earn. ","Your examples are poor. If they are making $9 an hour, no wonder they want to work as many days as possible: they don't have a choice. Also, those people can't possibly afford health insurance or college on that kind of money, or buy a house. The cost of college in the US has been going up at several times the rate of inflation for decades. Housing has become incredibly expensive. Health care is incredibly expensive.","Doctors come here from around the world to work here. People want to come because there's so much opportunity in America that isn't there in many countries.

But the solution to fixing the \"problem\" that \"women pay more for health insurance\" required men to offset costs for women as an insurance demographic, including paying for their services in the name of \"equality.\"","&gt;Except ACA mandates destroyed and eliminated many people's plans, so they weren't able to keep them.\n\nMostly because the plans didn't meet the bare minimum of what should be acceptable. ","&gt; bare minimum of what should be acceptable.\n\nI don't have a vagina, which means I can never give birth, so why am I *required* by the ACA to carry maternity coverage on my policy? \n\nThat's one example of a new \"bare minimum\" you can explain for me.  ","Financially it makes no difference for you. The question isn't whether you can give birth, but if your insurance pool is shared by people who can. The entire idea of any type of insurance is to have a large group distribute the costs encountered by a subset, and even more so with health insurance which covers both random catastrophic costs as well as known continuous costs.\n\nIt's the known costs that muddy the water, where some people are guaranteed to come out better than others. In that regard maternity coverage you will never use is no different from any other long term condition your plan covers.","&gt;Financially it makes no difference for you.\n\nNo, my insurance premium (private market) went up dramatically, before I move to an employer-based plan, precisely because it had to meet these new \"minimum\" requirements. \n\nYou can tell a white lie and say \"they've increased for decades,\" but mandates had their most significant impact on young men, according to economists. \n\n&gt;In that regard maternity coverage you will never use is no different from any other long term condition your plan covers.\n\nYou think it's a great thing people are paying for things which, mathematically speaking, have 0% chance of occurring.  \n\nIt's like saying people in Portland, Oregon *must* carry tornado and hurricane insurance because it's unfair to people in the midwest and Florida to pay high insurance costs. \n\nYeah, tornadoes and hurricanes don't happen in west maritime climates anywhere on earth. Climate isn't concerned with \"fairness.\" \n","&gt; No, my insurance premium (private market) went up dramatically, before I move to an employer-based plan, precisely because it had to meet these new \"minimum\" requirements.\n\nYeah. It doesn't matter if you personally have the coverage or not, but you are paying for other people who do. Whether you're covered for something you'll never use is irrelevant.\n\n&gt; You think it's a great thing people are paying for things which, mathematically speaking, have 0% chance of occurring.\n\nDefinitely. I think it's great that people with genetic disorders can pay for treatment they need to stay alive or live a meaningful life. I don't have a genetic disorder, but I know that any system that helps pay for known continuous costs requires there to be losers and winners. Right now, health insurance is that system.","Same reason your taxes pay for public school even if you never have kids. Because a larger pool of resources means better overall care for everyone. [See here](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/healthcare). ","&gt; Because a larger pool \n\nSo your answer to why these new \"bare minimums\" exist is because the government wanted a \"larger pool of resources\"--aka more money to redistribute.\n\nIf you really think the purpose of taxation is to make a big pool of \"do good\" money, maybe target the \"1%\" who were given historically large tax breaks in the 2000s, not ruin the middle class' health insurance and lie about it. (The poor don't pay with Medicaid and subsidies, anyway, by design.)\n\nSecond, don't link to MSNBC if you want to be taken seriously. \n\nMy point stands. The ACA increased rates for certain demographics, which previous weren't paying for a laundry list of \"bare minimum\" services. That's cost-shifting. \n\nNot to mention the ACA is a fucking disaster with high deductibles and  exchanges folding like cards. Health insurance != healthcare. \n\nIf people are too afraid to incur high deductibles of $5000+, then it's really just a rationing mechanism for those not on Medicaid and government subsidies. Another fact Democrats won't say aloud. ","Oh, you're one of those. Nevermind. ","&gt;including paying for their services in the name of \"equality.\"\n\nUm, men don't pay for women's services in the name of \"equality.\" That's just literally how all insurance works: people who don't need to use the insurance pay for people who do need to use it. Healthy people paying for sick people, undamaged car owners paying for damaged car owners. Insurance is a pool of money that we contribute to (our premiums) so that one day we can use if we need it.","&gt;Insurance is a pool of money that we contribute to (our premiums) so that one day we can use if we need it.\n\nWhich is precisely why it should be a not-for-profit thing. ","Agreed. Unfortunately it's not that easy to get rid of for profit companies so they are here to stay. Fortunately the ACA requires that health insurance companies refund any profits above a certain percentage to its members. ([Source](http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article46645845.html))","Yeah, the system is so complicated overall that I'm afraid we'll never be able to swing it over to single-payer, even if the industry DIDN'T put up every roadblock they could think of. ","&gt;  Insurance is a pool of money that we contribute to (our premiums) so that one day we can use if we need it.\n\nExcept health insurance didn't used to charge you for things you cannot biologically use, before ACA mandates. \n\nWomen didn't have prostate cancer calculated in their premiums; and men didn't have maternity coverage calculated in theirs. \n\nThis led to the lie that \"women pay more for health insurance\" when they're simply charged based on risk, which factors in gender and age, like every other kind of insurance. \n\n25-year-old men aren't at-risk for pregnancy, which is an expensive medical episode. ","Are you suggesting that the expense of health insurance plans (premiums vs. coverages) would have gone up to the same degree even if the ACA was not passed? ","I don't know what would have happened, I'm just saying my premiums went up before the ACA and they went up after the ACA.\n\nBut if you want to look at statistics, the post ACA increase have in fact been smaller than the pre ACA increases:\n\n  http://www.factcheck.org/2015/02/slower-premium-growth-under-obama/\n\nThat's not proof that the ACA is the reason for the slowdown in premium growth, but it doesn't make sense to get angry that they went up under Obamacare when they went up less than usual.\n","Private insurance rates shot through the fucking roof after the ACA passed. The market there went from the self-employed to self-employed plus the unhealthy who lost old coverage, so the risk in that segment became pretty obscene for insurers. I'm really glad that I stopped freelancing around the same time. Since most people don't know the actual rates on their group plans thanks to corporate benefits, it makes sense that the sticker shock of that would create the most attention.","That's interesting because I was self-employed before and after the ACA passed, and indeed, the premiums went up, but not by a surprising amount.","\"employer sponsored\"\n\nBTW what happened to deductibles? I tell you what...What happened to insurance companies PROFITS. You might be very interested to learn how the ACA affected those.\n\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2015/01/21/investing/unitedhealth-earnings-obamacare/\n\nhttps://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/01/26/16658/health-insurers-watch-profits-soar-they-dump-small-business-customers\n\nThose profits did not magically come from \"oh well the ACA or insurance companies just got more efficient!\" No...people get less for more money spent. Thats how Insurance companies raise profits.","Not necessarily. Profits can also come from increased float with a larger pool of customers. Ask Warren Buffet.\n\nI can tell from the comments here that people are really excited to jump to conclusions about what happened, with very little actual knowledge. I've got replies telling me that the increase in sick people sucked up the money, and I've got you telling me that there's actually more money. And both have an explanation as to why, even though in reality we don't even agree on the facts and certainly don't have the depth of understanding to draw conclusions even if we did.\n\nIt reminds me of the infamous town-hall meetings before the ACA. I suppose we can add \"health care\" alongside \"abortion\" and \"gun control\" on the list of items that Americans can't discuss rationally. Eventually there will be no more rational discussion of anything that matters, I suppose. But at least everyone can sleep well knowing that they're right and everyone else is wrong.","Or, they could keep their plan, but since the insurance company would never be able to sell that policy to anybody else, the company just scrapped it, so they couldn't keep their plan, but it's on the company, not the government, but everybody blamed the government.","We still have put pre obamacare plan and it's a good one no longer offered.  Think of it like unlimited data plans from 2007.","They could kept their plans, but not necessarily at the same price. My parents health care costs nearly double since the act passed.","How do you figure Republicans are also at fault for the disaster of ObamaCare?  Not one of them voted for it.","Because for 50 times instead of trying to fix it they voted to repeal it knowing full well the president wouldn't sign it and they did not have a veto proof majority. The Republicans didn't look for a solution. They just wasted time pandering to voters that they tried something, when in reality they didn't do anything. ","Republican resistance is exactly how we ended up with the healthcare bill we got.  The end result was vastly different than what was originally being sought.","That's just nonsense. The Dems had a filibuster proof majority in the Senate and a majority in the house and the presidency. It was the blue dogs that killed the public option.

HUh nice perspective you got there.","Cognitive dissonance. ","But that's just the problem: the bill had great parts, like eliminating pre-existing condition limits, lifetime caps, and recision. It also was pretty much the conservative, free-market solution. Just saying it's a shitty bill is too dismissive and exactly what happened in Congress. \n\nThe Republicans fought the bill, but they also failed to produce a real alternative. So, do they deserve any blame? In a way no, since they took no action besides opposition. On the other hand, they're elected to govern and fix problems but were content to leave healthcare broken. Not sure there is a correct answer, but I wouldn't say anyone is completely correct here. ","So because they didn't fix it, they are responsible for its problems? No, the dems got everything they wanted in the bill and any problems is their fault.","I agree that it isn't republicans fault. However democrats had some wildly differing opinions on health care reform so not everyone got everything they wanted.

This isn't to \"protect relations with Saudi Arabia,\" it's a fucking coverup.","It's okay we'll have the last laugh when the Saudi oil fields are all dried up and we're sitting pretty on our stockpiles.","Don't forget all of the strife in Iraq and Afghanistan that resulted from it.","I think strife is a mild way to put it.","Boo hoo.  3000 people.  If Saudi Arabia changes the trade of oil from being done in dollars to being done in Euro, the US economy would collapse and prices of pretty much everything would double in less than a decade.  \n\n3000 people died.  That's sad.  Effect souring relations with SA would have on the living 330,000,000 Americans is far more important.

Are you forgetting that the US Dollar is the World's Reserve Currency and SA has no impact on that? ","The dollar is the reserve currency because it is the oil currency.  If SA changed that, Euro or w/e it became would become the reserve currency.","If they did that then we pull the rug of security out from under them. The Saudis need us more than we need them. We're already an oil exporter.","Not really the majority of our oil is saved for later use.

According to [http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-warns-ofeconomic-fallout-if-congress-passes-9-11-bill.html?referer=](this) article\n\n&gt; The Obama administration has lobbied Congress to block the bill‚Äôs passage, according to administration officials and congressional aides from both parties, and the Saudi threats have been the subject of intense discussions in recent weeks between lawmakers and officials from the State Department and the Pentagon. The officials have warned senators of diplomatic and economic fallout from the legislation.\n\nBar is not the correct word with regards to my statement if you rephrase the question as which  branch of government  ultimately wields the power to bar victims of domestic terrorism from legal redress. \n\nThe Obama Administration nonetheless wields heavy influence over whether or not Congress allows 911 victims this legal recourse. It is wielding this influence in a way which is quite tantamount to barring or blocking progress, I would say. Do you disagree here?","The executive gave itself the power to classify things in an executive order.  That order was challenged in court.  The SCOTUS upheld the executive's right to classify.  The constitution gives the SCOTUS the power to make that decision.\n\nThat's the legal framework.","&gt; Can you clarify where in our legal framework that this sort of reason is deemed valid for withholding information from the US public?\n\nDidn't say it was.\n\n&gt;Can you also explain why you think this gives the American president the right to bar 911 victims from suing the Saudi government?\n\nBecause suing foreign governments is fucking retarded.\n","If that were the case, why not just say that? How is people thinking the Saudi government was possibly officially complicit any better than explaining it was some rogue memebers? ","But reddit doesn't want to hear that.","More like it's a weak excuse. We should be the ones to decide how to react to this information, no matter what the reason is. If it hurts relations with the Saudis (even if it was some \"rogue\" actors in their own government), that is a decision which we the people deserve to be responsible for making - not our government.","Our government is made up of we the people! *We* vote for them. If you have a problem with that, then you need to start an interest group. Otherwise nobody's really interested in this issue.","We can't make decisions as voters when we're being denied important information. If it turns out that a few Saudis were responsible, sure we probably can't blame the whole Saudi government, but if we knew any of this at the time do you think anyone would have gone along with the Iraq war? Or the Patriot Act? Or the domestic spying and eroding of freedoms we've seen in the last 15 years?\n\nAll of that happened because the government whipped up the American public into a frenzy and blamed everyone *except* the Saudis. If any of this came to light immediately, there's a good chance none of that insanity would have happened. If it came to light sometime after the invasion of Iraq but before the 2004 elections, do think there's a snowball's chance in hell Bush would've won again? We might have actually put administration officials on trial for openly lying to us.","How could one start and run an interest group that lobbies etc?","Well you'd need to develop a community of people who agree with you, either starting among real life connections or online, then raise money from that group of people to hire a lobbying firm to represent your group. You'd need to keep motivating that group and you'd need to grow it, because the more people you have in your group, the more money you can raise, but more importantly the more people whose votes you can sway for or against a politician who you need to influence to support your cause. Vote swaying works very well in elections where the person isn't a life long incumbent like a senator, so a representative, or better yet a state or local politician works well. Money becomes more important in incumbents because you can fund opposing/competing candidacies and groups.","But there are so few politicians that would step out of their party line in the interest of government transparency. I'd have to fund those few politicians' campaigns essentially? Is that the only option?","The reason there are so few is because there is little pressure to do so. If enough groups of people pressured them to do so then there would be far more. But transparency is not a hot topic nor a moneymaker so there is currently little pressure. ","So call out and prosecute that rouge asshole. ","The Saudis should be *more than willing* to cut those rogues loose.  They publicly execute people for *far* lesser crimes all the time.\n\nIf bringing the rogue individuals to justice would compromise our relations with the rest of their government, then they are not as \"rogue\" as you claim.","And keeping a secret for no other reason than to protect relations with one of the most morally bankrupt nations on earth somehow isn't a conspiracy?","Except... As others have repeatedly stated... Saudi Arabia is the ideological well from which springs radical Islam.  A LARGE percentage of the royal family supports Wahabi missionary organizations.  The most prominent members have been guilty of some of the worst offenses (the king, the U.S. ambassador, etc.) \n\nThere is an institutional problem with that country and its leadership.  It's like the emperor's new clothes, though: nobody is willing to call them out because of the potential consequences.","Ah, the No True Saudi argument. ","yeah but isnt that kinda bullshit?  Say your brother was stabbed to death, in a murder suicide. Police are trying figure out where the knife came from. The truth is that your best friend accidentally leant the murderer the knife because he didnt realize it would be used as a weapon. Honest mistake, but wouldn't you want you're buddy to share all information he had, so you can get closure instead of wondering forever? \n\nAnd in the case of the 9/11 Its about an attack on the country. Perhaps those who are related are seriously dangerous people. If the saudis were any type of ally at all, those mentioned in the document should be brought to light and defend themselves. A mistake is a mistake, but if my best friend paid a maniac to murded my brother, he sure as hell wouldnt be my friend anymore. ","Because if they knew it was a run by a rogue group of Saudis, then why the hell did we invade Afghanistan?","If some of the evidence or intelligence was gathered using human intelligence sources within the Saudi Government -- be they our agents, another friendly agency (Mossad or MI6) or just pro-US factions/leakers in the KSA, and revealing that evidence would blow our sources' cover.\n\nThis was, in fact, one of the biggest reasons we were pissed about wikileaks. While none of our agents or direct sources were named and targeted -- a lot of people who cooperated with us in Iraq, believing they were building a better country for themselves, were named. And then targeted. We extracted quite a few, and they resettled in the US and get refugee benefits, but the ones we didn't get to in time died. Because they were named in diplomatic cables as helping/useful/receptive to our interests in the region. ","Because foreign policy experts that have spent entire careers on the matter know things that you couldn't even wrap your head around, and those are the people the government employs. Even if you had a picture perfect memory, everything you've seen on the internet, anything you've read pales in comparison to their experience. \n\nThe average citizen looks like a kid with downsyndrome to those experts in the field, so what makes you think you know better? ","Appeal to authority a a bad logical fallacy.

That shit a not only bad form it's fucking rude and ruins your point.","How does it ruin the point? It IS the point, people sit on this website making assumptions about shit they have no clue about as if foreign policy ISN'T some giant spider-web that you have to invest years upon years of study into just to make sense of it. It's a fact and should be basic logic that the majority of people are morons about the majority of things, sorry I'm not here to stroke egos. ","Look at how the American public reacted after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe vast majority of the country was demanding revenge. \n\nImagine what would happen if while the American public was still in grief were told that the Saudis were responsible?\n\nThere would be calls for war with Saudi Arabia. \n\nThe US would never invade Saudi Arabia for many good reasons including the following:\n\nFirst, they have Mecca and Medina which are two of the holiest sites in Islam. Any invasion would unite the Islamic world against the US.\n\nSecond, Saudi Arabia is the key backer of the petrol-dollar. The petrol-dollar helps keep the US dollar strong and maintain its value on the global markets. A strong US dollar encourages foreign investors to buy US treasuries and bonds. This allows the US government to maintain its debt and spending level. \n\nThird, the Saudis invests tens of billions of dollars on US industries, in particular oil and defense. If the Saudis felt threatened by the US government, they could easily threaten to ally with the Chinese (or another country that is a geopolitical opponent of the US) and invest in their weapon industries.   \n\nIf the US were to back off from severely punishing Saudi Arabia while acknowledging that some top Saudi officials were responsible for 9/11, what message do you think it would send to Islamic extremists and other groups that want to attack the US? \n\nThat message is you can safely attack the USA and get away with it if you can develop long-term relations with high-ranking Saudi officials that the Saudi government have no control over. Those top Saudi officials will protect you with their money and influence.\n\n","Look at this relic of the past","Which surely it cannot be.

It is a hell of a mess. But to say it would have happened with or without I highly doubt that, everyone is trying to simply get rid of it not fix it, and the ones that say get rid of it and we will replace it have zero outlines of what they would put in place meaning to me they have nothing and just saying that to get attention.\n\nHillary is worse the Obama by far, probably the worst nominee neck and neck with trump.

","Could you elaborate on how you think it would affect citizens? Curious to hear your thoughts. ","well, i'm no economist by any means, so I'm spitballing here, but: \n\nif the US throws the Saudis under the bus, they'll dump their bonds which would be a huge blow to the Fed, which would probably make them print more money to ease the pain. From there, other countries follow the lead of the Saudis and dump their US debt as well, causing the US $ to spiral.  More bonds being dumped = more money being printed = more inflation. cost of living goes up and up. corporations realise it's too much to do biz in the states, so they start pulling out. jobs are lost, employment benefits start being cut, etc. Stocks would likely drop, and in the process, start wiping out retirement funds and pensions and some would be left with nothing.  I'm probably completely wrong, so you can downvote me into oblivion, I don't really care. It's not like these things would happen over night, it'd be rather gradual as the grandstanding and pissing contests go on and on.

They would sell their bonds, which would be purchased, but not at the same price as today. However, they would have to move their money into another asset (not USD). So that asset would be sold by other investors, who could in theory buy US bonds at their cheaper prices. So, although it would have an effect, it would not be the end of the world. ","genuine question: if the money was moved to another currency, wouldn't that entice other entities to drop the dollar as well? And why would people buy up the US bonds knowing they could very well turn into junk? To me, personally, it just doesn't seem like  smart move. ","Only if the Saudis selling meant that the US government would be unable to pay back the debt (without inflating the currency). As long as everyone else in the world still believes they will be paid back their investment, they won't sell. I don't believe the Saudis have that much influence. Also, the US could always cut spending or raise taxes to offset some of the effect of less buying of the debt, which would give confidence back to the market. My opinion anyways.","How about we allow the people to be sued personally, not the government itself? ","You're right - our masters are only acting in our best interests.

AM DOG","You have to imagine the glass to be totally invisible for a dog. We sort of already know there is glass because we know how doors work, and we know how houses work, we know the purpose of a door, or glass. And a dogs vision is worse than us. Imagine there is suddenly an 100% invisible force field on the street. Basically like 'under the dome'. Just there, without any reason. After running into it a few times you will just assume it's there. And if something suddenly passes you would first walk very carefully to make sure it hasn't moved a few meters (because why not, you would know nothing of this force field)","[removed]","Is there 1 more stair?

He bolted out the front door and put his foot right where the plank should have been. He went face first into concrete....","I agree sort of with what you're saying, but I definitely think dogs can still see both glass and screen doors when they try.  Their vision isn't really so bad that things are just invisible to them.  After running into it a few times, my dog definitely can just see when either the glass door or screen door is closed now, without trying to touch for it or even before he gets near.  It's proved to me because he slows his charge way early when approaching closed glass/screen, and simply whisks straight through it when they're both open.  Only occasionally in weird lighting would he stop to double check but lots of people including myself are just as guilty with screens.. .\n\nI think some dogs are just more or less apt to change their methods of testing for it. Mine adopted checking the way humans do while some dogs just insist on relying on the original primal cues, like pawing for it or seeing a person \"animating\" it open.  Even if a dog is stuck in his old ways I'm still like 99% sure you could train him out of it pretty quickly if you wanted, unless you enjoy watching him be a bonehead.","I think its maybe an old dog because of the hair coloring around his face. Possible also might have poor eye sight but whatever, still endearing, so dog is paying its rent.","If anyone's been through those fairground attractions where you have to walk through a maze of glass doorways or mirrors, it can still be pretty difficult for people.","I have a dog and a glass sliding door \n\nAnd my dog has not run into the glass door a single time ","Maybe if you cleaned it from time to time...","So the dog can run into the door? That's cold.","[removed]","Do dogs understand object permanence?","Yes. The glass is invisible to them, though. Imagine closing your eyes and wandering around your house. You know the layout, but then you find open space where you expected a wall to be. You would have a vague idea that the wall is still there and somewhere close. You'd probably exhibit behavior similar to the dog in OP's gif.","Wait, why is glass invisible to dogs? Can't they see smudges/reflections?","Animals with eyes closer to the ground tend to have poorer vision and animals with eyes further from the ground tend to have better vision.","So bigger animals have better vision than small animals?","Taller, not bigger. Birds are the exception.","So giraffes must have eyes like binoculars.","Well, there's other factors. Animals that climb trees, like humans and monkeys, have better vision than animals that don't.  Humans and other primates also stand upright.  Birds have to have good enough vision to clearly see the ground while flying so they tend to have very good vision, even tiny birds, although the ones that soar very high up like hawks, eagles and vultures probably have better vision than birds like hummingbirds which stay very close to the ground.  Insects tend to have very poor detail vision but it's very specialized to defense and avoidance of threats and can often see motion at a decent distance.  \n\nAlso there are probably animals that buck the trend entirely.  The evolutionary pressure that makes vision more important with a raised perspective is not absolute.  I can't think of an example because I don't really study biology or animals.","I love how similar that is to any human trying to navigate their house in the complete dark","Or drunk\n\n\nOr drunk in the dark","Drunk in the bark","I'm so proud of this dog","He conquered his fears of the invisible wall for bacon!","&gt;for beggin\n\nFTFY","[Source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-KhOAgPlQ4)","*ya gonna come?*\n\n","phrasing!","No, /r/SexWithDogs","Theres your risky click of the day.

Why are kids stealing 2800 cars in that city?","I live here in St. Pete, and there's a big problem in terms of the rubbing up of two opposite socioeconomic regions right next to each other. Especially downtown St. Pete, there is tons of money in the central area. Go literally one street south or west, and you're in the hood. And it stays that way till you get close to the other side of the Pinellas peninsula. So you have tons of expensive cars and nice high rises within one to five streets of the ghetto. Im originally from Sarasota, which has very little poverty, so you don't have many stolen cars. I've lived in Tampa, which is a large metro area. I don't know how many stolen cars are there, but I assume a fair number based on population. However, Tampa is far more sectioned off. So the wealthy areas are often far removed and have middle class stuff in between. St. Pete, Sarasota, and Tampa are all within 45 minutes to an hour of one another. Yet St. Pete is where you hear of a huge number of car jackings. Its just a really strange mix.","I'm from Tampa but live in east Harlem; when I moved here I was nervous because of how I've seen NYC portrayed in movies/television. This place is like a petting zoo compared to the  Serengeti that is the Bay Area. ","Serengeti is a good way to portray it. Some parts are insanely nice and I absolutely love living near them, but other places I wouldn't get within a mile of. For instance, I never spend time in any part of Manatee county haha their largest building is their county jail. I like parts of Tampa, but I won't even drive through certain areas. Pinellas is splotched to hell and back with pockets of nice development and places you need police escort just to hit up a Publix. My sister lives in Manhattan, so I get up there pretty frequently, and I have to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised at how non-scary Harlem was. ","New York has really cleaned up in the past few decades.

How does news today compare to the news 40 or 50 years ago? Were news ever reliable? ","I wish I had those answers. I think we all need to be actively involved with performing some basic research when we see articles that are weighed heavy towards one end of the story. The more important the story, the more research needs to be done. I like to come straight to the comments here on reddit because it has the potential to do just this on a collective level. But even then we should always have some doubt.\n\nBottom line is that we just need to live with a great deal of cynicism. I don't think the news was any less or more reliable than it is now, if anything I'd say it is better now because of the sheer number of sources and outlets. But again this only means that we need to research deeper into finding out whether or not they are reliable or have an ulterior motive. ","Good. I'm all for calling out shitty police work, but this isn't an example of it. Cops aren't trained or equipped for technical rescue, the fire department generally handles that sort of work. And a car in 15 feet of murky water with a soft mud bottom is very much a technical rescue.\n\nShort of this pond being adjacent to a manned fire station, there wasn't much that could be done without serious risks (and not the kind they accept as part of their job description) to the officers on the scene. Untrained and inexperienced personnel attempting such a rescue is a very bad idea.\n\nIt's a shit situation all around, and a shame three teenagers died as a result. Had those officers on the scene not even attempted to enter the water would be one thing, but they did and assessed the situation as being beyond the scope of their training and equipment on hand.\n\nedit: words n stuff","I'm trained in technical rescue, and just about the very first rule of rescue is \"don't add another victim\".\n\nAs shitty as it is for the victims already involved, there are a lot of situations where it's just too dangerous for rescuers to go in, and I can promise you that the rescuers want to go in as much as anybody else does. The only difference between them and the public is that the rescuers are thinking ahead, from training and experience, at what the consequences could be if they themselves end up needing to be rescued.","In my late teens I was trained as a first responder too. Did some wilderness search and rescue training as well. \n\nHad to attempt to save my cousin who was caught in a rip current once. Had to make one of the hardest decisions of my life to leave him after he slipped out of my arms when I had been rescue swimming him back toward shore. I could feel myself fading and getting panicked, so I made the decision to remove myself from the equation after he slipped away. Can't say I'm proud of leaving him and swimming for shore, but my training and instinct to follow it saved my life. \"Don't add another victim\" as you said. \n\nThankfully my cousin ended up making it back to shore after I got in and someone had realized what was going on and gotten a lifeguard from up the beach. \n\n**EDIT:** (Because some people seem to have problems looking through comments to find where I posted this.)

Wth society??","I live right down the road from this pond.

They do but its always at great risk to themselves and its because a asshat wanted some shitty fish.

Heck, even recently, 15 heavy freakin cars went through the ice in Lake Geneva...after it had been warm out for a while...because they thought the ice next to the shore was thicker...\n\nIf there's a lake near a big city in the Midwest, then I can guarantee you there's a either a small Coast Guard station nearby to watch over the idiots that use it during the winter or a group of firefighters that get trained in ice rescues and are stationed nearby.","&gt;I'm a first responder myself and the first rule of any rescue is don't create more patients. \n\nI wish more people understood this.\n\nLEO, general first responders and most private citizens are simply not trained or equipped to handle technical rescue operations.\n\nPeople expect LEO to rush in and save them or others in situations that are well beyond their training.\nWhile quite a few will do just that, it goes against what they're trained to do.\nThis has the unfortunate consequence of making another victim needing rescue or dieing.","He did an admirable job articulating his frustration without devolving into histrionics or defensiveness.

She's asking questions that would've been answered if she'd read the media packet the sheriff's office provided. Why go to a press conference uninformed?

We would've posted the whole thing in its entirety for readers to watch. \nI can completely feel this sheriff's frustration. ","Yeah she seemed more like a blogger than a reporter.

Video isn't going to solve every problem with police credibility, in the wrong hands it can lead to these media shit shows.","It's actually an interesting phenomenon, how quickly bad information can go viral, and how seemingly reputable news outlets don't pick up on that bad information.\n\nUnfortunately it's not as simple as \"they need to do a better job\", primarily because the public rewards the kind of reporting that leads to misinformation being spread, while punishing news outlets that have failed to adapt to this kind of content output.\n\nRemember the phrase \"If you're not paying for a product, you ARE the product\"? This applies to 90% of modern media today.\n\nKotakuInAction is the best example of this. Ostensibly the sub (was) is about fairness in gaming media, with many upset at how advertisers and other game developers take priority over the readers and actual gamers. This is the case, without a doubt, but why would Kotaku and other video game journalism websites do anything different? The people that pay them are game developers and advertisers, making them the customer. They pay these websites because they attract clicks. The more clicks you get, the more you can charge for advertising or promotion on your site.\n\nBefore news aggregators, newspapers charged advertisers more based on their distribution numbers. Same concept as clicks, except the reason your newspaper had more distribution was because it had more and better stories. This required a specific kind of person, a journalist, who could not only get a story, but write it in an interesting way. These institutions came with a LOT of rules, though, mostly enforced in-house. Fairness, accuracy, contemporaneousness, and news-worthiness were the major factors for getting a story out, because that is what your readers expected and demanded. If you had a great front page story, your competition couldn't copy that story until the next print cycle.\n\nFlash forward to today, and the second a story is broken, someone else has it, someone with better social media presence and online distribution methods than the original outlet that filed the story. These companies are not staffed with journalists. They are staffed with SoMe savvy writers that can turn a story around in a flash, get it on social media, and have people engaging. This in turn prompts more of the same once the story begins to go viral.\n\nBut the \"reputable\" news outlets need to get in on this action as well. That's where the money is, after all. But there isn't a single news outlet today that has a staff as good as they did 10 years ago. The demand for free content has driven them into the ground. Unable to pay proper journalists, many have hired highly underskilled writers that can churn this shit out. They don't know how to fact find, they don't know where they cross the line into opinion, and they don't know the kind of effect they can have on the public.\n\nTL;DR - if people demanded to PAY for their news, instead of getting it for free, this would hardly be an issue.\n\nEDIT: great that this is generating some discussion. I'm too busy to participate at the moment, but it'd be remiss not to mention The Economist in this context. It is the only newspaper (yes, it's classified as a newspaper) that has grown year on year in subscriptions since the wider industry collapsed. \n\nA couple interesting facts that I don't have the time to look up properly right now:\n\nMore than 60% of the company's revenue comes from subscriptions. IIRC the bundle subscription (digital + print) costs a fraction more than Netflix. They're the only paper that gets most of its money that way afaik. \n\nThose subscriptions are broken down into three categories: print only, digital only, and both. Interestingly, it is the under 35 demo that prefers the print only subscription, while over 35 prefers digital only.","There is actually a historic parallel with newspapers before the subscription model, where the \"Yellow Press\" hyped up and invented news to get people to buy papers.\n\nIt was to the point where people didn't believe that wars had actually started because the papers ran stories about imminent war all the time.\n\nThey fixed this in newspapers by going to a subscription model.

But there are tons of problems with paying for news too I think. Newspaper outlets will print whatever makes the most money ultimately, whether you're going for profit or not. \n\nI believe this to be true because in order to make a profit many of these sources will spend most of their own resources on distributing their media, instead of increasing the quality of what the consumer demands. Many intelligent people read the news and demand nothing but the best stories for sure. But there are also a ton of people who aren't so savvy or intelligent and they demand news too, and it's usually not very good quality. \n\nMaybe it's just my opinion but I think there are only a handful of sources that are even worth the read. Don't get me wrong, some private companies do a mostly fine job (NYT for example) but there are other sources that are more worth my time, and most of them are free due to taxpayer money. NPR and BBC are examples of finding the right story without too much bias involved. Other countries like Switzerland have TV's in public that play public news, where they are required by law to be unbiased by giving equal attention to both sides of an issue, candidate, etc. I've never visited but I have friends who have studied abroad in Europe and they say that the average European is more news savvy than the average American. I'd guess it's due to their laws on public news and how widespread it seems to be. \n\nSo I think that due to US laws (or lack thereof) our public news isn't as good except maybe for NPR. I'd just personally rather see someone watching BBC on tv than drowning in the monotonous, super biased private companies like FOX, MSNBC, etc. \n\nSo I guess I'm saying that I don't disagree with you at all, just pointing out problems from the other side and coming to the conclusion that there should be some sort of in between and or rules/regulations in place in America.

","Oh, just wait for the asshole to come along and say \"Life happened\".\n\n... or how about shitty parenting, no disciplinary action taken to prevent this behaviour.","Copying my reply here:\n\nComing from a resident of St. Pete: \n\n\nI'm sure this is going to get buried and I'll probably end up deleting this, but shame on whoever among you feels the need to insult, degrade, or make fun of these girls.\n\n\nI'll preface this argument with this: I fully believe that the officers did as much as they could, and of course those girls should not have stolen their car. The narrative that the police are at fault in this case is dangerous and incorrect. The girls, on their own free will, stole the car, ran it into the pond, and unfortunately paid the ultimate price for that. \n\n\nHowever, I would like you to think about the environment that these girls grew up in and the cycle of poverty and crime that exists in St. Petersburg. Recently, the Tampa Bay Times published a [Pulitzer Prize winning multi-part report on the plight of the public school system in Pinellas county](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/). Specifically, they focused on the southside of St. Petersburg, which has constantly been on the short end of the stick as far as educational policies go. Whether it's [ending a system that was pushing further integration in schools (St. Pete is historically segregated, so when you stop pushing integration of the schools, they naturally become segregated)](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/5-schools-segregation/), [outdated suspension policies that put children further behind](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/discipline/), or [moving specialty programs (that don't have busses) out of the poorer neighborhoods](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/fundamental-schools/) making it almost impossible for lower income students to attend. The very schools that at least two of these girls (the third was not from the city) were likely to attend are some of the **absolute worst in the state of Florida**, when schools to the north of the city and county are thriving. The school board of Pinellas County has failed to foster a safe environment of growth and has effectively pushed back \n\nTo look at this situation as an individual event without considering the history of St. Petersburg would be a blatant oversight. Affirmative action exists to bring equality after the rights and privileges of people living in these neighborhoods were trampled for generations. While not well known, [the desegregation efforts of St. Pete were not easy](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2671&amp;context=etd) and we're only just starting to get on the road to fixing the errors of our past. \n\nIs it unfortunate that we have to deal with bringing equality to our communities? Of course it is, I would love to have a magic wand that can undo decades of prejudice, violence, and oppression. But it's going to take work to get there. \n\nI understand these girls were \"delinquents\" and their criminal records clearly show that. But why do these girls, and so many of their peers have similar records when if you go 10 blocks north this is unheard of? \n\nIf the answer you give to this question is that the lack of quality parenting is the sole reason behind this unfortunate situation, then you and I have different worldviews. \n\nYou can't understand the world through a pinhole, the context and history of our society is important to understanding where we're headed. The cycle of poverty and crime is not one that can be passively ended, especially with countercurrent forces reversing progress at the same time. \n\nThe girls shouldn't have stolen the car, and the cops were just doing their jobs. But don't speak ill of these girls as if you know their life or their circumstances. \n\ntldr: St. Pete has a lot of poverty and crime. It has for a long time. We need to understand that this is a product of the cities history and that steps need to be taken to address its inequalities if things like this are going to stop.\n\n","1st gen here.  Grew up in the ghettos during the 80s, crack dealers and all.  Although my parents were decent parents unlike these kids, my childhood environment was poor and plenty dangerous.  We were poor and lived in poverty but I never resorted to felony level criminal activities, certainly not GTAs.  Here's the thing, in the hood you see and hear all types of crazy stuff, you can differentiate the good and bad at that age and you can either embrace it or reject it.  You want to do hood shit, fine then you might get caught up, but don't bitch and complain when you get caught and blame it on your upbringing.  Life isn't fair and you play the hand you're dealt, you can either learn hang out the right people and move above the stupidity or get caught up and drown in the stupidity.  It's your choice, just don't make excuses and blame societies failure when you become a statistic.The odds might be against you but you still have a choice in all matters.  Not everyone who's poor and lives in the ghetto are criminals.  Sure you can find a lot of bad in the hood, but in the end it's still about you your choice and your strength in character.","I'm in total agreement that people can make the best of their situations, and we should promote that kind of optimistic thinking. No one is doomed by their circumstances, and with hard work and perseverance I've seen plenty of kids with bleak outlooks become successful. \n\nHowever, I just see a disconnect in your logic. You say that it's your choice and your strength of character that determine if you succeed or not, but what factors contribute to that? I can see the argument that it's about the home life and the \"ghetto culture\", but I'm left wondering why the home life and ghetto culture are the way they are. Here's an analogy I used in an earlier comment:\n\nThink about this scenario, there's Group A and Group B in a city. While the city is growing and creating an identity, Group A oppresses Group B and prevents them from developing at a similar rate, at which point crime and poverty become the norm. Then, they decide that those laws were bad and those kinds of policies are going to be a thing of the past.Don't you think it would take longer than 50 years for things to normalize? \n\nDon't you think that unless there was an active effort by Group A to bring equality, that it would be much harder for Group B to grow? Do you think that if you were part of Group B you would be able to rise above this?\n\nI'm not saying that the people in the southside are victims. I'm saying that the rest of St. Petersburg needs to see that we're one city and leaving that area to figure things out for themselves is not going to solve the problems, it's going to require collaborative solutions to bring equality to our city. \n\nQuick Edit: You mention that the odds are against these kids from the start, don't you see that being a problem in and of itself? Why should they have the odds stacked against them from day one because they were born on the wrong side of Central Ave.?\n","Well, just as a note, we _do_ pay for network news and it's not really much better.

Unfortunately many people are fucking stupid and will believe anything they see on the internet or TV as 100% fact. \n\nThere's a reason in college (especially graduate level) that you need to cite your sources. There's also a reason that certain sources are not considered credible. They get reputations of lying, stretching truths, taking things out of context for a narrative, or being flat out wrong without fact checking. They're sometimes called entertainment, tabloids, or opinion sources... even if the outlet bills itself as a news source. TYT meets many of the criteria to not be a credible source. Surprisingly, many long standing magazines that people consider credible are not 100% always credible, and you need to also research the author to know their background as well.\n\nBut often times, an outlet/publication may constantly publish false/non-credible claims and anything published on it is then considered non-credible. It's why after a while, certain reputable writers or analysts will refuse to go on certain networks and/or write for certain publications. They don't want to damage their credibility.\n\nIf it's just one source claiming something on a popular topic and it isn't a peer reviewed paper/article that's in a journal or publication, chances are it isn't credible.  If there are many also claiming it, but they all source back to that one bullshit source? Again, it's not credible.\n\nTYT made claims about this incident taken out of context. Most of the reports were just linked back to their out-of-context report. The sheriff came out and corrected/scolded the media for pushing that message, when there was an extensive report and other videos that clearly shot down TYT's narrative. TYT says they're lying/covering it up. They have no proof/evidence/information to back up this claim other than the video they took out of context of the rest of the video. \n\nThis is how dangerous rumors and views are created.

You can tell this pond was very mucky just by the vegetation (thick cattails) alone. \nCattails thrive in muck.

And alligators feed at night (that's always a real concern whether or not it's rational - and I'm not debating that at all). \n\nI'd bet the cops couldn't wade through the muck to even GET to the water.

The first is that the police chief is completely out of touch with reality if he honestly believes that the public doesn't have the right to question the veracity of local law enforcement information releases when civilians die. You're damn right people want to see video before believing anything claimed by law enforcement. This may be an example of good police work, but his claiming it to be so, does nothing to convince anyone who is paying attention to the daily reports of police abuse and cover-ups. Secondly, the fact that there are ineffective, incompetent or biased people reporting and conjecturing about the facts of the incident, does not implicitly indicate that local law enforcement's version of events is accurate or truthful. Too often the emotions driving the \"victim's\" supporters, cause them to lash-out with wild, or unsupported accusations that are then used as a weapon by law enforcement to focus attention away from the holes and inconsistencies in their own claims and onto the irrational or poorly supported claims of the victim's supporters.","Attempting to rescue *any* person who is drowning is risky and that's assuming that they're just flailing around in the water and not inside a vehicle. I'm no lifeguard, but I believe they have special training to safely rescue their victims that maximizes their personal safety.

If you're a police officer in the United States, it doesn't matter if you're right, because no matter what, you're wrong. An officer's badge does not replace his heart; to question whether or not these officers made an attempt to rescue the girls is absolute bullshit.

It's that the company, as a whole, doubled down on censorship, creating false narratives, corruption, and identity politics.","Oi, I can post an entire analysis of everything wrong with That particular writer's behavior in that situation (and I'm not pretending to be neutral towards Kotaku. look at my posting history).\n\nI'll keep it short, though. \n\n1. they were nowhere near neutral on that particular individual. In the roughly two weeks before the termination, they were chastising any critics to the particular job she was doing (PR for a game localization), defended controversial theses she wrote that, while not wrong, was certainly not fit for the image Nintendo wants to portray, and dragged a 3rd-party, anti child-trafficking organization concerned about said theses into an internet quarrel she wanted no part of.\n\n2. their original piece was a rush-out-the-door, keejerk reaction after seeing a tweet from the individual being fired. IGN followed up less than an hour after their piece with Nintendo's official statement, and instead made her firing seem to be due to sexism in Nintendo and giving in to the demands of \"bigots\".  This follow-up was at least a week later, only after a new angle behind her fining was dug up by the internet (i.e., when the story was \"hot\" again).\n\n3. in this very piece, he briefly (as in two sentences) brings up the long standing issue of localization in games, and then decides to confound it with a complete divergence into the Gamergate controvesy, implying that it's impossible to discuss this and many other serious issues in the industry without first discussing the issues of unrelated phenomenon like online harassment, identity politics, etc. Even though there have been dozens of instances post-Gamergate in which that exact thing has been done.\n\nThat was already twice as much as I wanted to type, so I'll refrain myself now.

So it's a multi-fold problem. You're more than welcome to focus on one factor, but it's not the only factor. ","When you describe transparency issues, are you referring to protocol being common knowledge or just overall shadiness in many police department. I do agree that departments with historically shitty documented behavior and lack of repercussions on said officers deserve an audit / outside accountability. Not sure how to implement that but something along those lines would be helpful.\n\nAlso, another multifold factor would be the culture in low income areas. Youths idolize artists that preach anti-cop / anti-personal responsibility rhetoric. ","To only stick to the topic of my original response, and stay out of the rabbit hole we are going down, when I say they need to be more transparent, I'm saying that many police departments can do a better job at being timely with releasing details of certain cases. It does appear as in the last decade, or perhaps just because I'm getting older and seeing it more often, that some police departments will often go on smear campaigns, before releasing details, rather than being objective and forthcoming when facts are known. It also doesn't help that many media outlets are afraid to paint an officer in a bad light, or bring scrutiny to a department, so they will write articles in such a way to make it appear that the officer or department was always in the right. So part of being a journalist, is trying to get to the truth, without being misleading. And part of being a good police department, is being transparent.","Part of the media job should be to explain these types of things to the uninformed public.","But the media isn't always aware of these things because of the lack of transparency. So either the media makes stuff up, or they only report what they know. It's not the media's job to make police departments more transparent. That's on the department heads. ","That's fine, but the public needs to realize outrage isn't always appropriate when you don't understand the situation. ","The problem isn't that it's ignored, it's that it's information not made readily available to the public.\n\nThe media wants to report a story with a certain spin or narrative, at this point a lot of media outlets are doing any and everything to discredit the police force.\n\nThey aren't exactly going to include the facts that show that the police were actually doing a very good job in this situation.\n\nThe public gets it's information from the media, but when the media only reports the points that are continuing their narrative or the things that make them money, it's very difficult for the public to inform themselves fully on any given situation.","Some people know how to party.","No doubt that should have stopped everyone in the room and all questions should have gone to her using Facebook as a source","i mean if an arsonist sets a house on fire then stands in the middle and yells for help, I don't expect cops to run in to save him. it's sad the girls died but the blame falls on them and their parents.

","I'm in emergency services. I've seen, as a witness to incidents, blatant lying or misrepresented facts by the media to get a greater kick from a story. This ranges from little local outfits to the big names including print, TV and Internet.

This police officer has nothing to hide and therefore should not be upset that the question was asked especially since he believes the facts are on his side. Police have a 200 plus year history of abusing their power that continues to this day. The penalty for stealing 7 cars and resisting arrest should not be death by drowning. That said, it was incredibly unprofessional to lash out at the media. THE POLICE ANSWER TO THE PUBLIC, ITS NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

The sheriff is angry that the media is trying to twist it as their deaths are the police's fault and that the deputy's didn't try to do their jobs and save them from drowning. He has every right to be angry at the media.","It's irresponsible for the media to not do their job and read/show the entirety of what they're given.  A news report of \"it was too dangerous for officers to enter\" is not as rating grabbing as \"officers watch teens die and don't even try\".   \n\nHe's not  upset because they're asking if all was done, he's upset because they released the info about what was done and the media only released a snippet that conformed to the story they wanted to tell","I don't have the numbers or papers or anything in front of me, I don't care enough to look it up so you can take this with a grain of salt.\n\nHowever, research generally shows the largest corelation for kids doing stuff like this is poverty. A child in poverty generally has a lot of hurdles that others don't. If they aren't getting enough to eat it can screw with brain development. Their parents are often times uneducated and ignorant. (As this girls mother clearly was) That means they generally don't have anyone to teach them anything outside of school.\n\n They often only have one available parent who works instead of raising them or said parent is out getting laid, drunk, stoned or all three. \n\nThe parents often don't place much value on education. Even if the kid does get an interest of some kind, they might not have access to the internet, a library or books. \n\nAlso, quite frankly, a lot of these kids have probably had to steal to eat, when you are raised in a situation like that, where society has failed you so utterly that you have to steal to eat as a child? Why the fuck would you have any respect for that society?\n\nTo drive my point home, according to census projections as of 2014, there are 166,981 children under the age of 18 that live in Pinellas County, the place where this took place. Of those children, 7,000 of them are 'chronically hungry' that's just over 4%. Which means pretty much at least 1 kid in every school classroom is probably going to bed hungry at night. When you take the richer kids that go the private schools out of the picture? You're looking at several kids in each public classroom.\n\nThat Sheriff, he's really trying, but he simply isn't capable of improving the problem. It seems society only gives a shit about poor kids either before they are born or when they end up dying while committing a crime. *That* is what has to be fixed for that problem to go away.","Shitty parents is the main problem, but how do you fix it? Make somebody take an IQ test before being able to have a baby?","maybe not an IQ test but there should be some way to license reproduction to prevent creating children you don't care for. violaters should be sterilized in a reversible way. it's what they owe to society #fairshare","Agreed.","They aren't shitty parents because they were born to be that way inherently. They are shitty parents because they were raised in an identical kind of environment, and since a large chunk of the population is black, their grandparents had it even shittier. \n\nHow do you fix this problem? Raise minimum wage so parents can afford to actually feed, house and clothe their children, pump more money into inner city schools in order to improve classroom experience and give funding to extracurricular activities like sports, math, science and art clubs. Make school lunches and breakfasts free across the board for all students. Subsidize internet access and make some form of higher education available to everyone. This will make the kids better adults and in turn, better parents who can raise a generation of decent people.","your solution to crime is to give them everything free. this is a much worse situation than thieves create currently","I guess if you decide to have kids and can't afford to feed yourself, e.g. making minimum wage, you're probably not smart enough to be having kids. That should probably be another question on the test. Median income has been going up in this country when taking into account inflation since they started keeping track of it in the sixties. Higher education is available to everyone now with FAFSA making it possible for kids of low wage parents to attend community college for free. Throwing money at inner city schools were the parents are on heroin all day without a job isn't going to fix those schools, but it probably wouldn't hurt but the money could probably be better spent on the test.","The cars that are stolen the most are usually the older models or beat up cars.","IIRC they are used for a joy ride/burner.","Yep, many 90s cars only had a handful of keys for each model and no security alarm.\n\nNot like anyone needs the keys anyway because those cars can easily be stolen by simply breaking a window and starting it with a screwdriver.","You guys are shoving your heads in the sand and then complaining there are no journalists a foot deep in the beach.

So no, they were not chased to death, and any policy regarding breaking off pursuit would not have had a better outcome. ","What?","I QUESTION WHETHER THESE KIDS WERE \"CHASED TO DEATH\"? WAS THERE A POLICY IN PLACE WHERE BREAKING OFF PURSUIT WOULD HAVE RESULTED I A BETTER OUTCOME?","This shit is so unfunny. ","Now that you are screaming I understand\n\nEdit: but seriously, they wouldn't have been chased had they just stopped. How did the police chase them to death. The chase was their decision","I didn't say they were chased to death. Some jurisdictions have a policy whereby they will discontinue fast pursuit if the situation might cause unreasonable harm if the chase was to continue.","A car chase is inherently dangerous.\n\n In rare instances they'll break off a chase if the chase presents an *overwhelming* threat to the public, (i.e.: broad daylight, the criminal is shooting at random people and ramming cars to try and get away while being chased) they'll back off and use helicopters to track the movements. When it's 4AM with nobody on the road? Probably not. They don't know that there are just kids in the car, they only find that out once they catch them. ","The jurisdiction I moved from some years ago had a policy that would see any chase discontinued if the escapee demonstrated high potential to cause his/her own death also. The policy was made to protect stupid kid drivers and the like from crashing etc. This policy was enforced at any time of the day, whether or not traffic or circumstances were a factor. It worked very well. ","I highly doubt that what you are describing was an actual policy. \n\nThe problem with that policy is that it encourages any potential escapee to be as reckless as possible because they'll know the chase will be discontinued if that was the case. E.g. \"Pull over? Well I have weed on me and my license is suspended, let me just go speeding into oncoming traffic for a bit and they'll give up on chasing me.\" \n","This is the actual gist of the policy. I moved from a small town where escape routes can be easily protected, and there are few roads that can withstand, let alone facilitate high speed chases. Once you get outside of the town proper, highways are easily monitored, and often police will just wait at off ramps with spikes. Police chases are few and far between because of just these few factors. Add to this the fact that extremely poor city planning many years ago actually makes it hard to accumulate any great amount of speed, and the primary roads are more like secondary roads with well protected boundaries. Add to this, a well trained and equipped PD and the policy works. I cannot recall one single incidence where a \"runner\" has been forced off the road by any driving tactic. Crazy maybe, but true.","Alright, well then maybe it happens in your town but I really don't believe it would work in many other places. ","Car chases are extremely dangerous (for everyone, including bystanders), and very difficult to regulate. I wouldn't be surprised if the girls were chased to death.\n\nEssentially, there are entire manuals about when to give up pursuit, but cops are too amped/panicked to apply the rules in the moment.","They actually killed themselves. Idk if you watched the video but they drove into a lake.","But they actually did abandon the pursuit multiple times and the family is actually suggesting that was what lead to their deaths.\n\n\"Miller, the girl's uncle, asked why deputies didn't use their emergency lights in the cemetery.\n\n\"Had they turned on their emergency lights sooner and stopped this vehicle from going into the pond,\" Miller said, \"these girls would still be alive.\"\n\nGualtieri called that \"naive.\" He noted the driver had already refused to stop for a sheriff's cruiser using its emergency lights, ran two red lights and appeared to be trying to flee before plunging into the pond..\"","crime is extremely dangerous.

And that is coming from someone who has had a stay in the county facilities.","Isn't the ice next to the shore actually thinner?","\"Sheriff Gualtieri, Bob Loblaw with Gawker Media, Facebook says....\" (probably)\n","Why would you be sorry for that?","At a certain point, police can only do so much. The threat that comes from police is, generally, that they're going to arrest you if they catch you stealing the car. If you seriously believe that you will not be caught (which isn't surprising for kids of that age), the thought of police no longer holds any weight.\n\nOn top of that, some of the kids clearly don't care given that the officer in the video citied multiple children with well over 10 previous arrests. They've played this game before. If they get caught, they know the drill. They get some minor punishment because they are underage and then they're back to stealing cars in a few months.

The narrative that the police are at fault in this case is dangerous and incorrect. The girls, on their own free will, stole the car, ran it into the pond, and unfortunately paid the ultimate price for that. \n\n\nHowever, I would like you to think about the environment that these girls grew up in and the cycle of poverty and crime that exists in St. Petersburg. Recently, the Tampa Bay Times published a [Pulitzer Prize winning multi-part report on the plight of the public school system in Pinellas county](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/). Specifically, they focused on the southside of St. Petersburg, which has constantly been on the short end of the stick as far as educational policies go. Whether it's [ending a system that was pushing further integration in schools (St. Pete is historically segregated, so when you stop pushing integration of the schools, they naturally become segregated)](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/5-schools-segregation/), [outdated suspension policies that put children further behind](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/discipline/), or [moving specialty programs (that don't have busses) out of the poorer neighborhoods](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/fundamental-schools/) making it almost impossible for lower income students to attend. The very schools that at least two of these girls (the third was not from the city) were likely to attend are some of the **absolute worst in the state of Florida**, when schools to the north of the city and county are thriving. The school board of Pinellas County has failed to foster a safe environment of growth and has effectively pushed back \n\nTo look at this situation as an individual event without considering the history of St. Petersburg would be a blatant oversight. Affirmative action exists to bring equality after the rights and privileges of people living in these neighborhoods were trampled for generations. While not well known, [the desegregation efforts of St. Pete were not easy](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2671&amp;context=etd) and we're only just starting to get on the road to fixing the errors of our past. \n\nIs it unfortunate that we have to deal with bringing equality to our communities? Of course it is, I would love to have a magic wand that can undo decades of prejudice, violence, and oppression. But it's going to take work to get there. \n\nI understand these girls were \"delinquents\" and their criminal records clearly show that. But why do these girls, and so many of their peers have similar records when if you go 10 blocks north this is unheard of? \n\nIf the answer you give to this question is that the lack of quality parenting is the sole reason behind this unfortunate situation, then you and I have different worldviews. \n\nYou can't understand the world through a pinhole, the context and history of our society is important to understanding where we're headed. The cycle of poverty and crime is not one that can be passively ended, especially with countercurrent forces reversing progress at the same time. \n\nThe girls shouldn't have stolen the car, and the cops were just doing their jobs. But don't speak ill of these girls as if you know their life or their circumstances. \n\ntldr: St. Pete has a lot of poverty and crime. It has for a long time. We need to understand that this is a product of the cities history and that steps need to be taken to address its inequalities if things like this are going to stop.\n\n","this is the product of a lazy ghetto culture.

While the city is growing and creating an identity, Group A oppresses Group B and prevents them from developing at a similar rate, at which point crime and poverty become the norm. Then, they decide that those laws were bad and those kinds of policies are going to be a thing of the past. \n\nDon't you think it would take longer than 50 years for things to normalize? Don't you think that unless there was an active effort by Group A to bring equality, that it would be much harder for Group B to grow? Do you think that if you were part of Group B you would be able to rise above this? ","This is grade A bullshit.

It's a police officers account of what transpired. And there is proof in many cases where police reports were falsified. This day in age I don't take a police report over video. It's obviously been a very highly cut clip but it's clear what that cop said in the video. ","That isn't really the point though. The job of a journalist is to do the work and research, that includes reading the police report and determining what is true and what is not, which should be a hell of a lot easier with video. It is also very common for the media to twist a story to fit their narrative, if you're not going to trust a police report then you shouldn't be trusting a news report either. ","&gt;and determining what is true and what is not\n\nIt's not even to go that far. A journalist should do the work and research to find the facts and then report them.\n\nIt should be then up to the reader who has been given all the facts to make a judgement on what parts of whose stories are true or not.\n\nThe problem is we've gotten to a point where people will readily accept and believe the opinion of someone else immediately because they can't be bothered to do the research themselves.\n\nSome journalists take advantage of this by putting biases on articles because they know a good portion of the public aren't going to fact check them on it.","Exactly it like telling if a girl is into you. Just keep your wit up.","Oh good. I don't trust anything with out sources.","The journalist was asking questions. Had she reported anything yet? Nothing wrong with asking questions that people in the community are asking. Gives the officer a chance to respond. The system seemed to work here","I believe in this context reading the report refers to doing research. Fact checking would be the process whereby she vetted her research against itself to determine what happened.","Also there was apparently corroborating video in the police report.","A fact which, ironically, op seems to be ignoring to fit his narrative.\n\n","Absolutely, no one source is accurate. Cameras miss context and aren't always pointing the right direction. Police report are written by people involved in the incident so they want to keep themselves clean of any wrongdoing. \n\nIMO not reading the police report and only watching the video is just like only reading the police report and not watching the video. You have to take in all the accounts of what happens and form your own opinion. ","But you absolutely cannot take facebook over a police report. ","I would any day of the week.

This would mean a police report was not just an officers account but the results of investigation from internal affairs as well.","Up front, I don't know too much about this incident, and am not commenting on this specific one or this specific case. That being said, I don't trust internal affairs to do valid investigations. They work for the department and have nothing to gain by conducting an unbiased department damaging investigation. Infact, an investigation that ends up showing that an officer did anything illegal just makes the department look bad. The Chief or Sheriff has zero interest in having their department look bad, hence the DOJ having to come in and investigate departments.","That's all well and good for you, but this is a reporter. \n\nShe's trying to stir the pot by saying people on facebook say the police are lying because their clothes aren't wet. She's hiding behind the argument of another person, neither of which had probably read the police reports (the reporter by her own admission). \n\nPoint being that if you are going to question the police in a press briefing, at least read what they reported first before reporting what some second-hand keyboard detective says. It's lousy journalism to not get both sides of the story before asking questions, especially when you haven't gotten the side of the department you are asking questions to. The sheriff basically could have said the \"it's in the police report\" and been done with the question.

The female of some Old World cuckoos lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, leaving them to be cared for by the resident nesters. This parasitic tendency has given the female bird a figurative reputation for unfaithfulness as well. Hence in Old French we find the word cucuault, composed of cocu, \"cuckoo, cuckold,\" and the pejorative suffix -ald and used to designate a husband whose wife has wandered afield like the female cuckoo. An earlier assumed form of the Old French word was borrowed into Middle English by way of Anglo-Norman.

It bugged me.\n\nBut I wasn't harmed, only my pride was hurt, I felt ashamed that the kids were scared that something bad was going to happen. But knowing how officers see the world I sort of get it.

Cops can just make up reasons to pull you over, as many of you are probably already aware.  Twice I actually had the officers tell me that, No you werent doing anything wrong, I just wanted to pull you over and check you out.  I will say that I think the one time was kind of justified, as it was 4 a.m. on a local schools prom night.

I've seen numerous TYT videos where they do just that though. In one video, Cenk criticized a police officer for discharging their gun at an assailant who was holding a pipe up as if to attack from just five feet away -- only discharging after repeated commands to the assailant to drop their weapon, I might add. \n\nHonestly though, that's not surprising. Most of the people who criticize cops for shooting an armed assailant think that cops should be able to easily disarm somebody sprinting up with a knife from just a couple feet away.\n\nEdit: Oh god, is that segment seriously called \"Copping Out??\"","It's worse than Fox News.

Even shooting a shitty BB handgun gives you an idea of how difficult it can be to shoot accurately under *ideal* circumstances. Add that to the fact that cops should only be pulling out their gun in *stressful life or death situations* and it becomes pretty damn straightforward that shooting somebody's leg is out of the question. \n\nHonestly, shooting somebody in the leg isn't that bad of a reason to be suspicious of whether the cop should have used their gun in the first place, given that if a cop is in a situation where they can shoot somebody in the leg who is running towards them chances are the situation is not dire enough for them to pull out their gun at all. ","I saw the \"Facebook\" video when in came out. Even then the 45 second tidbit you did see was heavily edited. I was skeptical when I saw the video and I thought what they were trying to pass off as \"Evidence\" was quite skeptical. \n\nSo my opinion on this is \"There is no physical 'proof' (As in video evidence or witness reports besides officers) therefore there is no way to prove or disprove what was said to have happened here.

Instead they chose the death penalty from their actions that night. Why wasn't the woman asked why her young daughter was out in the early morning hours? I also like how in the original video for the post, the sheriff was asked what they are doing about the rampant car theft problems. Maybe he should have just showed this video and said \"You tell me. When they are raised with the mentality parents like these show, how do you think we're going to change any of that?\" ","Or parents that gave a damn.

When there's a clear bias in a narrative, they're not journalism. They reinforce ignorant and misinformed views to their audience.

Do you think the girl's mom who went on TV feels good about what happened? She feels like shit. Her daughter did something stupid and now she's dead. She probably wishes she could have stopped her daughter somehow. How do you think the mom would feel to go on the internet and see everyone blaming her for her 15 year old dead daughter's actions?","Dude these are 14 and 15 year olds who had a combined record of 7 auto thefts and who knows how many prior arrests, they are not children who have simply \"gotten out of hand.\" I understand the mothers plight, she's lost her daughter, but when these scenarios are reported the family always acts surprised that their child with multiple prior arrests for a multitude of offenses ends up in the grave or imprisoned for an extended period of time. \n\nI give them the benefit of the doubt until I can look more into the situation and what information is given, parents aren't always to blame but at some point you have to ask yourself how girls who have just reached their teenage years end up being car-jackers who flee from the cops and end up drowning themselves. Then you have to ask yourself why all the outrage is aimed at the police doing whatever they can with extremely limited time and equipment with horrendous conditions for any sort of diving operation, a superbly informal one mind you, rather than at the car-jacking kids and their parents who only come out of the woodworks once their kids fuck up.\n\nAnd quite frankly the way the mother feels about what the internet says doesn't matter, she wants to go on TV talking about \"getting to the bottom of this\" and \"getting answers\" meanwhile she won't recognize her daughters a carjacker who caused her own death, so there's going to be some semblance of flack coming her way.  ","Blaming parents is just dumb. You're either making someone who really tried feel like shit for failing at the worst moment of their life, or you're yelling at someone who's not going to care instead of doing something yourself.

I mean blaming cops is just as pointless and we're doing both out of reflex, I just missed most of the cop blaming and showed up for the parent blaming.","Yeah you're right man, we should let the bad parents go on television and spew their bull shit rhetoric when their children are the ones at fault, who have committed some sort of offense, who have made the mistakes. I'm not talking about the mother of your ex girlfriend, I'm talking about the mother of a multiple-time teenage car-jacker who acts like it's the sheriff departments fault for her child stealing a car with her friends, fleeing from the police, and crashing it leading it to their deaths. I'm talking about the mother of an 18 year old who strong arm robs a store, fights a cop, tries to take a gun, gets shot for it, and the mothers only response is to stand by the side of her 2nd husband calling for the destruction of their city and the punishment of the people who weren't as blinded by love towards an offender as she was. I'm talking about the mom of a child who walks around a park square with an airsoft gun painted all black pointing it at strangers acting surprised her child gets shot by an overzealous police officer. I'm talking about the mother of a bloods gang leader who says her son who had barricaded himself in his apartment shouldn't have been shot by the police after he stormed out, brandishing his guns, because he \"wasn't doing no gang shit at the time.\" \n\nI'm not denying the segment of your argument that good parents make bad and good kids and vice versa, I am not so ignorant to be blind to this, but every single time a young offender does something incredibly dangerous, illegal, and stupid we act like the mother is some saint who should be heard no matter the situation. We have to listen to blatantly bad people in numerous occasions talk about how they are hurt that their child who was convicted for a vast multitude of offenses and got shot at some obscene hour of the night is this perfect, lovely person, \"walking with Jesus\" as one pastor praised Michael Brown for doing, who was just at a bad several years of their life.\n\nI don't offer this as a solution to all the woes that are intrinsically linked to criminality as it is in no way that simple, and it's understandable for family to grieve, but the moment you put yourself out there in the public sphere and complain like these parents do you're going to get some semblance of criticism. ","These girls had a combined 63 arrests in 18 months. That means that at least one of those girls was arrested 3.5 times a month. That's more then once per month per person!!!!! Her daughter is 15.

Is it because of mental illness, a toxic environment that was entirely unknown to the parent no matter what good will they had to put their children in the best environment possible, is it because of a good parent having to deal with a kid who's mental and emotional states where somehow totally alien to the parent? Off all possibilities in the world, I'm willing to imagine and accept that it is indeed a possibility.\n\nThe question then is, is it the case in *this* case? Did it happened 2 years ago, will it happen in 3 years, does it happens once in humans history, once every year, once every month? \n\nThe answer is that we don't know, and **that's** why benefice of the the doubt is important.

You can't do it.","This was his last comment on it (two days ago) as his latest stance on it. \n\n\"Rescinding The Statements In My Daily Pennsylvanian Article\n\nIn TYT Blog by Cenk Uygur April 22, 2016.\n\nToday, I rescind the statements I made in my Daily Pennsylvanian article from 1991 entitled, ‚ÄúHistorical Fact of Falsehood? When I wrote that piece, I was a 21 year-old kid, who had a lot of opinions that I have since changed. Back then I had many political positions that were not well researched. For example, back in those days I held a pro-war rally for the Persian Gulf War. Anyone who knows me now knows that I am a very different person today.\nI also rescind the statements I made in a letter to the editor I wrote in 1999 on the same issue. Back then I had a very different perspective and there were many things that I did not give due weight. On this issue, I should have been far, far more respectful of so many people who had lost family members. Their pain is heart-wrenching and should be acknowledged by all.\nMy mistake at the time was confusing myself for a scholar of history, which I most certainly am not. I don‚Äôt want to make the same mistake again, so I am going to refrain from commenting on the topic of the Armenian Genocide, which I do not know nearly enough about.\nThank you for being patient with me on this issue, though I might not have always merited it.\"","Not a video, is it?  Let's see him say it on video.\n\nHe won't do it, even though he should.  He is too prideful.  Fucking scum.","Why does the way in which he rescinded his statement matter?  It sounds like you're just putting the goalposts out of reach to further your bias against him.\n\nKeep in mind I'm not a fan of Cenk's, and I believe the genocide did happen.  I just find it curious that even though there's evidence that he repudiated his statement(s), your only response is \"there's no video\".","I didn't even put any other information on it. I likely copied and pasted the latest information and got a downvote. ","No he probably wouldn't as he doesn't want to say it, I was just supplying the most relevant latest piece of information.  \n\nHe doesn't want to say it probably because he still wants to travel to Turkey and/or his family lives in Turkey.","&gt; No he probably wouldn't as he doesn't want to say it\n\nRight, that's my point.  If he genuinely believes that it was genocide, then he should be *so ashamed* of his past denial that he would be *eager* to correct himself on video.\n\nI accept no excuse.  *Particularly* not *\"Turkey denies it, so I won't say it happened\"*.  I don't think that is an ethically defensible position.  The reason Turkey gets away with Armenian genocide denial is because of the combined influence of people like Cenk who are willing to go along with it to avoid being inconvenienced.","There is an article on /r/all right now explaining how Turkey just put a journalist in jail for saying something bad about Erdogan. Saying the genocide happened is illegal in Turkey and might actually cause some trouble for him or his family living there since the country isnt exactly great with journalists not doing what they like. Not saying its 100% why he did not go further but its worth keeping in mind","I do not accept his desire to travel to Turkey as an excuse for Armenian Genocide Denial.\n\nIf his family is in danger, they should apply for asylum.  If their case is legitimate, there are plenty of European countries that seem eager to accept Muslim asylum seekers.\n\nThe real reason that Cenk doesn't make a video about the Armenian Genocide is because he is too prideful to admit Turkish fault like that.  Fuck him.","But since he only deneid the genocide in writing it shouldnt count either? I know of no video with Cenk denying it so by your standards it should not matter that he wrote those things back in the day?","Considering he runs a video channel named *The Young Turks*, I think a video statement is *more* than warranted.\n\nWhy are you defending this man?

The News wasn't a source of ratings or ad revenue.  \n\nThe News was service rendered for the use of public airwaves by the networks for the broadcast of their own content.

And they've done so in the same private interests that drive the same divisive issues in such a manner that allows the incremental erosion of civil liberties that are inherent in any free society: self-defense, bodily autonomy, privacy, freedom of speech, separation of church and state, right to due process, freedom from tyranny, and equal representation in government. \n\nThis clip is the creation one Law Enforcement professional's exasperation with that paradigm.

If the diver said it's too dangerous, the other cops would likely follow his lead.)\n\nThe problem is people only have access to these sorts of situations through TV and the movies. Many people have gained a false sense of ease about these things. This is reinforced by the fact that they rarely hear about rescuers in danger. (This is actually a testament to the guidelines for rescues. Yet, even still, if you actually speak with professional rescuers, they all will have close call and horror stories to tell.) Couple this with the modern American political trend of accepting uninformed rhetoric, and you have a recipe for people raging on police officers who did everything right.","&gt; This is reinforced by the fact that they rarely hear about rescuers in danger.

They still deserve to be called dumbasses.  Here's why:\n\nNo, they don't know what they're talking about, the technical stuff about water rescue.  Like you said, they don't have a clue.  But here's the catch: what they *do* know, is that they don't have a clue.  They know, or ought to know, *that they don't know*.  They ought to know better than to immediately start judging and criticizing the situation, because they know (or ought to) that they don't have the necessary information in order to properly do so.\n\nThat, we definitely can blame them for.

Every rebuttal he had provided information he felt the questioner was missing, he believed facts were being ignored, purposefully or negligently, that he pointed out.\n\nAny decent journalist by standards before social media would have been laughed out of the fucking room by both speaker and colleagues alike. Evidence to support your questions used to be a prerequisite to being an actual journalist.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the speaker 'laying into them' it has to do with the deterioration of the media. Click bait, strong statements, and ultimatums are what get attention, (what get to the front page of reddit), and are WHAT SELL.\n\nThis dude managed to stay PC while telling the room (specifically that questioner) that they're full of shit. On multiple sequential questions. That isn't putting them in their place, that's calling them out on their bullshit.

These journalists had a purpose, and they asked questions that would either support their claims or be dismissed as not answering the question.\n\nTHE FIRST RULE OF ANYBODY ASKING A QUESTION THAT SEEKS THE TRUTH IS TO MAKE IT UNBIASED. This is from statistics, journalism, and anything else that tries to get information from interviews that isn't to tell their own story. I straight up would have told this bitch, \"rather than creating quotes to support the article you've already written, how bout you try to uncover the ACTUAL truth, rather than your first perceived truth, and write a story about the actual situation. You are the worst kind of human being, rather than admitting you might not be capable of being a journalist, you twisted journalism to support you.\" And in a less PC required format I'd tell them to leave journalism, kill themselves, or at the very least go fuck themself.\n\nI acknowledge that officials in power fucked things up and tried to hide them, but I also realize that the media has misconstrued so many things it's become a PR battle rather than uncovering the truth.\n\nThis has more to do with YOU than anybody else. Everytime you click an article you consider 'click-bait', any time you don't think about the bias of an article written that has real life consequences, ANY instance of deciding the truth from a singular or a few sources, while ignoring the overwhelming majority opinion, makes you a culprit.\n\nBecause the media has found bigger profits in providing controversy rather than the truth, they've adopted the creation of controversy in otherwise benign situations.\n\nThis is someone keeping a PC tone to a situation that would have anybody average screaming, cursing, and threatening the inquisitor. This isn't laying into shit, IT'S CALLING THEM OUT ON THEIR BULLSHIT.\n\nSeriously, give me the most mundane of circumstances and I can create a sensationalist headline from it. Consider that a challenge, if you think you can create something I can't sensationalize within 72 hours that doesn't include someone under the age of 5, and I can spin it into something more tolerable.\n\nThis is just pure shit journalism, rather than 'laying into the media'. It's just calling someone out on their bullshit.","&gt; Seriously, give me the most mundane of circumstances and I can create a sensationalist headline from it.\n\nChallenge accepted.

The cops couldn't get to the car. Video evidence makes no difference here. They stole the car and got themselves killed, it's tragic but it's not the cops fault. To me, arguing that the cops didn't put in enough effort to save them is useless, because after looking at pictures of the pond, and growing up in Florida around similar ponds, I would be amazed if *anyone*, even with a bunch of gear and training, could have saved them before they drowned. ","That's not what we're talking about.  That's not what this press conference was about and that's not what the journalists were talking about. \n\nThe question at hand is whether the sheriff lied about his officers jumping into the swamp to try to save them.  The current video evidence seems to show that he lied. He says that's incorrect.  So let's see the video evidence of what he was saying.  it has to exist.","I honestly can't tell if you are under educated or just proper dumb.\n\n\nList of things that never happened because there is no video footage proving it.\n\nThe Great Pyramids, Evolution, Mammoths, the first olympics.\n\nYour logic is non existent and police are there to help, why would they just let them drown if they thought they could help? What kind of a monster would do that? You are seriously fucked in the head if you believe that they let those girls die and the parents are just upset because they lost their children, they will blame anyone but their kids. I can't believe I'm even replying to your insolent rhetoric but I just have to test the mettle of Reddit trolls like you, now I'll let you babble some bullshit about how police reports dont count as fact and only video does and I won't reply to it because your so full of shit it actually has infected your brain and ability to convey meaningful opinion\n\n","You and I are from two very different places.  We have access to the same information, but are looking at the story from two different perspectives.  To me, intelligence comes from appreciating and understanding all perspectives and possibilities before making a decision.\n\nI'm not saying the sheriff is lying, but I'm certainly don't have any reason to implicitly trust him when he's doing PR for his department.\n\nHere's the rub.  This is what he said before:\n\n&gt; \"They tried to get in there and rescue those girls, and they just couldn't do it,\" Gualtieri said.\n\n&gt; It is against department policy to actively pursue a nonviolent offender, he said.\n\nThat's a GREAT policy that many departments do not have.  So my question is- why did they adopt this policy?  There must have been some sort of public backlash to the police causing dangerous situations in order to adopt this policy of not actively chasing non-violent offenders.  Let's do some due diligence and see:\n\nhttp://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/pinellas-sheriff-toughens-pursuit-policy/2170549\n\nOk, so we're correct.  The Sheriff instituted the new policy because there was an uptick in unjustified chases.  The new policy specifically prohibits the department from chasing stolen vehicles.\n\nNow, it's difficult to find the full video, but in the released pursuit video, you can clearly see police pursuing the girls in the stolen car WITH red and blue lights on.  This is a major inconsistency in the story.  Whether or not you take issue with blaming the police for this, it is a clear violation of the police policy and an inconsistency in the Sheriff's story.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R78KzEY74Ok\n\nSo then the other consistency question is whether or not he told the truth about police trying to save the girls from the water- entering the water and not being able to get further than 15 yards out due to mud... DID they really TRY to go in the water and save the girls.  The video evidence leans the other direction.  There IS a video of two officers in undergarments with belts off.  But they don't look wet.  I'm not saying it's in their job description, I'm asking if there is evidence to the PR narrative that they entered the water and attempted to save the girls.\n\nhttp://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/pinellas-sheriff-toughens-pursuit-policy/2170549\n\nThere's another inconsistency in the official story, but I'm not going to get into that at this point because I think it would rub you the wrong way.","Okay, I will admit that you have got them on the Do Not Chase clause, hiwever I would suggest their are so many caveats on a standing DNC that it may aswell not exist, in so far as the cops probably always make it become a reason to chase legally. I'm not saying that is the right way to do things but institutions take time to change policy and full adopt it. Although I will admit I'm playing Devil's advocate.\n\nThe main issue I have with your rhetoric is that you are witch hunting. You say you havent made a decision until you have all facts however you have been obviously biased against the police in question the whole time. Your need for video evidence is, quite frankly, absolutely preposterous. We have lived in a world where video evidence has only been common in the last 20 years but you are demanding it as if it is your right when it may not even exist. \n\nThe other fact I think your missing is that this was a high intensity situation where people react before thinking. Often it is very difficult to recall the exact actions taken during duress periods, this can lead to misinformation down the line. I have no doubt these officers did everything they could do once that car was in the pond, however now that you have brought to light the DNC policy in place I have my overall concerns about how the sheriff defended the claims so vigorously, I can only imagine he is either getting on the front foot so they (wider media) dont find this out or is completely vindicated in their reason for pursuit.\n\nI would respect the way in which you made your allegations more though if you didnt do it in such a disparaging manner. It weakens your argument and shows emotion instead of intelligence which has it's place but I dont think it's helpful here.\n\n","&gt; there are so many caveats on a standing DNC that it may aswell not exist\n\nsure- and it's a policy rather than an actual law.  there's clearly going to be selective enforcement and justification for \"breaking\" policy.  But that's precisely where this sheriff is forced to do PR.  And he's always going to defend his guys until there is a blatant and egregious violation (which I'm not saying this is).\n\nI'm playing devils advocate here and I'm reacting to a reaction.  \n\n&gt; The main issue I have with your rhetoric is that you are witch hunting. You say you havent made a decision until you have all facts however you have been obviously biased against the police in question the whole time\n\nYes.  I will always be biased against the word of police.  BUT it's not just that that I'm reacting to.  It's that people here are taking a PR person at his word.  I'm saying that this guy shouldn't be taken at his word because considering his position as an authority and defacto PR person, his word shouldn't be worth a whole lot.\n\n&gt; Your need for video evidence is, quite frankly, absolutely preposterous.\n\nDon't strawman my position into thinking that I'm saying nothing can be proven without video evidence.  I'm making two specific points about video evidence here.\n\n1.) There is squadcar video.  My point is that there would be a squadcar pointed directly into the pond where the girls went in.  They were following close and would have used the headlights to illuminate the entry.  We know that squadcar has video.  So show us THAT video, not some edits in a press package he put together.\n\n2.) This press event was his PR after news picked up video of his guys wandering around on shore.  He claims this is misrepresented and then highlights a video of his guys walking around without their belts on.  That's been misrepresented in this thread already:\n\n&gt; He also states that in the other videos that you will see officers, with there gun belts off, and their clothing off **out in the water assessing the area**.\n\nThis just isn't true.  And my bias doesn't matter because the video evidence here doesn't indicate that they're muddy or wet.  I think it's very likely that they did not enter the water as was reported.\n\n&gt; I have no doubt these officers did everything they could do once that car was in the pond\n\nWHY don't you have doubt?  Does that suggest bias on your part.  My philosophy is to doubt PR.  Cops do not generally consider themselves emergency response/ rescue.  Why would you assume that they would put themselves at ANY risk to save people from a trapped car.  Of course there are police that have done so or would do so, but these girls were \"criminals\".  Why would you assume that the police would \"do everything possible\" to save them?\n\n&gt; I would respect the way in which you made your allegations more though if you didnt do it in such a disparaging manner. It weakens your argument and shows emotion instead of intelligence which has it's place but I dont think it's helpful here.\n\nThe logic of my argument isn't what you're reacting to, so don't say that my method indicates a lack of intelligence. It's contradictory.  I appreciate the thought put into your response and the time you've taken to address my points, but the concept of an emotional response doesn't make my point less valid.  The reaction to my response has placed emotion and bias over the logic and factual analysis.","Show us actual evidence that they did not get in the water.

Plenty of those are fun-facts-style posts that some Redditor went to the bother of putting together, and some \"journalist\" went to the bother of copying and pasting and editing a couple of words to stick it onto their own website","What the Hell is the backstory??","There are definitely a lot of bad cops out there, but at the same time it is crazy that there are good cops that have to deal with this type of crap. This is bad for the good cops and the people they try to protect. I find it remarkably similar to how false rape accusations lead to fewer victims coming forward. ","I don't see what this has to do with good/bad cops.  It's more of the media always jumping to conclusions and placing inaccurate blame, whatever sells/get's viewers.","I'm not sure what the liability laws are here, but if reporters knowingly promulgated false information with malicious intent, then that's slander and/or libel.  Seems that if a few media outlets got sued and had to pay out a cash settlement, there might be better reporting in the future.  ","In my analogy the bad side of the media was suppose to represent people who make false rape accusations. I mention the good/bad cop things because I still want the media to identify when there are bad cops just like how rape victims should still come forward and identify their attackers.  ","I find it remarkable how women who falsely accuse men of raping them aren't convicted to the fullest extent of the law.","because many actual rape victims will lie and say they made it up because of abuse or fear or just plain old exaustion with the legal system. and many of the \"false\" rape stats include cases where there just wasnt enough evidence, even though the victim wasmt lying. \n\nprosecuting every woman who takes back her accusation or cant prove it will only prevent more victims from coming forward. ","Nothing you said is an excuse not to prosecute women to the fullest when their rape claims are false. Being falsely accused of rape can and has ruined careers and lives, just because they are men doesn't make them less worthy of defending. If you lie you should be held accountable. A false rape accusation will still follow the falsely accused around the rest of their lives.","To be fair, this is what happens when good cops look the other way and let dirty cops lie in their reports. \n\nEveryone's actions come into question, and written reports don't mean shit. It DOES become \"if it's not on video it didnt happen\" unfortunately.","I don't know if that's so true anymore. One time yes, but since social media has taken over I rarely see any story without plenty of counter-arguments against whatever stance the journalist has taken. Social media has allowed contrarians a voice everywhere, and sometimes that's a good thing. \n\nI think the issue is more to do with the mass bombardment of news that we have now instead of reading a daily paper in the morning and maybe watching the 6 o'clock news at night. There's information overload. And when this is coupled with the shorter attention spans, there's only so many stories we can dig deeper on to find out what actually is happening. We let our confirmation biases (seeking out what we want to hear or read) along with the top comment on the article/thread/post define our stances, and that's about as much of a concise overview we take on all stories that we don't have the time+motivation to dig deeper into. ","To be fair, that site is not really a reputable source of information.","Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.","The girls had 7 instances of stealing cars before that.\n\nI can't believe i'm saying this, but looking at their pictures in a comment below ,those kids were clearly raised in the ghetto , which explains a lot, such as their tendency towards crime at young age, and their instinct to run from authority.\n\nProblems like this will continue, including the videos of police ~~\"Brutality\"~~ misusing their power, while people continue to disrespect the police force. Resisting arrest does not make you look innocent, Shouting at a police officer does not solve the problem, be calm, be nice, and no more problems continue.\n\nPut it this way, if you don't give the good or bad officers a reason to shoot you, you're all good.\n\nCall it racism, Call it discrimination, Call it whatever bullshit you want, I've never seen a ~~black person~~ anyone get shot/killed by the police for being a model citizen.","&gt;  I've never seen a black person get shot/killed by the police for being respectful.\n\n[there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUyDY9YBiDQ), fixed that for you","Holy shit that was horrifying","Yeah that was a pretty bad one.   That cop was messed up in the head from a previous incident and had no business being on the road.   Fortunately his aim sucked and he only hit the guy once and it was a non life threatening wound.  The trooper was also immediately arrested, charged, and is awaiting trial.","He seriously looked like he was getting his gun out","What the fuck? He literally just reached into his car. How else was he supposed to grab his license? ","By not looking like he was getting a gun out. i.e. politely asking the officer if he can get it out for him or sitting down first.\n\nWithout any context, you would think he was ready to glock the officers.\n\nThe guy isn't the wrong, he just made a mistake \n","That's called being dumb(and quite unfortunate).   Don't reach for shit out of sight when you have a gun pointed at you.","Yeah he also shouldn't have been black, same thing goes for girls who get raped. They're all just asking for it.","It's not about his skin colour, he could have easily been trying to get a gun out.","Thank you for using logic.","No the trooper was 100% in the wrong here.   The stop was for a seatbelt violation.  There was nothing else to it.   I'm a cop, people reach for stuff all the time and generally act stupid when blue lights are on them.  You come to expect it and have to make split second decisions about the character of the person you are dealing with.   \n\n\nLike I've said earlier that trooper had some previous issues and had no business being on the road.   However there is zero psychological or emotional support available for law enforcement, workers comp doesn't cover psychological trauma, and for some reason victim's rights laws aren't applied to law enforcement even though there's nothing in the law that says they should not be.\n\nBasically if I'm a victim of an assault, attempted murder, etc. while on duty I pretty much have to suck it up and deal with it and go to the next call.  Its no surprise you get cops that are suffering what is very temporary and treatable post-traumatic anxiety overreacting and we end up with videos like this.","Fair enough.\n\nI wasn't tying to offend anybody and he very well could be in the wrong here. It was more meant as a general comment that if a cop has his gun drawn you shouldnt grab for something","Just because you're raised in the ghetto doesn't mean you shouldn't apply common sense.","Exactly, but people in the ghetto are A) less educated and B) Desperate","|common sense. \n\nA 8 year old has it.

Why weren't they thrown into a controlled environment and their freedom taken away?  \"Oh, no, we can't do that...\" is what the bleeding hearts then say, and then tomorrow Jamal eggs on two others to go out with him to sow chaos and they ruin the life of Abigail and Brett who were out on a study date with a bright and prosperous future in front of them, and we say \"well, nothing can be done, its a tragedy, another statistic.\"  \n\nWhen so called \"kids\" don't act like kids, don't treat them like kids.  Throw them in juvi, teach them to respect authority, force them to learn a trade, and then when they show they are willing to behave like contributing members of society release them with ankle bracelets and close supervision.   The cost of housing them is far less than the cost of cleaning up after them.","Prison does not straighten kids out. Neither method of letting them free nor locking them in a prison, right now, would help the community or the kids. That is why we need to come up with a better solution that teaches these kids trades while being heavily supervised. I'm not sure if the solution is education in prisons, bootcamp, or heavy surveillance. Just something needs to change because right now we either ruin a kids life with prison or charge money and let them free.","&gt; Prison does not straighten kids out.\n\nAt a bare minimum, it protects all the good kids in the community from them.   Right now what they are taught is that they can do whatever they want, and there's really no repercussions.   If they hadn't inadvertently crashed into a lake, they would still be assaulting people, mugging, stealing, selling drugs at school, and so forth.   From my own personal experience, kids that grow up without boundaries and immediate repercussions for unacceptable behavior are the toxic ones, so at least you remove the problem and set an example for others to see that there's no tolerance anymore.  ","The ones that don't have any knowledge of being a good kid will not be a good adult. This means when they are released they will commit crimes again. Our current system locks up kids like you are saying all the time and all we get out of it is paying for someone to be in prison their entire life. They will never see what real life is like in prison and will have no skills for work. On top of that companies will see \"convict\" and immediately not hire them. We need to rethink why if we as a country are so great that we lock up the most people in the WORLD. \n\nMy point is to not let them free, but to rethink how we discipline them. To many kids, school is as tough as prison while prison is  easy. ","[removed]","That one article you are basing UK on is false.

They do have 1/4th the murder rate. \n\nAlso I am NOT arguing that locking people up doesn't create less crime. I am arguing that it is not the best method. I am arguing that it does not FIX the situation and creates more costs for when they get out. We end up spending [around $66 billion](http://money.cnn.com/infographic/economy/education-vs-prison-costs/) on [prisoners each year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States). That to me is stupid. \n\n&gt;\"Well under 1%\"? \n\nThat is 1 out of 100 people are not contributing to society at any given time due to prison. \n\nAlso you are going way off the topic with illegal immigration but you have misinformation about illegal immigration.

I clearly state an option of locking them up but providing education.","Your sources are from far left wing outlets, of course they are going to say you can't compare the numbers, and ignore the fact that every year the US violent crime rate is lower than the year before.   \n\nWhen your article refers to illegal aliens as **\"undocumented immigrants\"** (what kind of nonsense is that), that should be a red flag that you're reading nonsense propaganda.   \n\nThe crime rate for legal hispanics is already higher than the national average, and while the US government refuses to collect statistics on illegal alien crime, considering most have very little education and are those that come in ilegally are not the best that Mexico has to offer (the reason they weren't granted legal entry to begin with), it is reasonable to show it is at least as high as legal hispanics with evidence showing it is much higher by collecting the local jurisdiction statistics we do have to estimate a national total: http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/09/16/crime-wave-elusive-data-shows-frightening-toll-illegal-immigrant-criminals.html\n\nThus, there is no way to argue that the violent crime rate would not be reduced by enforcing immigration, and you forget that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and aren't calculating the tremendous costs to society compared to incarceration or deportation. ","Nice dodging but the original question was not about illegal immigration. Also it doesn't sound like you know how hard it is to get citizenship. ","What topic was dodged?   My argument is that European countries are seeing consistently increasing violent crime rates, while we see a steady downward sloping violent crime rate thanks to incarceration, and we need to do the same for seriously toxic younger people (in juvi) and not allow them to commit nine felonies in just as many months.   That is ridiculous!    I went on further to argue that we should enforce immigration law which will reduce the violent crime rate, and showed supporting evidence for that opinion.

In some schools (poor urban ones) there's not enough time of the day. I don't think the problem can be blamed on how we discipline the children, it should be mostly blamed on the culture they are raised in. Children in these communities are not taught to respect authority figures like principles or teachers.

The engineer makes the cheapest possible product and the doctor prescribes the most profitable drug.

There even seemed to be the odd tongue in cheek jokes about the old movies too, like the reveal of the \"invisible car\" that isn't actually invisible it's just not parked there.","I thought the gadgets were one of the best parts ","Would be interesting to see where the Bond movies would have gone without the Bourne movies. Maybe even goofier and crazy seeing how popular Superhero movies became shortly after, and in the broadest sense Bond is kind of a superhero, at least compared to someone like Hawkeye.","I think they are starting to regress already, Spectre had quite a few moments reminiscent of the older movies ie. camera pan away for seconds and suddenly in a tux.

But they are well known for upping the ante and making it happen regardless of what the myth is based on. They had 2 chances to make it happen. The fuckin president asked them to make it happen. I'm wary of this gif, though. I put my word on mythbusters; I don't seem them as the half assing type. \n\nHowever, this appears to be a flat wall of mirrors and a concave wall of mirrors reflecting off one another. Not just a beam you could aim at a target, like they were testing. They generate more heat reflecting of each other than just a singular beam, maybe? I'm not qualified to speak on any of this kind of shit.\n\nPerhaps /u/mistersavage could chime in?","Aiming a beam is a funny thing. If you have to hit a moving target that could be anyway, then you'd never do it with a massive array like this. \n\nBut, if you have say, a narrow approach into a bay or a harbor, and can predict with certainty where you need to aim, then suddenly it's not so hard. ","Like others said, the test was about history. Clearly if you have a large enough mirror\\*, and a good enough tracking and optics you can reach any temperature.

Probably easier to just make a trebuchet.\n\nEdit: using only mirrors turns out you can only get to the temperature of the sun (6000K)","&gt;  Clearly if you have a large enough mirror, and a good enough tracking and optics you can reach any temperature\n\nTechnically the highest temperature you could reach is the same as the temperature of the thing you're focusing from. Neat XKCD article on that [here](http://what-if.xkcd.com/145/).","I don't think that's true. The theoretical maximum should simply be a function of the power of light and the power dissipation of the object you're reaching. For a radiative cooled object, that's something like T = k \\* P^1/4 , and since the power P is proportional to the collecting area A, T &lt;= k \\* A^1/4 (you can choose A to be as large as you want). The real limitation is the power of the sun in this case.\n\nThere are many other limits too (quantum effects, general relativity, yadda yadda), you've got to stop somewhere :)","I highly recommend reading through the article I linked. ","Ah right mirrors are passive. Cool article! \n\nYou actually can do it if you extend your definition of mirrors and allow them to be inefficient. For example, suppose instead of mirrors you used solar panels to collect the power, and then lasers to concentrate light. Clearly then you can reach any temperature. \n\nSo the conclusion of \"you can't start a fire with moonlight\" is ultimately false, it should be \"you can't use passive lossless elements to reach a steady state temperature greater than the source\". You are also able to temporarily raise the temperature (and thus start a fire) with completely passive lossless elements (optics, mirrors, etc) by \"storing\" light in a ressonator and then releasing it; the second law is violated if you reach a steady state temperature higher than the source with no losses, which isn't necessarily the case.\n\nEdit: You might also be able to simply coat the mirrors with some band-pass material. Then you can make your spectrum identical to a laser, and thus achieve any temperature with enough power.","I don't know anyone that would extend their definition of \"mirrors\" to what you're suggesting. The subject of the article, and of this particular comment thread was refracted/reflected light.","See my edit. I thought about it, and simply a coated mirror should do it. That's a valid mirror for me!","But wouldn't the object you're reflecting on melt before the target object is reached?","They weren't using enough science.

","Well Jaime did feel warmth on the boat when hey upped the ante, but the core thing is Archimede's death ray, they wanted to see if people could do it, a moving object etc, where as this is just a device intended to do one specific thing, focus light. It's sort of comparing apples and oranges, their myth had a framework they had to stick to, this didn't.","Well one time they were testing a myth that a part of a car got ripped out because as the car was driving, a piece of the undercarriage was hanging and snagged in a pothole, causing the part of the car to get yanked out.\n\nSo Mythbusters set up similar conditions. They had a pothole lined up with a piece of the undercarriage hanging low enough to hook it.\n\nBut they only tried a few times and when they weren't lucky enough to pull it off, they called the myth busted I think.\n\nI was like \"... or keep trying, because this is totally plausible and you just haven't nailed it yet...\"\n\nSo I love Mythbusters but take them with a big grain of salt.","The myth was the car **polevaulting** due to the driveshaft hitting the pothole.\n\nAnd they *did* manage to hit it but since driveshafts are rigid and cars very heavy they just ended up wrecking the car.

","It's steel.   \nThere are non photovoltaics solar plants, where you use big mirrors to make steam to make turbines spin. I don't know how it does in comparison to photovoltaics though.","Thanks. ","The efficiency of a photovoltaic panel is around 25%. The efficiency of a thermal solar plant is up to 41%. While efficiency isn't the main goal of solar power, since sunlight is free, it is important for land use and material cost.\n\nThe main drawback of thermal solar is that it's more complicated, the tolerances are much smaller and it can't be effectively scaled down. While a photovoltaic panel could be off by a lot, even 20 degrees and not be affected much, a large parabolic collector being off by even 1 degree would miss the target completely and be useless, perhaps even dangerous. \n\nThat's why you don't see many thermal solar things on the roofs of houses, you couldn't trust a tech to get it right, or the homeowner to maintain them, and the mirrors won't be big enough to get the temperature high enough for a generator to be effective.","youtube has subtitles and auto translate in the options.

John, in a bit of an overreaction, recorded the song \"How Do You Sleep?\" Basically, he called him a cunt and accused him of stealing the song Yesterday. And to add fuel too that fire, John also had George Harrison and Klaus Voorman (longtime friend) play on the song. This seems really out of character for George to me. He never seemed to get into petty shit like that, despite the emotions he was probably feeling after all the years of being overshadowed by John/Paul. \n\nOn the other hand, Ringo was apparently also at the session, and called John out on his shit. \"That's enough, John\".

","Innes is another link between Pythons and Beatles. He appears in Holy Grail as Sir Robin's squire who sings \"Brave Sir Robin\". Also George Harrison was in RWT singing Urban Spaceman (an Innes song, the single produced by Paul McCartney) and Innes was in the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band who perform (with stripper) in the Magical Mystery Tour movie, and were also regulars in Do Not Adjust Your Set, the kid's show that featured Palin, Jones and Idle.\n\nOh, and Ringo appears very briefly in series 3 (I think) of the Python TV show.\n\nEDIT: John Lennon had a only quite tenuous links: he appeared in Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's sketch show, and they were the originators of the U.K. 1960s \"satire boom\" that also produced David Frost, for whom the Pythons did a lot of writing. And they were all fans of The Goons, Milligan appearing in Life of Brian, and who did a comedy record (produced by George Martin) called Purple Aeroplane (a spoof of Yellow Submarine).","The story of Milligan ending up in Life of Brian is a funny one. He was in the area filming a completely separate movie and just showed up on their set uninvited, but obviously welcome.

Terry Jones, maybe? Or possibly it was Michael Palin. I can't quite recall. Regardless, Idle and Innes go back prior to Python. I don't believe Innes was ever given a writing credit, though.\n\nFun fact: As far as I'm aware, the only non-Python to get a writing credit on the show was Douglas Adams. Yes, _that_ Douglas Adams. He also appeared on screen in a sketch near the end of the show's run, though as a I recall most his face was covered by a surgical mask. [Link if interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPFQxXxDv6k) As is common for Python, the primary writer appears in the sketch. Adams is in the sketch because he wrote it. (I'm at work on a machine with no sound, hopefully the audio is in English. I notice there's subtitles.)\n\n*Edit: It was annoying me so I checked, as it turns out, Idle was on the show with both Jones and Palin.*","I do a variation of \"We found this spoon\" whenever I find something in a pocket or drawer... or just for kicks.

He literally will not sign anything if you ask him or take a picture.","Probably doesn't want people hounding him for a signature so they can turn around and try to sell it on the internet to some schmuck. The picture part idk","So. Is that really a big deal?  And Liverpool is a shit hole.","Does that make him a bad guy?","When your fans are the ones that made you famous, its a bit dickish to outright refuse doing something back for them. Even if the thing ypur doing is writing your own name on a piece of paper.","He's probably had millions of fans do that to him. From the fan's perspective, they finally met this man they've idolized forever. From his perspective, he just has tons of annoying random people coming up to him. It takes a lot to be nice to fans.","His music made him famous, not the fans. ","Implying that making music - or even good music, for that matter - will make you famous...\n\nIf you don't have a following (I.e. fans), you will not become famous. There are thousands of musicians who play good music that you or I have never heard of.","When I was 10, I used to take my lunch money and give it to this guy so he would play his dobro for me. He would buy a fifth of wine and play the best blues ever. My mom used to whoop me for doing this but seeing him drinking his wine without a care in the world kept me going back. He was the best damn picker to ever play the blues.\n\n","Sick refernce bro\nPLAY SOME SKYNRYD!!","On the other hand, it's not like the group of all potential fans got together and had a meeting and went \"hmmm, let's make this one famous this generation\".","No, but to say that the fans have nothing to do with becoming famous is ridiculous","People think Ringo was the least important Beatle? George is the one hardly anyone can remember. ","George had the best solo career tho","so true\n","I disagree, my favorite was Paul's. Band on the Run, Ram, Give my regards to Broadway, great albums","George had the first hits, post-Beatles, as well as the last number one hit among all of the former Beatles (\"I Got My Mind Set On You\" - 1988).  Plus he was in the Traveling Wilburys, who one might argue are better than Wings.","But Paul made Ram ^(and temporary secretary)","Ram was good but I prefer All Things Must Pass. Living in the Material World is great too and his other albums are good while I dont think Paul ever got close to Ram again. I dont like his work with Wings and Temporary Secretary is annoying.","I do like Paul better but I totally understand. All things must pass is awesome. However, George never made a disco single, unlike SOMEONE ","&gt; George never made a disco single\n\ndefinitely, definitely not a bad thing","Ringo is only remembered because he was the least important one. At the time, George was much more known.","Perfumed ponce\n\n(on which note, if any Sharpe fans haven't seen Withnail, that line is delivered by Sergeant Harper)","Fuck off, not wanting to talk to fans doesn't make him a \"fucking dick.\" He was one of the most famous people in the world for several years, it's not a surprise he's a little anti-social. \n\nRingo kept the Beatles together in several instances and I could make a large post explaining his value if anyone was interested","I'm definitely interested if you have the time...","Absolutely. Be warned, this is gonna be all over the place. \n\nNumber one: Ringo was a fantastic drummer and the idea that he was bad is laughable. He was the only Beatle that was \"hired,\" specifically because he was considered the best drummer in Liverpool. He had a massive influence on modern drumming as we know it, I would expound on this but my drum knowledge is very limited.\n\nHe was the glue of the band, both musically and personally (only beaten by maybe their manager, Brian.) He was a very non-partial figure in their personal disputes and a perfect time keeper in the studio.\n\nHe wasn't particularly flashy but his tempo was nearly perfect and it allowed the Beatles to use interesting production techniques like slicing together different takes seemlessly. The joke \"he's not even the best drummer in the Beatles\" is sometimes attributed to be about Pete *Best*, the original drummer.\n\nHe generally wrote all of his parts himself and didn't rely on help from the others. This independence freed up the other three to collaborate with each other and focus solely on the more \"musical\" side of the songs.\n\nDuring the tense recording of the white album, Ringo quit the band in fear he was part of the problem. When George Harrison quit the band, they simply waited for him to return and joked about replacing him with Eric Clapton.\nWhen Ringo quit the band? They sent him a telegram apologizing and saying they all loved him.\n\nWhen the Beatles split up, all four soon released solo albums. Ringo was the only one to have contributions from all four members, while people like George and John weren't on speaking terms.\n\nI love the Beatles, but the other three were all bigger jerks than Ringo at some point or another. \nObviously, John beat a woman or two. George slept with Ringo's wife and COMPLETELY wrote John out of his autobiography. Paul never did anything despicable but was very controlling and demanding in the studio, making the others record 20-30 of his songs before they would try a Harrison song. He allegedly re-recorded Ringo's drums on some songs and Ringo would pretend not to notice. This is part of why there was so much animosity between Paul and John.\n\nHe's been using his fame to promote peace for his entire career and AFAIK he's a bit of an activist/charity donor.\n\nTL;DR: Ringo was an influential metronome, a chill friend and wasn't too much of a jerk unlike the other Beatles sometimes were","I've never understood how someone could call a drummer unimportant. They set the tempo of an entire song, and if you have to replace them, your entire sound is liable to change. ","Drummers are the most underappreciated members of any given band, unless they're someone like John Bonham. As you said, they're largely the glue of a band and important to sound. And this is coming from a guitarist. ","Paul did play drums on a few Beatles songs but never re-recorded Ringo's parts.  That was because it was when Ringo had temporarily quit....or in the case of Ballad of John and Yoko, it was just John and Paul playing and no one else.","Paul didn't think Ringo did a well enough job on Back in the USSR","Ringo was the first ex-Beatle to have a hit song post breakup.\n","Ringo is my all time favorite drummer. A song drummer with flair.","I second that motion","i third it","I fifth it. ","feel like there should be a fourth here.","Well George Harrison Fucked Ringo's wife and ruined both of their marriages. So there's that.","Man, there was so much bullshit between all of the Beatles. ","Yeah, the guy hates his fans so much, he personally responded to everyone's fan mail all the way until fucking 2008. What a scumbag. ","Well, in his defense, Liverpool *is* a shithole.","Thomas? ","Yes. The tank engine. You should know him, being a real train and all.","Ringo was one of the conductors on the show. My favorite was George Carlin hands down.","\nI've never had a bad interaction with Ringo, FWIW. \n\nGeorge, on the other hand, loathed interacting with fans. Actually, people in general. The whole Beatlemania thing made him a very sullen person (not without good reason though)","He did get attacked by a crazed fan in 1999. In his own home, no less. He had his reasons to be paranoid.","Kind of an understatement, it was less an 'attack' and more 'attempted murder.' According to Wikipedia, he had a punctured lung and like forty stab wounds.","\nI won't hold that against him, but he was a prickly one even before that. ","Not to mention _The Point_.  I spent years seeking out a copy, and wouldn't have minded whether the narration was by Harry Nilsson or Dustin Hoffman ... but the copy I finally found is narrated by Ringo.  Just bollocks.","Wait who did Thomas the Tank engine voices other than him?  I thought he was a dick (when I'd grown up and listened to his nonsense) but at the time watching TtTE I had no idea.","Oddly enough, George Carlin did a couple.","more than a couple and Alec Baldwin narrated for a time as well","a UK version?","Thomas the tank engine is a British show exported to the US. Ringo Starr originally narrated the programme. After he left the programme was narrated in the US by George Carlin followed by Alec Baldwin and then Michael Brandon. Meanwhile in the UK after Starr left it was narrated by Michael Angelis. Now both versions are narrated by Mark Moraghan.","oh please","https://youtu.be/CeKWVuye1YE\n\nThe debate","Yay! Time Bandits, Withnail... classics! I always thought How to Get Ahead in Advertising was an overlooked gem...","But I would hardly say that Paul treated the others horribly because he put two lines in a song. Songwriting can be cathartic and I think he was using it as a way to vent. And compared to How Do You Sleep or even George's Not Guilty that was recorded for the White Album, Paul was very good about it all. Considering that the other three Beatles were all against him for not going along with Allen Klein and his best friend/songwriting partner more or less hated him, Paul was extremely considerate about the whole thing. ","I watch it at least once a year. Always enjoy it.","[The Rutles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA7bYjCbfX4) were better than the Beatles.  Seriously a close run thing.\n\nI think there may have been a bit of George in there somewhere...\n\nEdit: If this doesn't get a bazillion upvotes you're all wombats!","D Dr ","Moreover that's an awesome poster for the movie I've never seen before. Think I've only seen whatever is on the VHS cover. ","He done a teenage cancer trust gig a few years back. He mad all the shops on the street that sold meat shut down for the night, didnt allow any meat at all in the premises, refused to take pictures or even meet the kids with cancer, and never even signed anything to give them after the show.","Do you have a source for this? Nothing appears if you google it....\n\nPlus how and why would you think Paul McCartney had any say over what separate businesses do on a street? ","I saw that movie a few times, didn't recognize him, and even after I knew he was in the scene I didn't recognize him.","Im pretty sure it wasnt solely funded, considering emi already provided some funding and led zeppelin did as well.\n","And Pink Floyd (or so I'm told).","You're thinking of Holy Grail. ","So I am... Thanks for correcting me :)\n\nEdit: what're the downvotes for? ","Thanks! I was trying to remember the other party involved!!!!","EMI backed out","Really? I remember reading an article saying they still payed for alot of the initial costs by the time they left, ie travel and transport, logistical stuff. I could be wrong, its been a while haha. Though I do remember them saying Zeppelin and Floyd also contributed money as well, mainly john paul jones and nick mason, respectively. Again, dont have the source, it was either in Rolling Stone or MOJO/NME.","I recently watch the Living in the Material World documentary about George Harrison, and if I remember correctly, EMI initially funded the project, but soon backed out completely because of its satire on religion, which left Python in a pinch to get funding, which is why George stepped in and funded it. And I believe Led Zeppelin helped fund a different Python movie","Interesting, I havent seen that doc yet. Solid film? I cant even remember which magazine it was, so I will trust your recent source over mine haha. I thought that floyd and zep helped, but you may be right- perhaps it was for the Holy Grail and I am confusing the situations. either way- great musicians and two awesome movies all around.","It was probably the best doc I have ever watched. If you are a George fan, you will love it","Huge Harrison fan,  have just about his whole catalogue on vinyl. Thanks for the recommendation buddy, I'm amazed I haven't heard of it yet.  I'm not sure what other music you're into but I just watched \"Who is Harry Nilson?\" and I highly recommend it for fans of music docs. Depressing , but amazing.\n","Im actually a huge Harrison fan, and I just started collecting vinyl. So far I got a NM copy of Living in the Material World, Early Takes, and Greatest Hits. Im begging for Harrisons catalogue to be rereleased","Sweet man, enjoy the hobby, its a freaking riot. Strangely, Living in the Material world is one of the only ones I dont have. I lucked out and found original apple presses of the concert for bangladesh and All things must pass at a yard sale. Def start yard-saling, amazing place to find records.","*You've got red on you.*","So?","So he was definitely not the \"only down to Earth\" one. Pretty simple comment tbh.","To quote Harrison \"It's the most expensive movie ticket I ever bought\"","Don't forget Denis O'Brian . They distribute the film.  which means they throw money up front for profits at the front end. that means the rest get paid at the \"back end\" (net) while these guys base shares of gross profit.. a form of speculative take.    EMI would probably have no problem doing it today. but in the 70s and 80s the church networks would place them on a boycott list. ","They all were at some point or another.\n\nPlus from what Ive heard they all sort of stayed spiritual later on.","The best Beatle. (Incoming shitstorm, but FUGGIT)","He really was.

The album was released a year after John told the group privately he was leaving The Beatles.  And IIRC, there was one or two songs on the album that were written by Bob Dylan.  So yes, George was denied slots on several albums, but All Things Must Pass wasn't a big 'Fuck You' to John and Paul.","I don't think any Beatle released a record post-breakup that matches up to *Plastic Ono Band.*","I'd go as far as to say that half the Beatles actual albums don't match up to *Plastic Ono Band*.","Wouldn't disagree with that","It might not be entirely old Beatles tunes but it was still a pretty big triumph for Harrison. One of the songs, I think My Sweet Lord, became hugely popular at a time when Paul and John were releasing pretty much rubbish as their solo stuff. It was a pretty clear sign that Harrison was at least as talented a songwriter as the others despite them rarely giving him even the chance to prove it. But of course I'll get downvoted for this because John Lennon wrote Imagine bro","If we're talking pure pop wizardry, no GH did not match up to Lennon or McCartney. He was great at the vibey beautiful stuff but he couldn't have written a song like Instant Karma! or Isolation. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying every Beatles song was better than any given songs off ATMP, because I'd Have You Anytime shits on a song like Maxwell's Silver Hammer, but comparing a 28 song compendium to solo records written from scratch isn't a 1:1 proposition, imo. Even then, Plastic Ono Band is the best post-breakup solo album.","That's the thing, though, I'd take vibey beautiful stuff over pop wizardry any day. McCartney could write a belter of a tune but if you're looking for something with substance, you're out of luck for the most part (there are some exceptions, For No One for example). All I'm saying is, they marginalised Harrison for years and years, and post-breakup he proved he could stand at least shoulder to shoulder with them.","He's not shoulder-to-shoulder.

I'm a behavioral ecologist, so I guess I'll go in that direction. Here is one of my favorite comments I've made here before because I loved the animal the original post was about:\n\nMantis shrimp are one of my favorite animals! They are also neither shrimp nor mantis. They are a crustacean of the order *[Stomatopoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp)*. Shrimp is sort of an umbrella term, but most are under order [*Decapoda*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapoda).\n\nThey are absolutely beautiful and come in many stunning color combinations: [*Gonodactylaceus glabrous*](https://student.societyforscience.org/sites/student.societyforscience.org/files/main/articles/G-glabrous-female-Indonesia-May-2011-b.jpg), [*Odontodactylus scyllarus*](http://media.wnyc.org/media/photologue/photos/mantis_shrimp.jpg), [*Lysiosquillina maculata*](http://40.media.tumblr.com/a923504d11037e0bf6d9f3f3e1753b07/tumblr_mj1n29ecZm1rxyvj1o2_1280.jpg), etc. There are more than 450 species total and all of them awesome!\n\nThese guys pack a serious punch, as their front limbs reach maximum speeds from 12-23 m/s! That's impressive on land, but extra impressive int he water given all that resistance they are moving through. In fact they are so powerful they create a cavitation through the water, which is similar to a propeller moving through. What's fascinating about this though is it causes a small implosion in the water which produces heat, light and sound. Amazing coming from an animal, and such a small one at that! [This is a slowed down version](http://i.imgur.com/wwG9Hd3.gif), punching a crab. Also, they absolutely [hate Rubiks cubes](http://i.imgur.com/0d4HJx2.gif). They've been known to shatter aquarium glass so they can be difficult to keep in captivity (though mostly due to digging more than punching). You need the right container.\n\nMantis shrimp that do not have the sweet clubs to deliver a hard punch instead have stabby front limbs. These guys are actually a little slower than their clubby counterparts. A few species were tested for speed,  *Alachosquilla vicina* being one of them and it only reached a top speed of just 5.7 metres per second [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeRf6fhFvBA). The difference here is likely their hunting strategies. Our clubby shrimp are active hunters and need to be fast to catch prey whereas our stabby buddies are ambush predators so they don't quite need that amount of force. More on that [here](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2012/11/21/why-are-stabby-mantis-shrimps-so-much-slower-than-punchy-ones/). \n\nAside from this amazing speed they also have pretty awesome and interesting eyesight. This is an animal with compound eyes who can see in color, which is usually difficult to distinguish for compound eyes. Many arthropods, for instance, cannot see red and have a difficult time distinguishing between colors. Mantis shrimp can see red to violet, just like humans! They one up us though with their ability to see UV light. For example, the rock mantis shrimp, has six photoreceptors dedicated to this part of the spectrum, each one for a different wavelength. This is the most complex UV-detecting system found in nature!

The Soyuz is designed to come down on land, so there's a lot less flexibility than the US capsules had. They need a large, open, flat area hundreds of square miles wide and free of hazards. The Great Plains are perfect, although a little too heavily populated to safely be used regularly. But in an emergency situation where the Soyuz couldn't make their normal landing zone in Kazakhstan, they could rerouted to the US. NASA would then forward this document to all the emergency services in the projected landing zone to act as first responders while assembling their own team. \n\nIt made sense for the Russians. Soyuz doesn't have a lot of secrets we don't already know, and alternative landing sites are good.

Astronauts were probably put into orbit by kicking their asses with a huge boot... üòÉ Even if a nuclear blast destroyed the planet Earth, the Russian stuff would survive intact. It was another side of the coin. Admirable.","The name of the Russian Space Agency is \"Roscosmos\"","Roscosmos? Thanks.","This is a hoary old cliche, the \"Brute Force\" idea in no way corresponds to Russian space technology at the present, and was probably only true for a few short years after Sputnik. The US quickly eclipsed the Soviet Union in its ability to launch heavy payloads into orbit. The Soviets' heavy launch vehicle, the N1, had a horrendously convoluted and explosive design and test cycle before being cancelled in the early 1970s. Their lack of a heavy launch vehicle in the 1960s is one of the main reasons they never landed a human being on the moon.\n\nYes the US was far more advanced in terms of instrumentation and micro-electronics, but \"Brute force\" is a spurious concept, the Soviet Union lacked a true heavy lift launch vehicle until the Energia in the late 1980s. As for your nuclear blast gag, that's very misleading, Soviet and Russian satellites were designed with a totally different design philosophy, whereas American satellites were meant to be durable and stay operational for years, Russian satellites had a much shorter lifespan and were designed to be easily replaced. This is the reason the vast majority of payloads launched into orbit were Soviet during the Cold War, they were satellites that would operate for a few months, maybe a year and then deorbit (or be boosted higher into a \"graveyard orbit\") be replaced.","what I mean is: the US was all about microelectronics and computers, Russia was all about pipes, bolts, valves, cranks and astronauts kicking the ass of their equipment.","That still doesn't make any sense. You've basically taken the scene in \"Armageddon\" where Peter Stormare's character uses a wrench to save the day to describe 60 years of Soviet/Russian rocket history. It's a stereotype that gets lazily repeated. It's condescending \"Oh those Russians and their tractors etc etc\".\n\nAs for cosmonauts kicking ass, Soviet spacecraft were almost entirely automated (see Slava Gerovitch's work on man-machine systems in the Soviet space program) What Pipes? What Cranks? What Valves? Those terms are so generic or simplified as to be meaningless. American spacecraft included components that arguably could be described as all of those. Yes there would occasionally be some manned maneuvering when it came to docking and reentry, particularly in later Soyuz variants such as the Soyuz TM, but the cosmonauts were, overall, much less active in taking control of their crafts than their American colleagues. The cosmonauts did become adept at cannibalizing equipment aboard the Mir Space Station, but that has nothing to do with the rockets that launched them or \"brute force\". ","One of the funniest things I have watched in a long time was when they were doing a recent crew change on the ISS, aired live on NASATV. \n\nThere was some issue with docking latches, the indicators did not seem to be working properly, or there was an actual latch issue; and so the two American astronauts are having serious discussions, even getting out a laptop and running some info.

Although the original load is regarded as weak, it was designed for use against unarmored targets and was so slow-moving it would tumble almost immediately after impact and ruin the target's day. Great in theory. The problem was any obstruction, like an indigenous warrior's leather shield, would pretty much neutralize the round.

","Yes, the medical field of Radiation Oncology involves the treatment of cancer with targeted radiation. Just over half of all cancer patients receive some form of radiation therapy (typically in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy). Radiation creates strand breaks in the DNA of cancer (and normal) cells, so it can be used to preferentially target tumors. However, there is also a small probability that the DNA damage created by radiation is non-lethal and can result in a mutation that can lead to the development of cancer. In general, radiation is considered to be a weak carcinogen compared to other risky behaviors such as smoking.","\"Might as well take a few more minutes to let these fuckers out before I die...\"","They did,  and while the pistol is still on the manifest  of commander has chosen to actually fly with one on years.

If you do, you can cultivate a bond like I've got with my cats.

Eventually we tamed these wolves and gained their trust through food and through primitive genetic engineering(selective breeding) we come to the modern-day domestic dog. They are the perfect animal for humans, because they are molded into what we wanted/needed. Cats are cute and funny, but this threads op is delusional if he thinks our ancient anti pesticide comes close to the bond that can be obtained between a human and their dog","&gt;  Eventually we tamed these wolves and gained their trust through food and through primitive genetic engineering(selective breeding) we come to the modern-day domestic dog. \n\nI would probably add to this natural selection as a major component too (as opposed to artificial selection).

A fellow cyclist came by a few minutes later and waited with me until an ambulance showed up. ","I remember driving on Mass Ave in Boston late one night. Where I live it's a four lane city road, near a couple of hospitals. Anyway there's this one guy laying in the middle of the outer travel lane, couple of his friends just standing over him. There's a line of cars getting past them, nobody stops. So I stop and ask the friends \"is he ok? Has anyone called the police or EMS?\" And one says \"oh yeah someone's coming, he's ok\" - so I drive on but still call 911. I told them where it was and asked if anyone else reported it, they said no and thanked me for calling it in. I just couldn't believe these people wouldn't even do that, and tell people \"oh yeah it's cool\".","I had sort of the opposite happen - hit a pothole at the bottom of a hill by the Longwood T stop and flipped my bike. It was right around shift change at the hospitals and there were immediately 5 doctors and nurses asking me if I was OK and if I had hit my head. Someone even intentionally stopped and angled their car so I'd be protected from oncoming traffic. Both my bike and I were fine except for a bit of road rash, so it felt more embarrassing than anything. But in retrospect I'm incredibly grateful for their response. ","&gt; I just couldn't believe these people wouldn't even do that\n\nBecause a trip in an ambulance and a stay at hospital in the US means the next 3 generations of your family are paying it off.","We really need that fixed.","We should nominate some people to fix it. We could call it an election.","Yea maybe if you need emergency surgery...\n\nI got hit by a car and the ambulance + E.R  + x-ray (to make sure i hadnt broken any bones) bills came out to ~$485. I'm uninsured, but in any case, due to NY's no-fault law I wont have to pay a cent of it.","That's absolutely messed up.  But it's a classic case of the bystander effect in action.","Here in Germany, it's mandatory to take a course in first aid before you finish your driver's license.\n\nIt's then illegal to not stop for someone who is in need of first aid. I like the system here.","You guys have your shit figured out in a lot of ways over there. I loved Germany. ","Good Samaritan laws used to apply in the US. But have gone away. Don't know why.","I blame the Seinfeld finale.","Jesus.  I feel like I should stop when I see a car pulled over on the side of the road with car trouble, and I have zero clue how to fix a broken car.  I can't imagine not stopping for someone laying on the ground. ","Someone hit me with a brick and broke my front door window trying to break into the house. I chased them away and got the license plate. Three weeks later and the cops still don't even have the identity of the driver... and my friends are telling me this is normal.","I got hit by a car once. Hit and run. I was sitting on the sidewalk trying to flag someone down, with my bike still in the middle of the road, and three people drove by. The third was a cop. I was even flashing a flashlight at him while on the phone with the 911 operator, but he just drove right on by.\n\nTo this day, I am angry at that officer. I think if he had stopped, I could have told him a white Chevy Malibu just hit me and he might have been able to speed up and catch the guy. I made sure to tell him what I thought of his action when he turned around a minute later after I called 911. And his Supervisor. Fuck that cop.\n\n/rant","Yeah, one time, flying down the hill on 14th Street from Columbia Heights in DC, when a city bus swung out from a stop and clipped me on my bike. Luckily, I had my wits about me and I was able to go down on my side but still took a nasty skid. \n\nI was crumpled in the roadway when a passing motorist slowed alongside me and rolled down his window. I thought the guy was gonna check on me but instead all I got was \"HA, HA, HA!\" \n\nDude wasn't even laughing, he was just shouting it at me before driving off. Ended up getting back on my bike and having an equally rotten day at work. \n","wait...so the guy was...Nelson? \n\nwhat a shitbag","Could have been worse, they could have taken out their cell phones and then uploaded you to Liveleak.\n","Last time I got hit???\n\nHow often do you get hit by cars?\n\nThat shit freaks me out.

The light turned and she just started inching up without paying any attention at all.\n\n* One person ran a 4-way, thinking it was a round-about or something.  It was one of those stupid 'traffic islands', and I hate them too, but it was a clearly marked stop.\n\nNo injuries in any incident, though my bike got a new wheel in the later two cases.  The common thread? Visibility.  You have to ride in a way that you stick out a little.  This means taking the lane, lights at night, and understanding where drivers are likely to overlook cyclists.  For instance, I often stop at intersections nearly between lanes or near the curb.\n\nIt's not busy roads that necessarily get you, though the consequences are often worse there.  It's just inattention.  I've had plenty of people drive by me, revving their engines and so forth, but to their credit, none have hit me yet.  It doesn't matter if people like you or not, the psychopath that actually hits someone out of malice is pretty damn rare.

It's the safest way to ride.","I've been hit five times in the past six years. \n\nFirst happened when somebody shot out of a parking lot without checking to see if it was clear, he hit me. Second was a driver in a pick-up truck who decided that I wasn't allowed to pass him while traffic was stopped, he put his front wheel onto the sidewalk as I was about to pass him, I hit him. Third was a guy sitting in an unlit car at 5am, he blindly flung his door into me, I flew over it. He claimed he didn't see me, yet I had a ridiculously bright flashing light, so I guess he just didn't look. Fourth happened while I was stopped at a red light, a Taxi driver decided that he wanted his car to be where my bike was, so he hit me out of the way, then yelled at me like it was my fault even though I had been stopped for at least a minute. Fifth (happened thirty minutes after the fourth one) was a guy going well above the speed limit, who decided to pass me on the left as I made a left turn, hitting me from behind after I had already crossed the double yellows. \n\nI live in NYC, and the drivers here are about as aggressive and bad as you'd assume. Nobody yields, signals, or stops at signs. On every ride I go on, I have at least one moment where I feel as if I am inches away from certain death due to a driver that feels risking my life is worth shaving a few seconds off of their driving commute.","I can attest to this.  I live in the NYC area too and bike through Manhattan a lot.  I usually have an accident very year and a half.  The worst one was down west broadway when this skateboarder came outta no where.  He was a pretty big guy: 6'4 200lb, and I'm tiny: 5'5 135 lb, so I went flying.  Good thing I had my helmet on, but I didn't have my gloves :(.

First time my front wheel was side swiped by a car pulling out of a side road without looking. Of thay bike didn't have disc brakes I would 100% have ended with a broken left leg. Wheel and handlebars were trash. Serious road rash on my left ass cheek (jeans were ripped to shreds) and left arm. I ended up speaking to the guy as he drove me to work and learned that he was an illegal immigrant with no insurance, so he was very keen on 100% fixing me up and giving me a small cash sum to not involve the police. I shouldn't have agreed but fuck it, I needed the money. Ironically the bike was stolen not four days later. \n\nSecond time, a car swerved into the bike lane and clipped my rear wheel just hard enough for me to lose balance. The bike lane was between parked cars and moving traffic so I ended up breaking off a side mirror with my shoulder and then fracturing my right elbow after I twisted from the mirror impact who saw it all. That guy was stopped by another cyclist, police happened to be up the road, and the driver's insurance paid for repairs to my bike and the car I hit. ","Fellow Dublin cyclist! Where did you get hit? I got hit coming down Baggot St. A while ago, and I'm still very nervous around there.

Sorry you have to deal with that.\n\nUnfortunately, many places in the U.S. don't have bike lanes. One of your safest bets is to use the whole lane in those cases. I agree with avoiding busy roads when you can, but sometimes there just aren't good options.","Taking the lane is preferred where the law permits it.\n\nCalifornia has mostly clarified cycling law in that taking a lane is now strongly preferred.  Law enforcement may not be trained on these points, but, at this point the code is clearer than it has ever been, including the recent \"3 foot rule.\"\n\nAlways take the lane is the safest choice where the law permits it.  There are probably still plenty of States with law that does not support taking the lane, so know your rules.","Taking a lane is permitted in Florida, though I wouldn't do it in unsafe or annoying conditions. However, if I'm alone with no bike lane, I take it with pride. Right to ride, right to be seen. As a driver, I respect cyclists who have to share the road with cars. As a cyclist, I respect motorists who are kind enough to respect cyclists. Two accidents later, I do all I can to be seen and be safe. ","As once the victim in a similar situation, THANK YOU.

Saturday and the wife gives me my Honey-Do list. First up was a dump run. Rent the trailer and head over to get a helper to help me load. I was no further than 300yds from my house and to my horror I see a guy on a mountain bike riding towards me on the other side of the road as a car is drifting towards the shoulder, straight for him. Sure enough, he hits the kid doing about 40mph and Rag-Dolls the kid (hits him so hard, the kids body just goes limp). Throws him 20ft and flips him 3X in the air. I pull over quickly as I make eye contact with the driver. I am yelling at him to stop but he drives away up to the next light and makes a casual left into this subdivision of about 1000 homes. I run over to the guy and he's messed up a bit but is trying to get up. His bike is snapped in half and he's got one hell of a road rash. I keep him still and wait for the paramedics and cops to arrive. Sad that I didn't get the license plate number, I realize I had my video running in the car. I tell the cop of this and to my sadness, the file had written over itself and I lost the accident footage. Feeling bummed, I finish up and head out to finish the dump run. As I am heading out for my second trip. I decide, what the heck. Let me drive the main loop in the housing subdivision to see if I can spot the car. On th second street I pass, I look left and I cannot believe my eyes. I see an Acura TL of the same color about 10 houses down. I turn left and as I come closer. I see the passenger side mirror has been ripped apart. I park, walk to the front and lo, and behold. It has some serious damage to it. I pull the cops business card out of my pocket. Call him and they dispatch a unit to the scene. they knock on the door, kids mother answers it and she calls the kid to the door. Cops have him come out side and we are waiting for the cop of record to show up. I ask the cop if they are going to arrest him. Cop says it is up to the officer on the scene who took my statement. As soon as he pulls up. He looks at the car, looks at me. I nod that that is the kid. He walks over, doesn't say a thing and just hooks the kid up with a set of handcuffs. Got to postpone my honey-do list til tomorrow. Long day but a good day.\nFYI...kid is doing good at the hospital.

Yes. But what could I have done? I have no medical training. I can't even perform CPR. I would be literally nothing but a distraction and in the way.

Maybe the lady you saw has a dead phone.  Or maybe she's in such a state of shock that she can't coherently communicate with EMS.  You can.\n* Do you have a blanket or extra t-shirt in your car?  People in shock often feel cold, or you could use it to wrap an open wound until help arrives.  Or just offer it to someone as a gesture that someone out there cares.\n* Can you position your car behind the wreck and turn on your emergency lights?  That could reduce the chances that another driver gets too close and possibly injures one of the victims.\n* Do you have 2 minutes to spare to just pull over and ask if anyone needs anything?  You have a working car, you might be able to get something or drive someone somewhere.\n\nI simply don't buy the rationale that because you don't have medical training, and you saw a phone, everything's as good as it can be and you can move on with your day.

It doesn't tend to cause excessive drowsiness - which is why I used it and my sister as an example.","You shouldn't drive after taking medication the first time. ","And did your sister drive with those meds in her system? No she didn't, she took them once, noticed the side effects (even if they're not mentioned on the packaging) and would not drive under their influence.

I watched him go up to the next traffic signal and make a left. I have been driving for over 40 years and I can read car body language pretty well. He didn't race off. He casually turned left at that signal. that just made me feel he lived there. I decided to make a pass through the streets on my way to the dumps to may be see if I could spot the car. I know from experience that most Californians use their garage as a storage space, not a parking spot. So, odds were in my favor, he'd have to park it outside. So as I entered the subdivision, there is a main loop in the complex with side streets. So, as I passed the second street, I saw a car with the same color but it was about 10 houses away. As I got closer, I could see the side mirror was broken. Then I stopped in front and when I stood in front of it. I could see black radial patterns on the bumper that would appear to match a tire from a bike riding up and scraping the bumper.

It's not hard for me to understand why most people refuse your offer for counseling. I've been taking the same stuff every day for 10 years, I think I probably know more about the meds and how they will affect me than you. Moreover, if we had questions or concerns about the medication, wouldn't we ask an *actual doctor*, like maybe the one that prescribed us the medication in the first place? For the life of me I don't understand why pharmacists feel the need to interject themselves into a transaction that doesn't concern them. This is between me and my doctor, you are the cashier who I pay to hand me pills. Do we really need to interact more than me handing you a script, you handing me pills, and me giving you money?  \n\nEdit: yikes I guess I touched a nerve. I didn't realize so many people enjoyed having their actual doctor's instructions second-guessed by a cashier every month.","The pharmacist is required to ask. Also  if you have questions to ask about the medication it is better to ask than pharmacist than the doctor. Doctors often know very little about the medications they prescribe except the fact that it treats whatever ailment you have. Pharmacists are doctors who went to school to focus solely on medication and the effects it has on the human body. I have a friend that is a pharmacist, and the amount of times she has caught doctors making potentially fatal mistakes is truly frightening.","Doctors, really? Don't you think that's being a little generous? When your job can be replaced by a 2 minute google search, I'm not sure we should be handing out doctorates for that.  \n\nEven still, I think I'll continue discussing my medication with my actual doctor and not the guy wearing a name badge and manning a till inside a grocery store.","You have no idea what you are talking about. Ironic that you would cite a \"two minute Google search\" as your main point, when such a search would have quickly shown your misconception about pharmacists to be false.","lol man we're not talking about a 'conception' here much less a misconception. I'm talking about empirical experience and I tend to subscribe to the school of thought that believes the substance of reality is affirmed through empirical experiences. Never had a pharmacist offer anything of value other than being a self-important middleman. Never had a question about a drug that wasn't completely addressed by a quick internet search. And the great thing about google, it doesn't act all judgmental and holier-than-thou whenever I have to pick up a controlled substance! As if it wasn't bad enough that we have to take these pills, now we get an added dose of paternalism and condescension with every refill! yay.","I don't know about where you come from, and admittedly my experience is only in emergency medicine, but Pharmacists aren't cashiers. They are fully trained medical professionals, more over they are specialists.\n\nYour doctor is likely a general practitioner. This means they have a lot of medical knowledge disbursed over a dozen fields. It is not an easy job, and they have to keep track of a lot of information from every field. They may be very good, but some skills will diminish simply because they are not used as much, and as they don't have time to keep up with all of the newest medical advances in everything.\n\nIf you are eviscerated you don't want a general practitioner. You want a trauma specialist. Even EMT's and Paramedics may be more useful just because they have hands on practice with keeping you alive rather than just theoretical experience.\n\nIf you have a problem with your eyes, your general pracitioner is likely going to send you to an eye specialist because they do nothing all day but look at eyes.\n\nIf you need pills, your doctor sends you to a pharmacist because all day every day they interact with people taking the medications they are being prescribed and spend much more of their time reading on the effects of medications, interactions with other medications, and most importantly compared to what General Practitioners study: long term effects of use.\n\nAlso they are required to ask every time because of tha tlong term effects thing. Maybe you've been taking a medication for 5 years every day. Maybe your pee suddenly started turning brown recently. Maybe that pill is known to start damaging kidney tissue as it takes 4 days or so to be flushed from your system, and taking it every day means a high amount of it stays concentrated in the kidneys and it's time to switch out for a new medication for a few months to let your system recover.","My doctors send me to specialists for diagnosis and treatment. My doctors have never once sent me to a pharmacist without a prescription. They don't send me to a pharmacist for advice, it's the only place I can pick up my meds. I'm pretty sure if I told my doctor next month that the pharmacist recommended a different drug they would think that is weird and wildly inappropriate for someone who has no goddamn idea about my medical history or physiology to be making recommendations for treatment.  \n\nFinally, I mean, really. I think the fact that this person wears a name badge and works the register in the back of a grocery store says all there is to say about the hierarchical position of pharmacists. They're supposed to fill orders but I guess since they spent so much time in college getting their doctorate in pill distribution, they feel like they should get to have some say in your treatment. But even if these people are \"doctors,\" they're the only doctors I've ever met that wear name badges and work a register. I don't think I've ever seen an actual doctor (or any other professional for that matter) handling money, and definitely not at a cash register. It just doesn't seem like something that someone who went to school for half a decade would be doing. ","Yes it's required by law. Originally lawmakers wanted us to counsel every single time you get your drugs but they settled for just asking. \n\nAnd some people don't feel comfortable talking to they're doctor (may not think highly of them), or, more often, don't think of a question until later.\n \nAnd yes, we're the *drug* experts, whereas doctors are the *disease* experts, so 99% of the time whatever question a customer night have is well within our our view.\n\nBut you didn't touch a nerve with me FWIW","If you're the experts then why aren't doctors just diagnosing and then turning us over to your capable hands?","In some places they do, to make things more efficient (more time to see more patients), but most of the time it's not necessary. Medication guidelines and dosing have been very well established in 99.99% of cases, so it's easy to follow someone on drugs.\n\nIt's also a time consideration. Your average retail pharmacist is barely given enough time to fill the daily scripts, so adding on prescribing just wouldn't work. \n\nAnd it's also just a legacy of the past. ","Yeah, databases are starting to do the work of identifying conflicts and potential side effects.  My Cardiologist has a nifty one they pump all my medication through.  But they do still recommend \"Ask the pharmacist if you have any questions or want to change some of your OTC medications.\"  While you guys are busy, I can confirm that, at least in my area, even at major teaching and research institutions the doctors defer to the pharmacist for drugs.","Interaction checkers are absolutely amazing and are probably one of the best advances in daily medical practice, I agree. That's not really where the meat of a pharmacist's usefulness is though.\n\n\nFor retail, we have deal with customers... Anyone in retail knows what that's like. We also are \"the most interruptable healthcare professionals\". It's easy to call the pharmacy and ask a question, or figure out if you should go to the ER or not (I get several of these calls a week, it's not usually serious but hey). \n\nHospital / Clinical pharmacists get to do more of the fun stuff like dosing infants with drugs that have never been used in infants before and stuff like that. Then you have crazy awesome stuff like Nuclear Pharmacy. \n\n\nPharmacy, much like life, is 99.9999% monotony and 0.0001% something interesting. ","Oh, I know.

There's also the curious case of that guy who had a Saccharomyces cerevisiae infection in his stomach that turned carbs into booze, who, I believe, got out of a drunk driving charge.\n\nSo if your normal medication doesn't usually make you unable to drive and you have a reaction to it, there is a defense there. What there is absolutely no defense for is not stopping if you hit someone. ","You are right that it is not strict liability, but the bar for guilty intent is often set very low. In many places in the U.S., the enabling *mens rea* is to voluntarily consume anything that you know might reasonably be mind altering, and guilt adheres to all collisions involving a vehicle under your control. For example, you could have one mouthful too much beer, get behind the wheel of a car without touching the controls, be sideswiped by an out of control car going a 100 mph, and end up convicted of DUI murder. The offense is independent of whether the drug was part of the causal chain that led to a bad outcome. The prosecutor will actually tell the jury that you did nothing to contribute to the outcome but you should be convicted anyway.\n\nYou can thank the insane Progressive crusaders from Mothers Against Drunk Driving.","How does this help the mountain biker?

Often they're too young/haven't seen enough shit to really understand anyway. If the parent knows the difference, and consistently uses only punishment and never violence, then the child learns the rules over the course of their childhood and generally will grow up to be a good observer and enforcer of boundaries themselves.\n\nWhere's the line between the two? Punishment happens in quick response to deliberate crossing of a pre-established boundary and is proportional to the harm done. It's violence if it was too delayed, if the kid didn't know the rule, if they didn't understand the potential for harm, or if it's excessive.\n\nIt's not enough to just say \"don't hit your kid\" because psychological violence can be just as bad. The situations where you should consider physically hurting a kid are rare, but they do happen. Usually because the kid is dabbling in something that could get them or another person hurt, which is exactly the situation /u/feyedharkonnen was responding to.","Kids imitate their parents. If they see their parents use violence as a form of communication they will do the same. \n\nYou respond to a thread where the OP said he would \"beat the fuck out\" of his kids.

I would argue that if those kids behave this way it's probably because they saw their parents/role models being violent against themselves or others. \n\n","You're just making up definitions for \"violence\" and \"punishment\" to support what you want to believe..","Maybe.

Because parents shouldn't assault their kids, verbally or physically. If you're not smart enough to handle the situation better, you're not smart enough to have kids.","I'm not sure why you feel the need to insult people. I guess it's just that serious for you. But it makes me not want to pay attention to your actual comment. Maybe I'll come back and read it later.","Exactly. ","Tell me what medication you take that has no side effects?

I'm sure they'll learn their lesson by having a finger firmly wagged in their direction.","You realize there's a bit of a jump between \"finger wagging\" and \"beat the fuck out of\" right?\n\nYou're also absolutely wrong in your previous statement considering there are countless peer reviewed studies that show corporal punishment has far more adverse effects than positive effects on children. I can provide sources if you like, but a quick search on effects of corporal punishment should more than cover it.\n\nIt's often the kids that get \"whoops\" from their parents that have long term behavioral problems.","I'm going to take a wild guess and say you're not a behavioral or developmental psychologist. ","Hi, I'm not a psychologist but I do have a master's in mental health. Don't beat your kids.","I don't have to raise my hand to my kids, they're respectful to others and we'll behaved. But you got it,  if they ever turn rotten,  I'll just hug them harder. ","I guess I missed the part where I gave that advice.","Again, there's a huge amount of alternatives you're dismissing with extremes. It's not a black or white situation.","If it were your kids, how would you handle the situation? ","Well, to start I would consult with my wife of course, and also with the officers that were available. I would want them to face SOME legal recourse so they understood the gravity of the situation - especially considering kids can get their records expunged. I wouldn't be opposed to that involving a night or two in jail, a shit ton of community service, and a public apology to the victim.\n\nThey would absolutely lose the vehicle, and I would notify all of their friends parents that they were no longer allowed to drive. If they HAD to drive for some reason (work, school) I would put a tracker on their vehicle (with their knowledge of course).\n\nSince they threatened another human beings life, I would absolutely have them in therapy. I think it's important to be objective and want a psych eval to make sure they're not unhinged and they were being a stupid kid and weren't actually considering hurting someone.\n\nI would talk to them about this, a lot. It's hard to know the exact right course of action, because ultimately this depends on your child, your relationship with them, and the specific situation regarding it that is often more nuanced then a news story will report.\n\nIs the kid insecure and hanging around a bad crowd because they have self worth issues? Is the kid the alpha style bully that is pressuring his friends to act maliciously? Two very different situations, so the course of action should consider all of these factors.\n\nRegardless, my course of action would never involve physically attacking my child. The studies show it is counterproductive. Kids, and young adults, maybe even humans, brains don't work in a complicated manner like that. It isn't 'I did a bad thing, felt pain, don't do again' but like others have said, more likely 'physical harm is an effective form of getting someone to behave in the way you want them to,' which is arguably a much more simple interpretation.\n\nAlso, for the record, like you said, you have good kids. You seem like a reasonable guy. I think you're thinking emotionally and that this isn't how you would treat your children. If kids get to this level, they've either had terrible parenting, suffer from mental disorders, or are dealing with a high level of situation anxiety and insecurity. Maybe not always, but most of the time. Or they're just biologically a dick and need to be taught better, harshly.\n\nSorry this is so long and winded. You asked a pretty complicated question. I answered it the best I could.","This is also illogical. Obviously no one can be an expert in everything, most aren't in anything, and even those that are, are seldom an expert in more than a subject or two. \n\nOur best options are to research what the scientific consensus is for subjects we don't have expertise regarding. The alternative can be found in the anti-vaccine crew.","Are you?","No, but my kids aren't douchebags either. ","That's because you beat them? ","Typical Harkonnen. ","Gurney, is that you? ","Nope. ","You can't injure your child under any circumstance","No? Ok. Spare the rod and spoil the child eh? ","There's a very big difference between physical discipline and injury. Like old school rapping their knuckles or even giving them a smack upside the head isn't necessarily wrong, but one of my friends has a large scar on his forehead from a belt. That's wrong. ","Too true. If my daughters act up, I just give them \"the look\" and they know better. I've never had to give my kids anything beyond the time tested swat on the ass.

Not necessarily how this should work, but that seems to be how most states handle DUI. Even if the doctor didn't tell him not to drive and the medication can cause impairment. The fault falls on him/her for not looking through all the possible side effects.

","&gt;In legal terms, if the driver was prescribed a medication and led to believe that he would not suffer side effects that would diminish his driving ability\n\nAlmost all medications come with a warning about operating heavy machinery and directions to test the medication's effects on you before getting behind the wheel. It's pretty probable that whatever medication he is claiming caused the accident had such a warning.\n\nUnless he took one of the very few medications that don't warn you for the very first time and he had an allergic-type reaction, he's trying to duck responsibility.","I had to pay $500 for just the ambulance ride a few years ago. Really varies by location.","Are you saying you can't tell when you're too drunk to drive straight?","Provided you have no health insurance that's not true. Your ambulance ride will cost you the most, more than likely the rest will be written off as charity care by the hospital. You just have to know how to ask for it. \n\nIf you have health insurance it'll be harder to pay down but you're better off asking than not. ","Why do you even have to pay if you have insurance? Wtf is insurance for?","Insurance companies exist to benefit themselves. They successfully passed a law that makes buying their services mandatory. As congress and all other politicians are bought and sold, they can do pretty much whatever the heck they want.\n","#","if we're going to have private insurance, it has to be mandatory. it's the only way to get insurance companies to insure those with pre-existing conditions. \n\nalso, everybody is going to get medical treatment at some point. only the rich could afford it without insurance.","&gt; it's the only way to get insurance companies to insure those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nIt is impossible to insure pre-existing conditions. The dictionary definition of the word *insurance* involves only uncertain future expenses. What you are talking about is a tax-and-transfer program. Trying to graft such a program onto an insurance program is impossible. That's why Obamacare (formerly called Hillarycare when she ran it up the flag pole in the 90s) is in an economic death spiral.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with creating a health care handout program. Just do not pretend it has anything in common with insurance.","semantics aside, what do you find impossible about this?","The semantics are everything. Literally the meaning of the words.\n\nInsurance works by any particular bad outcome being unpredictable, but the average rate of bad outcomes in a large group being almost perfectly predictable. So instead of paying $0 for 999 times and $200,000 the 1 time something goes wrong, you pay $200 no matter what.\n\nBasically, insurance lets people pay for their average unexpected expenses. People are scared of surprise disasters, so they think this is a great deal. They would rather be soaked every month than live under a bridge.\n\nWhat you are talking about is to treat somebody who knows they need $200,000 as if they had no idea. So they pay $200 and get a guaranteed $200,000 payoff. It's like free lottery tickets. Pretty soon everybody who knows they need $200,000 has signed up for the plan. The plan has to raise its prices. The people with a $200 average expense are paying $5,000, which is a total rip off. So they *all* leave the plan. That means the price has to go up to $25,000, which causes nearly everybody else to abandon it. Pretty soon the people who know they need $200,000 are paying $200,100 for it (to cover administrative expenses).\n\nThen the people who know they need $500,000 hear about it and all sign up ...\n\nThis is called a insurance *death spiral*. It happens every time Leftists try to turn insurance into a handout program.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with a health care handout program. It can do much good. At a low price if sensible rationing is used.\n\nP.S. I have a pre-Obamacare insurance policy. It used to be that healthy people cancelled their policies and got new ones every year, so the sick people left behind had to pay a lot more over time. Well my premiums are barely budging since 2009! The people in my risk pool would rather keep paying for the sick members than take a risk on Obamacare. If I got a job with great insurance, I would keep paying for this high deductible policy I already have. If you know anything about insurance, this tells you that Obamacare is working as poorly as anything the Soviet Union ever tried. Death. Spiral.","&gt;So they all leave the plan.\n\nwhere do they go?","It varies. Some drop insurance entirely. Some switch to a new plan marketed in such a way that it attracts mostly healthy people. (You can buy mailing lists for such things.) Some switch to policies that exclude pre-existing conditions. (I.e., they get a job that provides health insurance, because deathly ill people don't work and therefore are rarely part of the risk pool).","if they drop insurance, they're still going to be funding obamacare through penalties. switching to a less benefit-rich plan doesn't change the risk pool (I'm assuming this is what you're referring to with plans that attract healthy people). insurance companies pay each other based on how healthy/sick their customers are. \n\nabout 1 in 2 adults have a preexisting condition so a huge number of people in this group are working.","We also have to separate health insurance from your employer. ","I currently have insurance through my employer and it's actually great insurance. Over the last several months I've gotten DME on specialist visits. Urgent care visits. Preventative care visits. Birth control (aka surgery). It's costing out of pocket: $71.\n\nDifferent plans in the US have different payouts it's not the same all across the board. Some people have 5 or 6 thousand dollar deductibles on their plans with a 10 thousand out of pocket max. \n\nInsurance exists to give the illusion of coverage without actually covering anything unless you're willing to buy into the more expensive plans. ","The one serious crash I had was completely covered by insurance.  That's ambulance, ER, imaging, emergency surgery, hospital stay, meds, visiting nurse at home, and months of follow-up care.  That was with a fairly typical insurance plan, nothing fancy.  It was also before the present administration's reforms.\n\nInstead of unsubstantiated anecdotes, that's a real-world, actually happened story.","I had no insurance and was having an asthma attack. Ended up in the ER and then was admitted for 3 days. I stopped counting the tally at $22,000. Had everything but the $1,000 ambulance bill written off. This was all prior to the ACA and current guidelines. \n\nI wouldn't qualify now for any of the charity I received but I also have significantly better insurance than I had, even a year ago. I bounced through HDHP and Medicaid plans before I ended up on my work insurance. It's scary because most of the current plans out there either for free or purchase are, at best, catastrophic plans. ","The company I work for is actually dropping our PPO plans for what's really a catastrophic plan plus a health savings account.  The health savings account is useless to most of us because we're mostly mid career or older, the savings account only really works if you start one when you're young and healthy.  I'm neither, and I have no clue how I'm going to cover the gap.  I may end up on disability, which is truly depressing.\n\nThe whole topic is irritating to me.  So many people saying that before they'd be wrecked and now they'd be saved.  The old system was not that bad, at least not for anyone I know.  I'm sure there are horror stories to be had, especially when HMOs were more common.  But the new system looks to be really bad.  We were promised by the President that we could keep our plans, and my colleagues and I our watching our so-so PPO options vaporize and be replaced by something that is not insurance.  It's so BS.\n\nThe government should have come up with a way of enabling us to buy our own insurance, without being dependent on employer provided plans.  Then we'd have more ability to go from job to job without worrying about losing access to our doctors or medication.  It would have enabled more competition.  Instead, it seems like they made a bad situation worse.  The cafeteria state plans are a joke in many states, including my own.  Looks good on the website, but the networks are horrible, especially for specialty care. \n\nIt seems like the only talk is either hard left or hard right political bickering.  Meanwhile, people are going to suffer.. and it doesn't seem like anyone cares.  This country has gone completely bat-shit crazy.\n"],["There will come a time when you'll ride 12mi one way and still feel like that's not enough.

The internet helps those who help themselves. ","Yes, I understand that as someone who engages themselves. But you should probably also realize that if your part of a community that refuses to make it easier for anyone (funny because you'd think tech dudes would be into usability, but I guess that's an engineering trait as well to value abstract functionality over ease of use or transparency), there's a reason it remains small. Regardless of whether *some* people can overcome that hurdle, it's still a hurdle. It's a rare engineer who realizes they're an expert in their subject matter and doesn't expect everyone else to understand them all the time, in my experience.","You should probably realize that it's kept small intentionally. If you teach everyone how to do it, then you're out of a job. I make money by explaining shit to people, that's basically my job description. If you don't have any money for me, then I don't have any time for you.  \n\nExpecting people to just teach you complex shit in a concise and succinct manner for free is being an entitled little shitter.

","I think your post sums of the attitudes of most engineers I've worked with; I think for the most part engineers lack empathy and expect everyone to adapt to them, while at the same time also being unwilling to learn from other disciplines, including other engineering disciplines (especially their own in regards to UI and functionality), and thinking their specialty is more important than others in the grand scheme of the operation. End goals like the customer, the bottom line, or efficiency are just obstacles to their own job, instead of things to tackle collaboratively with others.\n\nI mean, for example, that subreddit - no one's paying anyone to mod ANY subreddits, yet this one is one of the least helpful and most hilariously opaque sidebars I've ever seen.","Yeah, I'm sure you'll get a lot of shit done by being a raging ass-hat to your engineers.

","I don't understand this argument. Especially because it's not really true.\n\nWould these animals be extinct without the fact that they are currently being reared for the sole purpose? Possibly. At the very least they would have significantly smaller population sizes than they do (which would be better for the environment anyway).\n\nBut they also wouldn't be being born for the sole purpose of being killed and eaten (except for those that are milked/shorn/used for eggs/etc), which I think is what most vegetarians are opposed to. \n\nAlso, this ignores the fact that without human intervention we would actually become overrun by cattle. Because we have domesticated these animals, we have also by and large removed all of their natural predators. If everyone was to suddenly stop eating meat, what would happen to these animals? The population would explode (even more than it already has done). A good example of this can be seen in Hawaii, where a herd of a 12 cows exploded into a population of 35000 over the course of 50 years, and have seriously damaged Hawaii's ecosystem. \n\nThe correct statement is that if people stopped eating meat then we would have to commit cattle xenocide to prevent the complete destruction of our environment. And that's coming from a vegetarian. (Actually a better way would be to sterilize all of the cattle, and then just let them die of natural causes, but that could be a pretty long process.)","Still would go extinct, but I supposed they could use a little help.

I just don't think the food is *that* good. I don't like supporting those practices with my dollar.\n\n I can cook very tasty vegan food for myself, and occasionally I will eat a mushroom pizza or I'll go to Dennys and get eggs when I'm hungover. I don't think it has to be black and white. But I think that humanity has become too dependent on these awful practices.\n\n Sorry that this turned into a rant, but there really are a lot of people who think that every vegan is out to get them and wants to shame them for their choices.

If it was the same team making Generals 2 that made Generals and/or the other C&amp;C games, they should've done well enough.\n\nI have heard lots of complaints about Zero Hour being really imbalanced, but I haven't noticed that personally.  I never play online, just against computers, though.\n\n\nBut each general has its pros and cons.  USA has strong defenses, the best aircraft, and lots of minor strategical units like the Avenger or sentry drones that are worthless alone but are a must-have for defensive or offensive things.  I always back up my Patriots with Avengers, so aircraft can't hit them.  I also keep some in my base to handle any Generals Powers aircraft that breach my perimeter.\n\n\nThe Super Weapon general is a defensive powerhousepowerhouse.  Artillery or aircraft are an absolute must-have to punch through the EMP patriots.  Infantry can work, but just a few pathfinders can take care of that.  This is balanced with her lack of offensive units.  In longer engagements, I.E. the type won with superweapon, this means she's not going to be able to get new resource piles, relying entirely on supply drops.  With a simple Generals Power or superweapon of your own, you can decimate her entire economy.\n\n\nThe Airforce general is exactly that.  He has good planes.  The stealth commanches are rather nice, as are the Aurora Bombers.  Nothing else very special about him.\n\n\nThe laser general is odd.  He's not played very differently from the normal USA.  The laser defenses are a nice touch, since they're far more effective against aircraft and infantry than normal Patriots.  It's interesting to me how the laser tanks require power.\n\n\nThe game says China is all about overwhelming numbers, but I disagree.  To me, China seems like the brute force faction.  There's not a ton of strategy or finesse involved, just big guns go boom.  It does take a lot of money though, so economic management is a thing.  I don't play China much though, I'm a turtle, and their defenses suck against most generals unless you supplement them with bunkers full of rocket soldiers.  So I can't really say much about each individual one.  \n\nI like GLA's versatility.  Anti-air, infantry, and tank defenses, scorched earth and direct attack strategies,  all of that.  There's a GLA counter for most everything China and USA have.  Plus I love how they don't require electricity.  I looove spamming Scud Storms.\n","&gt; How bad could it be?\n\nIt was basically an extremely bland SC2 knock-off. One of the maps was literally Metalpolis.\n\n&gt;  I mean maybe the story for the campaign sucked\n\nThere was no campaign. Generals 2 was being developed as a multiplayer F2P game.\n\n&gt; If it was the same team making Generals 2 that made Generals and/or the other C&amp;C games, they should've done well enough.\n\nIt wasn't. After the disaster of CNC4 the EALA team was dissolved. Generals was being developed by a new studio called Victory Games with no previous experience with RTS.\n\n&gt; I have heard lots of complaints about Zero Hour being really imbalanced, but I haven't noticed that personally. I never play online, just against computers, though.\n\nZero Hour was horribly imbalanced, but it was ridiculously good despite that. I played it competitively for many years, I wish I still could. USAF dominated due to it's cheap Chinooks that were difficult to harass and having a ton of powerful generals abilities, while having negligible downsides compared to vanilla USA. The GLA generals were all very good as well. The super weapon general was absolute trash.\n\nCompetitive Zero Hour is very, *very* different from what you experienced in single player (basically nothing you described applies to competitive matches). If you want to see what it's like, check out [some of these guys' videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnCYzupbmdaAg7_hjEeYQKYaLwFtkhyG), they're shoutcasts for high level Zero Hour games.","Is SC2 any good?  The only non-EA RTS I've played was CIV5, which wasn't all that great\n\n\nI didn't know Generals 2 was made so late into things.  I'd only briefly heard about it before, but I assumed it'd been attempted probably around the time of Tiberium Wars.  Can't imagine why they'd try to dig up that universe that'd been dead for years with an already mostly wrapped up story for an online game.  I think the online game they've made now off of Tiberium Wars makes more sense than that.","I generally liked China the most. I disagree that they are not really for overwhelming numbers, but brute force. USA is more a brute force for me. I never really had the chance to play online matches because I got into the game late, but when I played with Hard computers I would end up using either the infantry general or the tank general. I really liked the Overlord tanks, especially once you got a good horde of 9 or so. And as far as the infantry general went, the mini gunners in the upgraded unit carriers (I forgot the exact name) were even good against small tanks, again, in small hordes. Once you got a line of bunkers, especially with the infantry general, and filled them with rocket units or mini gunners, you had a system better than standard Patriots. I also especially found Black Lotus useful. She was faster and safer for capturing oil rigs. As far as getting money went, hackers in large amounts were a constant flow of money, especially once promoted to veteran. If you could hide them in a corner of your base, they were excellent. Finally, I also found the nuke to be better than the Ion Laser. It was more powerful and less discriminatory. ","&gt; USA is more a brute force for me.\n\nUSA was all about unit micro. Put some missile defenders in a humvee (called an mdvee), then micro the ever living fuck out of it to defend three fronts simultaneously. Tech to strategy center, get Search &amp; Destroy, then use your now long ranged mdvees to push back. Once you get in their base you've basically won.","For the same thing us military uses them.

My original point was that in many instances it's more humane to leave an animal in the wild as opposed to breeding it/capturing it to raise in captivity.

They commented about how the ones who treated the animals callously were easily removed from the program as the dolphins wouldn't do what they were asked from the mean handlers.

I would rather have a bunch of dumb teenagers fucking around on birth control than a bunch of kids that have limited access. It makes a huge difference. ","Why are you arguing for contraceptive availability. That's not part of my argument. My argument is that even if every woman was on contraceptives she still chose to have sex, she still chose to gamble her womb.","\"Gamble her womb\"?\n\nSo you subscribe to the theory that a baby is punishment for the woman daring to have sex? Do you then also subscribe to the theory that that baby deserves some kind of support from the same government that forced its existence, or should it just live its life unwanted or in poverty?\n\nOr, rather more simply, do you just believe that sex is evil and the woman deserves to be punished for having it?","Why are you okay with abortion in the case of rape? Is it because it wasn't the woman's \"fault\"? Are you filtering your opinion of abortion through the lens of whether or not the woman was at \"fault\" for getting pregnant? Do you care about the life of the baby at all?","Why are you quoting the word \"fault?\" Women have agency, they're intelligent people with the ability to make decisions based on consequences. If a woman gets pregnant after consenting to sex then yes she is at \"fault\" for getting pregnant. \n\nIf she said \"no\" but got raped then she never consented to the fetus being there in the first place and thus has the right to take away consent from the fetus. \n\nOr, more probably, if she knew the man was using a condom but if he took it off without her knowledge and bust inside her then she is not consenting to the pregnancy. But only if she doesn't notice. If she does notice he did then it is her responsibility to take the morning after pill, etc.\n\nI'm basically bridging together the rights of the host with the responsibility of the host. Trust me, I'm not taking this stance based on feelings but rather straight logic. Life is secondary. (And btw, a zygote is alive and is a person and is a human).\n\nIf you can convince me that a woman never consented to the pregnancy while still consenting to a potential pregnancy then I **will** change my stance. I used to be wholly pro-choice because I'm a libertarian but my world view evolved.\n\nEDIT: I'll reply to your other comment here. Yes, a woman gambles every time she consents to sex and if she gets pregnant then she has to live with the consequences. At least until she gives birth. The fetus didn't choose to be conceived so it's not its fault don't blame the baby. The woman can give it up for adoption and the government will take care of it. As is the case today. If you ask any single person today if they would rather die or live in poverty you would see that people are glad they're alive or they'd commit suicide. ","&gt; If a woman gets pregnant after consenting to sex then yes she is at \"fault\" for getting pregnant.\n\nFault. n. \"responsibility for an **accident or misfortune.**\" (emphasis mine)\n\nThis implies that the act of getting pregnant is either an accident or a misfortune. Why do you consider \"getting pregnant\" to be an accident or misfortune only for the woman? Do you not consider the man partially responsible for this accident or misfortune?\n\n&gt; If she said \"no\" but got raped then she never consented to the fetus being there in the first place and thus has the right to take away consent from the fetus.\n\nWhy? Is all life sacred, full stop? If so, why allow the woman to terminate the baby? If not, then why not allow the woman to terminate the baby in other situations?\n\n&gt; Or, more probably, if she knew the man was using a condom but if he took it off without her knowledge and bust inside her then she is not consenting to the pregnancy. But only if she doesn't notice. If she does notice he did then it is her responsibility to take the morning after pill, etc.\n\nSo what if she did notice that the man had deceptively finished inside of her but was too poor to afford the morning-after pill at that time? Should only rich people have sex?\n\n&gt;(And btw, a zygote is alive and is a person and is a human).\n\nThat is extremely debatable. A zygote is a parasite. It cannot sustain life outside of its protective womb, and feeds off of the nutrients in the blood of the mother. Without that direct blood transfusion, the zygote dies. Is it a human? Yes. But it is also a parasite until it's capable of living without that direct transfusion.\n\n&gt; Yes, a woman gambles every time she consents to sex and if she gets pregnant then she has to live with the consequences.\n\nSo sex is a sin and pregnancy is the punishment? Is that what you're saying?\n\n&gt; The woman can give it up for adoption and the government will take care of it. As is the case today.\n\nSo you would put the woman through a grueling, possibly life threatening, and expensive procedure (birth) just to have the unwanted baby taken away and put into the hands of the government? What kind of libertarian are you? You're advocating for a massive expansion of government in order to handle the welfare of all of these babies.","Alabama?\n","Well.

In any case, I think we would ride out the zombie apocalypse just fine here in the US :P","yeah looking at some statistics i am surprised by how few large population centers the US has. only two, really. new York and Los Angeles could sustain that size of militia and with all the guns owned by people and gun stores can likely arm that many too. a handful might manage 300-500 thousand. the rest can likely only manage about 100 thousand or less. but there is a lot of cities so combining militia's could bring about very large state militia's.\n\nnot a lot of countries can mobilize so much so fast. it's definitely an advantage when defending the country, all tho it has not been necessary. ","&gt; new York and Los Angeles could sustain that size of militia\n\nThat's like 30% of everyone living in NYC, though (also half or more of LA's population). It's just not feasible, even if you handed them all guns. They just wouldn't know how to use them properly. Maybe a few thousand at best for the biggest cities. The rest would have to flee as refugees. Gun culture in the cities is a far cry from rural or even suburban America. If it came to it, several states might be able to raise something around a million or so.\n\nIn less urban areas, however, I would expect to see a higher percentage of people owning their own guns and being able to use those guns effectively.","traditionally, militia are armed peasants. doesn't have to be military age males, its a militia not a professional army. im pretty confident they could amass than many guns, and enough ammo for everyone to have a little bit. in an event of a large scale conventional war you can bet your ass more than a few thousand militia would come from new york. \n\nif new york was unable to be evacuated and faced extermination, they would just arm everyone with whatever they can effectively forming a probably about 4 million man strong militia. wont do you any good against armor but armor does not hold cities, infantry does. and you would need a full size army to take on 4 million, even much less than that. even if they are very ineffective, as militia frequently are, that's just too many armed people potentially all over the place for anyone to really seriously consider a manned invasion of the country.\n\nthe reality is, of course, that professional army's are way more effective, the US one is so effective i don't think any nation would actually be able to get troops into the US in any significant number, and certainly not with armor. best option is to land in canada or mexico and work the way up or down from there, but by the time they get there, there will be tens of millions of militia prepared with some basic training and some basic armor/weaponry. that's if the US feels their professional army wouldn't be able to to the job.i personally think that in any situation possible today, the US army could do the job without having to directly involve the populace.

I don't think so. I live in Upstate NY and I would say that guns are far more prominent here. Realistically, the military would set up blockades *and* evacuate the city as quickly as possible in order to avoid the risk of targeting American citizens (we're gonna assume this is an invasion by sea or paratroopers or whatever). That help from other states would be from the armed forces, not militia groups.\n\n&gt; 4 million man strong militia\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. You expect every other NYer to pick up a gun and fight? They're gonna be leaving so the army can do their job. I would hope that every American would allow the better-equipped US army to do its job regardless of whether they [individual citizens] have the capacity to fight on their own or not. It's not a matter of cowardice or anything (and you never said anything of the sort, but I just feel like expanding here), it's just that the army should be able to do its job effectively without worrying that it's bombing its own citizens. Would come in handy against that armor, too.\n\n&gt; that's just too many armed people potentially all over the place for anyone to really seriously consider a manned invasion of the country\n\nYeah, you're absolutely right. I've seen so many foreigners joke about America having two armies (the armed forces and every gun owner, lol), but America seems to be unique in that sense. I could see armed militias filling in the gaps for the army if it was getting overwhelmed, but that would require (in a non-nuclear attack) a massive global alliance to even get there.\n\n&gt; the reality is, of course, that professional army's are way more effective\n\nYeah, exactly. If someone tried getting in through Canada or Mexico, we wouldn't stand by. Both nations are among our top trading partners and are US allies.

People are already skeptical of the government, and you want to take away their rights and demand they give their firearms to the government? It will never happen. There are already right-wing militias in place who actively want a fight with the government and your proposal to criminalize firearms would radicalize even more people. This country was founded on overthrowing tyranny.\n\n&gt; Only a minority of a minority will actually try to violently held onto their guns... these people will be put in jail.\n\nNo, it would end in a complete fucking bloodbath.

No, because just as with the weapons industry, the prison system is privatized and those companies are not interested in improving the system and lowering their profit margins.

That should be kinda near the top priority but not number 1.  They knew the risks when they signed up for the job.  Number 1 priority should be the safety and protection of the citizens who hired him/her.  If that isn't the top priority for them they should consider a different line of work.","Tell that to all the superior officers in any force. \n\nEvery police force in the USA will tell you that the number one priority for police is to get home to their family.  You can disagree with me all you want, but you'd be wrong.","If an officer decides not to protect/serve/help a citizen because \"he might not make it home to his family\" that's pretty fucked up.  He was hired to serve and protect.  It's the god damn motto and the main point of having police officers.  If officers are turning and running away from anything remotely dangerous (which is what you do if your top priority above all else is to get home to your family) we need new officers.  ","That's not at all wtf I'm saying.  Learn how to actually read what argument is being made please...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfi3Ndh3n-g","&gt; #1 duty above all else\n\nI clearly read your argument.  \"ABOVE ALL ELSE\" must mean something different to you than the actual meaning.\n\n&gt; That's not at all wtf I'm saying.\n\nOnce again \"above all else.\"  That has a VERY specific meaning.  Either you chose poor wording or that IS \"wtf\" your saying.","now you're changing the argument.  \n\nYour top priority is to get home safe to your family which means maintaining safety in the daily occurrences that happen during a day in the life of an officer.  I in no way said cops should run away from anything \"remotely dangerous\" as you stated.\n\nGetting home safe means when you see a gun and the suspect doesn't comply with your telling them to put it and/or yourself on the ground, you shoot for safety of yourself, your fellow officers, and the community around you.\n\nSo yes, their job above all else is to get home to their family.  That doesn't mean they don't have to do the job at all.  Quit pulling baseless arguments out of something you don't understand apparently and learn to actually understand the points being made because you are arguing points I never made and ignoring the ones I do.","&gt; now you're changing the argument. \n\nNo you are.  \"#1 priority ABOVE ALL ELSE\" means forsaking any and everything that isn't that priority.  That is literally the definition.  You either chose poor wording or you are changing the argument.  \n\n&gt; Getting home safe means when you see a gun and the suspect doesn't comply with your telling them to put it and/or yourself on the ground, you shoot for safety of yourself, your fellow officers, and the community around you.\n\nYeah if they see a gun and the person doesn't comply they should fire.  That is a different argument than forsaking your duties as an officer to protect and serve.  Once again you said \"ABOVE ALL ELSE\" which translates to any and all situation for that officer not just guns.  If its dangerous in ANY way \"above all else\" based on your words they should run the fuck away to make sure they get home.  \n\n&gt; So yes, their job above all else is to get home to their family.\n\nNo, the taxpayers are not paying them to go home safely.  We want them to but were paying them to protect and serve citizens.  \"#1 priority above all else\" is serving and protecting.  Followed by staying alive and coming home to there family.\n\n&gt; Quit pulling baseless arguments out of something you don't understand apparently and learn to actually understand the points being made because you are arguing points I never made and ignoring the ones I do.\n\nYou are tap dancing around the what \"above all else means\"  You are doing all the things you claim I am doing.  Ignore my points and claim they are baseless with no evidence to support your claim.  At least I have a definition for what \"above all else means.\"  Is it a semantics issue?  Maybe.  At least I have some basis for my claims.","first  no its fucking not. a police officers first job is to serve and protect. not put their lives above all else. again the issue isnt people pulling fake guns so much as scared trigger happy cops murdering people and children. second stop acting like being a cop is like a movie, its not.","dude my father, uncle, 3 cousins, grandfather, great grandfather and great great grandfather are all police officer.  I make my thoughts and claims based on experience of knowing well over 300 police officers across 7 different forces.  It's nothing like the movies you are right, you are MORE LIKELY TO DIE from a lapse of judgement in policing in the real world.  There is a INSIGNIFICANT % of police who are trigger happy and go around murdering people.  You obviously know nothing about the profession, things happen much quicker than you could anticipate.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfi3Ndh3n-g\n\nIDK why I'm arguing with you since you obviously won't change you mind, and you are more then welcome to your opinion, but that opinion is wrong.  End of discussion.","Dude knowing cops doesn't mean shit. I've known 100's of police officers as well. I grew up knowing the sherriff of our county and most of the deputies. The problem isn't that there millions of bad cops. The problem is the unions and good cops backing up the bad cops. The video you shared was a joke and completely unrealistic. One only a bad cop is coming at you gun drawn, this limits your reactions to pulling the trigger. The one scenario there is almost nothing could be done to stop it whether you are shooting or not. If someone wants to kill a cop. They are going to do it. The majority of scenarios there are a million better ways of handling it. ","you're an idiot.","Yes I'm the idiot. Not the guy endorsing murder","less than 1% of police kills are murder.  I'm not endorsing murder. I'm saying you have no experience with policing or how they are trained and for what reasons they are trained as they are.  I don't endorse murder and think cops who act incorrectly should be held accountable.  I also know that acts of police brutality and murder and such are a very uncommon practice.  An officers job is to get home to their family.","I mean, don't shoot me if I'm walking around with something with a bright orange tip at the end (and I'm not shooting it at anyone). Otherwise, yeah.","but cops dont just shoot kids who have them for no reason.  sure it HAS happened but very rare.  Most cases, the guns are found to be toys after the kid is shot.  The guns get the tips painted in many cases and there is literally NO WAY for you to know the difference if its real of fake even with an orange tip whos to say its not real and they painted orange on the end.","Funnily enough, only airsoft requires orange tips and (these next rules only apply to CA) bright colored 2cm thick strips of paint/tape around the stock, grip, trigger guard. Not pellet guns though, because that would make too much sense.","Pellet guns can still be lethal. ","Because pellet guns can actually hurt people.\n\nYou can hunt with airguns.  Lewis and Clark used one for hunting and protection during their expeditions.","Have you had whooping cough before?

The worst that has ever happened to me from a vaccine was a lite fever that just lasted about 6 hours.  This year's flu shot made me feel ill for about 4-5 hours this year.","But then why guns!?\n\nBan the toys and the real ones. Look at the real problem, which is people walking around waving guns.","Yay another post about vaccinations,  give it a rest,  just a circlejerk ","Eh, not the kids fault.  They wouldn't be able to do anything about it (idiot parents would not listen to child/ren).","Yes, the problem is that back when it wasn't as widely accepted due to lack of scientific evidence it was used by the left to advocate for positions they would be advocating for even if it wasn't as  scientific fact.\n\nInstead of global climate change being an issue of science, it became a political tool.","If your aunt is a cougar then I wouldn't care.","...unless it is fucking folks I disagree with.","Confirmed Hillary Clinton voter.","Not man made.","Well you only stated global warming in your post.  On that note I'm pretty sure the overwhelming majority of science suggests that it is highly likely humans are at least contributing to it.","No they don't.","I know she's family... but fuk your aunt.","It's funny how knowledge changes everything. I'm neutral on chemtrails because they don't exist (and if they were effective, nobody would care, would they?), I'm pro-GMO because they provide a cheaper, more productive, more resistant food source in an era of increasingly difficult food production and lacking space, and global warming is, undeniably, true.","I like you too ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)","r/HailBigPharma","Well... if your decision negatively impacts the lives of other children around you...","How is it hypocritical to want to both keep your guns and use tax dollars to fund relief for natural disasters?

","What kinda convo were you having that went from nerf guns to vaccination? ","That is pretty ignorant, we don't vaccinate but I can't think of any valid reason to ban Nerf guns. ","why dont you vaccinate? ","I don't trust the profit motive and politics surrounding vaccines. It's the same governments and corporations that spy on you and send your kids to kill people overseas that push them, I'm not anti vaccine, if you do it, fine, if not, that's fine too. I just can't bring myself to give my kids chemicals that come from someone I don't trust to prevent something as ultra rare as these diseases, diseases that won't even kill you. Maybe when my kids are older I will get them but the fact is, they give a lot more now, and in a different manner than when I was a kid, and it is literally impossible to know the future effects because they haven't been doing it long enough to know, no amount of science can see the future.","She's right. Your stance on vaccination notwithstanding, she's right, it's not the government's place to mandate this issue, it's a personal choice, and personal choice is a fundamental American Liberty.","You're right; the bottom line is that she's this child‚Äôs mother, and she alone know what‚Äôs best.

She knows.","I don't believe this occurred at all.","Being pro 2nd amendment is a liberal stance.  The right to bear arms is a liberty, liberals by definition are for individual liberty.","By definition, liberal is \"open to new behavior or opinions and willing to discard traditional values\". Whereas conservativism is not willing to discard traditional values. \n\nWhat this means varies from country to country. In the US, this means the social conservative opposes gay marriage, but is pro-gun-rights. Whereas the liberal is open to challenging either or both of these values. \n\nThe liberal-conservative divide, thus, has nothing to do with individual liberty, and more to do with the willingness to challenge traditional viewpoints. There isn't really a coherent philosophy or beliefs that unites either groups, it's more of what-is and what-isn't regarded as traditional values.\n\nSome liberals, for example, may want to push tolerance towards all religions. Other liberals may however believe that religion is the problem and that we should value reason and science, dismissing religion as supersititoin. Meanwhile the social conservative may believe that Christianity is the traditional value of the country and we should strive to preserve that. \n\nMost people have a mix of conservative and liberal viewpoints, but may lean towards one side more than another, based on their overall willingness to challenge traditional values.  ","Yeah dude is confusing liberalism with libertarianism. ","No, you all are confusing liberalism with progressivism.  Only in the US does \"liberal\" mean what Americans have perverted it to mean.","I don't think so. I think progressivism is a belief that change is necessary. That's different from how /u/Romaine603 has characterized liberalism. ","I think he pretty clearly characterized it as progressive.  Each example he gave was a \"change\"","He states that liberalism is an openness to change. This is not the same, though it may overlap with, believing change to be necessary. ","But it isn't. Liberals are generally open to change, when juxtaposed to conservatives, which are by definition resistant to change, but that's just incidental and is not the core of the philosophy.\n\nThe etymology is the biggest clue here.\n\nhttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=Liberal","The traditional definition of \"liberal\" as referring to liberal politics and the liberal arts refers to the study and exercise of being a free person.\n\nClassic liberalism, and the liberal arts, very much espouse individual freedom.","American liberalism strays from classical liberalism, which promotes the rights of the individual such as those guaranteed by the 2nd amendment. ","If only that were actually true. ","The democratic party has plenty of non-liberal (authoritarian) views.  Just because the media decides to call democrats \"liberals\" and republicans \"conservatives\" doesn't make it true by definition.","I definitely understand your point and I agree.

Which btw...that point made by the other guy...Disney is not \"forgetting the prequels.\" \n\nThey still sell prequel merchandise and promote the old films a bit in collections. Also Disney is just currently leaning on the OT because many of the stories in the new films are directly influenced by that era (Sequel trilogy/Rogue One/anthologies).\n\nI'm holding onto a Clone Wars SWBF2 until official word says otherwise!","I would love a clone wars era battlefront. \n\nI respond every time someone says this in the hopes that someone influential may take pity on me and actually make this game. ","It was a remake. I agree it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been and DICE definitely isn't it's old self as proven by Mirrors Edge Catalyst, but it's fun to pick up and play a match or two when you're bored. Yeah it's a bit shallow and basic but it captures the feeling of Star Wars and it's great fun, and that's all I need from it.\n\nThe connection issues suck though.","It was absolutely not a remake and please don't ever call it that. The original had *significantly* more maps. The original allowed for *significantly* larger battles. The original had a campaign, galactic conquest and space battles. The original had *significantly* more vehicles. The original had 6 classes.\n\nThe \"remake\" has ~~well~~ under 75% *less* content. That's my estimate being very generous. ~~It's probably more like 90% less~~. It doesn't remind me of the original games at all. It just has the words \"Star Wars\" on it.\n\nThere is no excuse for this. It is 2016. If anything, there should me *more* content.\n\nEDIT: the math was done!","I apologize. I meant Reboot. It is a reboot. I think your estimate is a little off though. Battlefront 1 has 16 exclusive maps and ~24 including the ones also in Battlefront 2. DICEs Battlefront has 15 maps in the base game +4 more in the paid DLC. Even if you don't pay a dime after the base game purchase, there's still more free maps and content patched in every other month or so. Unless I'm doing math wrong that means the new battlefront only has 76% of the content of the original. And we're not even getting into the absolute beauty of the game itself compared to the original, heck, it makes games that came out *last year* look only decent graphics-wise.","76% is pretty close to my nice estimate, I changed my comment accordingly! That's still pretty bad though :(\n\nBut A+ for the graphics, Dice. You really have to appreciate that one. Ever see the mods for it though? It's difficult to tell what is a picture and what is the game with some mods run through a 4K (or higher) PC.","I agree. The graphics were one of the main selling points for me. Just Gorgeous.","Puhleaze, prequels for all its flaws were superior because of Lucas who actually has an original voice.\n\nYes jar jar sucked.\n\nBut I believe it was unfairly criticized. The prequels got crap for green screen which led to wooden acting and compared to OT but Lucas is the founder of ILM so of course it makes sense he's going to push it to its limits and now we see may films with heavy use of green screen and cg so it was ahead of its time and a pioneer. Also, there were more practical sets and models used and if you compared the percentage TFA used and PT, the difference will be negligible. Lucas was getting back into the director's chair after more than a decade away, cut him some slack and the movies got better as it went on especially with episode three which stands right behind episode six. And I think there was a case of the fanboys knowing too much about how the sausage was made in the OT regarding its origin eg certain discarded ideas which led to denigrating of Lucas' ability when any good story will have been rewritten and contributed to, but Lucas as director then producer had the most responsibility for its quality.  The highly regarded Clone Wars had Lucas as consultant to the writers.\n\nThe OT gave us so many inarguably awesome things, Darth Maul, the Duel of Fates, Obi Wan who they now wanting to make a movie on, the Jedi Council, a thought-provoking commentary on a republic turning into a totalitarian government which is all the more relevant now, a moving arc for Anakin that leads perfectly into the OT, the duel on the volcano, expanding the world.\n\nI hated TFA because it slavishly ripped off entire moments from the OT, when it wasn't ripping it off it was leaning on it too much, and when it wasn't leaning too much it was giving us weak storytelling and directing. Yes TFA did have some good points in a sea of bad but it's fatal and unforgivable error was being a copy.","Neither, I'm just saying J.J.

Dirks a class act. I'm already dreading when he's gone. Still hope he stays involves in all the stuff in Dallas ","He will be undoubtedly. He has a 5 million dollar palace here in big D and has his family here. ","I mean, you can buy and sell homes fairly easily these days.","He won't leave ( I believe) . I once saw an interview where he was asked whether he wanted to return to Germany at some after his career and he said no, because Dallas has become his home and he doesn't want that to change or so","Happen to have a link? Sounds awesome","This sums it up, it's the good shit people do when they don't think anyone is watching. ","I don't follow basketball at all and I remember seeing that episode and thinking what a great guy","I know almost everyone in The US loves Dirk, but we Germans adore him so fucking much it's unreal. No one really I mean NO ONE in Germany dislikes him. His sportsmanship and his maturity makes him so great. Absolut legend , we love YOU man.","I think he is as close to unanimity as it is possible for any basketball player, ever. ","I have never heard anyone say one bad thing about Dirk through all these years of getting drunk and watching ball.","He used to get ripped all the time before he won a ring for not playing defense. ","He just doesn't have the will to win!!\n\nShows how dumb that argument about anyone is dumb","I remember back from maybe '04 - '07, Dirk was seen as a bit of a hot-head. He seemed to have a short temper with his teammates at times. The Mavs lack of playoff success in those years would get to him and he would have outbursts. Keep in mind, I'm only talking about the playoffs. In '06 when they lost to the Heat in the finals, he was like breaking stuff on the way back to the locker room after game 4 or 5.\n\nI'm saying all this because he absolutely had the will to win and he wanted it so badly. But his career hasn't always been sunshine and rainbows, and he wasn't seen in a positive light 100% of the time.","When he lost to the Warriors during the We Believe year he picked up and threw a giant garbage can going back to the locker room. It made a big hole in the wall which the warriors framed. He was a good sport about it, signed it and everything. The Warriors are going to try to move it with them when they move to the new arena.","Here's the hole: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_mKYyVUsAANVP2.jpg:large","Looks like the [Patriots logo.](http://i.imgur.com/AM9F1BV.png)","Dirk to Patriots confirmed ","I didn't know he signed it.

He still has the hole to this day and had me sign the spot. He remains among the best bosses i've ever had. ","Yep. Nobody is \"championship material\" until they actually win a championship. Self-fulfilling prophecy that means literally nothing.","It's held as the ultimate individual accomplishment even though it's ultimately a team metric","It's perfect material for today's brand of journalism. It's appears to be true right up until the moment it's not. ","Everyone says you can't win a championship, until you finally do.\n\nHappened with Peyton, Dirk, LeBron, Jordan, Shaq. I mean it's hard to win one championship, and until you do, the perception is that they'll never win one. ","Yeah. Bill Simmons rips him in the Book of Basketball's greatest players pyramid for all the reasons you mentioned. Also called him \"soft.\" All of the pages about Dirk really boiled down to, \"he's great, BUT he has no rings so I'm not putting him with the greatest.\" I wonder where Bill would put him now that he has one.","If I remember right he also says that if he does win a championship it puts him on a whole new level. I want to say you're just telling one side of the story here.","Which is just fucking stupid. Dirk was the same player on June 11th, 2011 as he was on June 13th, 2011. And Terry getting hot and scoring 8 straight to keep Dallas in game 2 doesn't make Dirk a better player.\n\nI love Simmons, and love the book, but the take on Dirk was and still is dumb.","I know what you're saying, but Dirk's 2011 playoff run is his greatest basketball accomplishment, and really did put him on another level in my mind.  He got revenge on the Heat, got his chip, beat Lebron and played like a God the entire playoffs.  \n\nObviously Dirk is still one of the greatest players ever without the chip, but just the way he made that run and got it, especially with the context, was legendary.  ","God that run was legendary. And against the Heatles too, the \"flu game,\" most fun I've had watching an NBA finals. ","Me too man. Game 5 was on my birthday, after we won was the most drunk I've ever been in my entire life. Haha.","I made my girlfriend sit in a Froyo for like two hours watching game six because when we were ordering Dallas started its 21-4 run. She was asking why I cared since I'm a Bulls fan and I pretty much explained your second paragraph to her. I still don't think she understood but man that game was epic. ","And SWEPT my defending champion Lakers in pretty convincing fashion, and still had me cheering for them in the Finals against the Heat... I don't know another time that has ever happened to me.","Idk man, ask dirk when he really felt like he was one of the greats he will say when he won a chip. ","&gt;Dirk was the same player on June 11th, 2011 as he was on June 13th, 2011.\n\na) He wasn't the same player on June 13, 2011 that he was on April 13, 2011\n\nb) Even if he was, how are we supposed to know that. \n\nDirk didn't win a ring riding on someone else's coat tails. He went out there and won it as the main guy. How you respond to adversity - playoff losses, going down in series, everyone picking against your team and keeping their belief high, crucial turnovers and missed shots - and leading your team, all of that matters. And having evidence of it - in the form of winning - matters. \n\nLook at all the people on Boogie or KLove. Talent isn't the end all, be all. \n\nLook at Melo - isn't there criticism, at least partly deserved, of his lack of playoff success? He's not in the top 20, right? But what if next year he comes back in the best shape of his life, becomes the best playmaker he's ever been, and the Knicks win a championship? NBA history isn't predetermined - you have to go out there and prove that your talents can turn into accomplishments. ","Agreed.  It's kinda unfair to downplay the whole championship talk because that's what it's all about.  Dirk's ring makes him that much more respectable on the list.","You don't think championships matter at all when ranking the greatest players of all time? He wasn't just ranking the players in order of basketball skill,  and championships matter for your legacy of greatness.","I liked Simmons' book when it first came out. But in the 8 years since then, he's all but proven himself to be a very opinionated, basketball blowhard. I always enjoyed reading 10k word articles on the NBA, but listen to him long enough and it's painfully obvious he's just a witty fan with a huge following.","...Bill has never claimed to be anything but a witty fan with a huge following. I like reading his book and articles, precisely because it's just a passionate fan's take. I don't always agree with him, nor do I really take him too seriously. He's like listening to a normal, funny guy who loves the game. That's his whole schtick. ","I swear I heard KG call him a nazi in TD Garden once, but my friends disagreed.","I wouldn't be surprised.","People hated him for being soft for a loooong time. I heard so many times \"he's a big man that doesn't play like a big man!\" It was dumb, but yeah","I remember being a kid in Dallas telling these people, \"But he's pulling their big *away* from the basket! Look how that opens up the floor!\"\n\n\nTheir response: \"He doesn't get boards. He wants to be a 7-foot shooting guard.\"\n\n\n\n\"But he's **pulling their big away from the basket**!\"\n\n\nPeople just didn't see it the same way.","Did you follow the NBA before 2011? He was hated on pretty heavily for being soft.  Everyone started loving and respecting him after 2011","Lady I used to bowl with called him \"Dirk the Jerk\", so at least one person doesn't like him.","As someone in Houston, my buddies talk a ton of shit about how they personally dislike Dirk, greatly dislike the Mavericks, and absolutely HATE the city of Dallas...so at least some people out there are saying bad things so you don't have to.","Yeah I moved to Houston for work, their favorite pastime here is hating on Dallas. I had no idea the cities even had a rivalry until I went to college. They kinda appear to have a massive inferiority complex down here, which is weird cause Houston is a cool city in its own right ","What? People in Houston don't hate Dirk. Your friends are outliers","The Dirk hate was real in the T Mac/Yao era. ","I've honestly never heard of anyone hate on Dirk on a personal level.\n\nWe make fun of his whiny face sometimes but not many people think Dirk is a shitty person\n\nAnd we want to beat Dirk especially bad because he is a legend.","So your anecdotal evidence trumps his anecdotal evidence? Got it.","I'd be pissed off at the rest of the world if I had to live in Houston.","It isn't too bad. We have great food, a good variety of different weed types to purchase in neighborhoods of varying danger, solid local musical talent, and most of our teams have badass throwback jerseys.","\"a good variety of different weed types to purchase in neighborhoods of varying danger\" \n\nNailed it.","At least you wouldn't have to live in Philadelphia ","I hated him for the longest time. I would call him 'Dork No-Wits-ki' as a kid because he made me so mad when he played against us. ","savage","Other than the whole choker thing before 2011 ","Tons of people in San Antonio hate him and the mavericks ","You'd be surprised.

","Was travelling (as an American) through Europe last month, it was amazing to me how many times I saw Dirk on random things in Germany (was in Munich) and Pau in Spain (Madrid, Barca).  I always forget how much international pull Basketball and, by extension, the NBA, has.","That would be weird for me as a German from Dirk's hometown. He really only has endorsement deals with a German bank and Nike. You hardly ever see him unless you are at sports venues.","Pau was definately more prevelant in spain than dirk was in germany, i think mostly it was sports/shoe stores for dirk.  But over here those would be Lebron/Steph/Kobe/KD posters, so it was fun to see.","Was also abroad for a few months.  I saw Pau all over Spain, but only saw dirk a few times in ads around Germany.  Mostly saw a lot of mavs hats or jerseys or german jerseys with nowitzki on them, which was pretty cool as a Dallas fan.","W√ºrzburg lets go :D","Was checking into a youth hostel in Ireland last summer and the guy at the desk saw my place of birth on my Passport and smiled and just said \"That Steph Curry is something else man!\"...thought that was really cool.","Wow that's awesome, I go to Ireland every other year or so to visit family and I've literally not met a single person who cares about basketball. Probably because all my family is old lol","Probably because your mascot is a satirization of their culture.. /s","How could anybody not like Dirk? He was my favorite player in the 2011 finals. He's such a good human person. ","That was one of the best playoffs ever. I'm still kind of wanting for that kind of a playoffs. I *really* miss the damn Heat dude.\n\nI mean, rd 1 was already crazy as the Blazers came \"this\" close to a come back, and ended up beating the Mavs more than they got in any other series. \n\nThen in rd 2 the upset, capping off with the last anyone will remember of Bynum, as he clotheslines a guy, takes his shirt off right after, and dips out in disgrace. Such a disgrace, Phil Jackson's last season, Lakers were supposed to be contenders and they get **swept** \n\nAnd of course this was the first year of the Heat. Biggest titans of all time. Not 1, not 2, not 6, not 7, not 8. Then Jason Terry gets that tatoo and it's like cmon man.\n\nAnd the Mavs come out with some Carlisle sorcery on defense, Terry **absolutely** backing up his trash talk, and Dirk being Dirk and manage to pull basically the biggest NBA Finals upset I can personally remember.","I agree. I never thought I'd say this, but I miss those Heat. It was awesome to have a team that we could all universally hate. The Cavs and Warriors just aren't the villains like that.","As opposed to being such a good racoon person","Can confirm: Today I was walking past a park here in Berlin, and there was a few kids playing ball. As I walked past, not a single person said anything negative about Dirk. ","I'm not a huge Mavs fan but was sooo happy when he got his championship.","Is Schroder just chopped bratwurst to you?","Schr√∂der is...a difficult case. Sure, he's young, he's got potential, but his personality is not very *impressive*. He does not seem to be as cautious and thoughtful as young Dirk was. His performance at the European Championship was decent, but he tried to do a lot on his own - a totally different character on the field compared to Dirk in the national team.\n\n","A lot of German NBA fans root for the Hawks because of him. I Like him a lot and think he has potential to be a starter.","Ah that explains the cavs flair.","So I know that basketball isn't popular in Germany. Do non-bball German fans still know who he is and love him?","Know yes. Love no. ","Non-bbal fans here probably only know him through news and a few commercials he made. If you ask somebody what they think about him i think many will answer that he is a nice and funny guy, but i doubt that many actually know how much success he had in the NBA (Thats just my opinion)","Yes, people who don't really follow basketball but know him don't realize how much of a legend he really is. A friend was shocked to hear that he is 6th all time in scoring. ","He got some big media exposure during the playoff run that led to the title. People always knew we had a great basketball player over there in the states but mass media wide, he was kind of under the radar. But during that time virtually all media outlets had features about him. Heck, even my 60 year old mom told me how she thinks Dirk is an awesome human being.","I was so scared you were about to tell us that Dirk is the Jackie Chan of Germany...    Dirk is a first round HoF'er in MULTIPLE countries. ","You know that slogan, \"This is why we play\"?\n\nI have the utmost respect for Dirk as this is what he does day in and day out. Always showing love to fans, looking great in front of the media; I can't be more pleased with such a great player and person like Dirk in the NBA.","I can't think of a person that I know that dislikes Dirk; even fans of his rival team. \n\nHe is a brilliant, hardworking and real dude. I fucking love me some Dirk. ","I can't express how much I admire and respect Dirk. He's done so much for the city of Dallas and the Mavericks.","I was at the game last night, I was slightly heartbroken cause when Dirk subbed out for the last time, he put a towel over his head\n\nThen the whole crowd started the Dirk chant, it was amazing. I'm going to cry when he retires","Is there a link to this?","I wish. I rushed to try and record it but it happened pretty fast. The mood was dead, but everyone that stayed through the end of the game was chanting his name, it was awesome","Dude I was there too, that seriously made me so sad. He's killing himself carrying the team and still getting beat easily and it's tearing him up. My section tried to start a \"thank you Dirk\" chant but it didn't work haha","Ive said this before and i will say it again. Dirk is the greatest athlete Dallas has ever had.","He's the king of Dallas sports. GOAT for our city. ","Really? Even better than all the great Cowboys players?","Yep, and here's why: Dallas made Dirk, and Dirk made Dallas. \n\n\nWith the Cowboys, you have a long history of great players like Aikman, Staubach, Sanders, Irvin, and Emmitt, and you have coaches like Landry and Johnson. Those guys worked together (obviously not all of them at the same time) and achieved a lot, winning 5 Super Bowls. For the most part, those players were always pretty good, and their team was always good. \n\n\nDirk came to Dallas when the Mavs were terrible. The team's cornerstone was Michael freakin' Finley, and he couldn't handle the weight of an entire franchise. The team was in the gutter, and the future didn't even look too bright. Dirk came in as a young kid fresh off the boat from Germany, and for a moment, we Mavs fans got our hopes up. Over the next 2 decades we watched this guy go from a reputation as a soft Euro to one of the greatest to ever play the game. We were there for nearly 20 years watching every single part of his career. We saw him struggle his first few seasons in the league. We got excited when he and Nash started taking the team to the playoffs. We felt his pain in 2006 and 2007. We watched him take the team to the playoffs year after year, only to fall short. We cried tears of joy for him when he won it in 2011. He's now the embodiment of the franchise. He's been here forever through thick and thin. It's impossible not to associate the Dallas Mavericks with Dirk Nowitzki. ","Couldn't have said it better myself. ","There has never been a more cathartic sports moment for me than winning the NBA title in 2011. I went downtown and it was just such an outpouring of emotion from everybody there. I was a cashier at a grocery store at the time and as the playoffs went on it was all anybody could talk about coming through my line, they would make score announcements over the loud speaker during the Lakers series (Central Market in Plano) and the entire store would go up in cheers.","This post made my cold heart feel something. :')","I actually just teared up a lil bit :')\n\nsaving this comment, sums up how literally every Dallas Mavs fan feels about Dirk perfectly","God I'm so fucking glad he got his ring. ","Yea","Okay ","He barely pays attention to the first few calls but when he hears the little kid he instantly moves towards them, awesome, good guy.","Those kids were probably pissed that Zaza snuck in and got some dap while their hands were still out soaking in the Dirk 5","That's near NBA All-Star ZaZa to you","more all star votes than deandre jordan idek why mavs fans were mad","Mavs fans weren't mad.

For the most part, those players were always pretty good, and their team was always good. \n\n&gt; Dirk came to Dallas when the Mavs were terrible. The team's cornerstone was Michael freakin' Finley, and he couldn't handle the weight of an entire franchise. The team was in the gutter, and the future didn't even look too bright.

Over the next 2 decades we watched this guy go from a reputation as a soft Euro to one of the greatest to ever play the game. We were there for nearly 20 years watching every single part of his career. We saw him struggle his first few seasons in the league. We got excited when he and Nash started taking the team to the playoffs. We felt his pain in 2006 and 2007. We watched him take the team to the playoffs year after year, only to fall short.

","Honestly what a freaking legend ","Cant dislike that man","I think it's one factor among many, many, many others. I'm significantly more interested in how/why a guy has(n't) won a title. Dirk didn't win a title for a long time for two main reasons IMO: he only really had one truly elite roster (2007), and he was often a bad defender in an era in which he had to go against the likes of Duncan and Gasol. The latter is a much more fair and relevant criticism than simply \"he never won a title.\"","2007 was NOT an elite roster. ","Not even close. Jason Terry is a very very good player but not elite, Josh Howard had an excellent season but how many NBA fans even remember who he is? The rest of their rotation is filled with such luminaries as Devin Harris, Desagana Diop, Jerry Stackhouse, Devean George, Erick Dampier.\n\nIn the playoffs Austin Croshere was their 8th man off the bench. Austin motherfucking Croshere. It wasn't a deep roster and it wasn't a particularly talented roster, just a bunch of good role players and Dirk.\n\nHonestly I think they typoed and meant to say 2011.","We have never had an elite roster, that is why Dirk has 1 ring instead of 4 or 5.","I mean, Simmons addressed it pretty in depth and why  he would  be bumped up if he was the best player on a team that  won the title. I don't get why him being bumped up a lot for winning a ring over the Heat wouldn't be fair, and his criticisms were fair in my opinion.","Because it's a ridiculous standard on which to judge someone. Using that as a metric is saying that Dirk is a better player because Wade didn't hit that 3, a play in which Dirk wasn't remotely involved, at the end of game 2 (assuming Dallas would have lost the series if he did, which is far from a guarantee but is very likely). How does that even remotely make sense? How does wade missing a shot completely away from Dirk impact how good Dirk has been throughout his career?","Because winning championships is the single, ultimate goal every season, and it is fair to hold not winning a title against him when they've gone in as very high seeds many times and had never been able to accomplish that even when going in with 67 wins. Obviously championships aren't the only thing that matters in a career and you can be amazing and never win one, but acting like being the best player on a championship team vs. repeatedly falling short of expectations in the playoffs and never having won a ring should be irrelevant is nuts.","Repeatedly? Other than 2007, they basically lost to a better team every year (the only other possible exception being 2010, when he was very clearly overmatched by Tim Duncan, which is a much more fair criticism than simply \"he's never won a ring.\") Look year by year at who they lost too. If anything, they exceeded expectations more often than they fell short (2003, 2006, 2009, 2011 even before actually winning the title).","They had a contender for a long period of time, went in as a top 3 favorite to win the ring multiple times, and had never walked away with a ring. Obviously there were other good teams in the playoffs every year, but it isn't like he was KG on the TWolves going in with a great player but no shot at a title","&gt; went in as a top 3 favorite to win the ring multiple times\n\nWhat times, outside of 2007? The only other times they were even a top 3 seed in the West alone were 2003 (when I'd assume the Nets, Spurs, Kings, and Lakers all had better odds, but not sure how to find gambling odds going back that far), and 2010, when Cleveland, Orlando, Boston, LA, Dallas, and maybe Phoenix were all contenders, I'd say Cleveland, Orlando, and LA all had unquestionably better odds.","Yeah, that qualifies as multiple. The Nets were not better odds in 2003 and they were about even with Kings and Spurs, and they were above Pheonix and Orlando in 2010.","Sure, 2 qualifies as multiple. But then say 2.\n\nThe Nets were the clear best team in the East in 2003 after making the finals the prior year. I'd bet anything that find sports book's odd from April 2003, the Nets (and Spurs) had better odds than Dallas.","who gives a shit about arguing over hypothetical odds we can't find at this point, if you don't think championships really matter I get it and that is your prerogative  especially with being a Knicks fan and everything, I guess I just disagree.","2007 was not even close to an elite roster, our best players after Dirk were Jason Terry and Josh Howard neither were star players.","As a trailblazer fan, I've been known to talk shit about that giant yeti.

I got there about an hour after it started because of work, and someone tells me that they saw Dirk, but \"I think he left.\" :( I'm a little bummed at this point. I go about wandering the Dave &amp; Busters and seeing other Mavs there. And suddenly Dirk appears and he goes towards the air hockey and starts playing against a girl. There's only 3 people around him. I run around trying to find my friend to take a photo of me (I have a DSLR with a flash with me, so I was serious about this photo.) I get my friend who is on the other side of the building, and we go back towards the air hockey. Dirk is swarmed now. So swarmed that a police officer is escorting him through the mass of people. He is heading towards an exit, so I worm my way through the crowd to beat him to the spot. I am  holding up my drivers license and yelling, \"Dirk! It's my birthday!!!\" like an excited child. The policeman is trying to pull Dirk out of the crowd, but Dirk stalls and shakes my hand and takes a photo with me before being taken to safety. I'm so proud of this guy being our franchise hero. Seems like one of the nicest, most genuine superstars athletes. I also tried to get a photo with Marion by telling him it was my birthday, but he just said,\"Happy Birthday\" and walked on by.

And LeBron is definitely an ego maniac. After all of the bs with \"The Decision\", his big dramatic return to Cleveland, basically telling his teammates last year that they were background to his return, him getting his Nike agents to confiscate videos of him getting dunked on, etc. its safe to say his ego is huge. He literally has a \"Chosen One\" tattoo.

It's a highly competitive game, you have to do whatever you can to antagonize your opponents.\n\nNo you don't. You can, but it isn't necessary.

Dirk and Till Br√∂nner (a world class jazz trumpet player) were on one episode on a night out in Dallas. Great one hour of television of two people who are at the top of their game in their respective fields. It was back then when Nash was at Dallas.

I am glad he got a ring. ","Basketballgott?","I don't mean to disrespect a legend like Dirk, but as incredibly talented of a player as he was in the mid 2000s, he was soft. There is no reason James Posey and Stephen Jackson should have been able to effectively guard him. I think he even realized that after 2007, toughened up, and got himself an effective post game, as unorthodox as it maybe. He was one mean son of a bitch in 2011 and I have unbelievable amount of respect for him.","I think he started to get more physical in 2005. For all of his faults as a coach, Avery Johnson had an enormously positive impact in getting Dirk more active around the basket.","You are absolutely right. I remember being incredibly impressed with his ability to finish at the hoop through contact in the 2006 play offs, and then being flabbergasted that he wasn't shoving Posey into the low block, getting the ball, and shooting over the top of him (that and the ridiculous number of free throws Wade was getting)","Wait there are people who DONT like Dirk?!","The \"rings\" argument is so silly and fan-pandering, and it's no surprise Simmons relies on it...","I hate it. It's a team accolade not an individual one. I don't think the number of rings should be that important when determining who were the greatest players. ","Number of rings shouldn't be the most important factor but it's more important in basketball than in just about every other major team sport. A top 5 SF can play 48 mins a game and guard positions 1-5 and will his less skilled teammates to a series win thanks to his 33-14-12 statline. A top 5 CF can hit a home run in every at bat of the World Series and still lose bc his teammates suddenly forget how to play baseball. An individual player has so much more impact on their team's success which is why rings are more important to a basketball players' legacy. QB's are the only other team sport athletes who face the same pressure to win a championship to ensure their legacy amongst the greats. ","&gt; QB's are the only other team sport athletes who face the same pressure to win a championship to ensure their legacy amongst the great\n\nWhich is still incredibly stupid because no QB can have the impact a star NBA player can.","Quarterback is such a difficult position to properly assess. No way in hell the Broncos make it to the SB two out of three without Peyton Manning. But in the one he actually wins, the kicker has more of an impact on the score than he does yet I doubt they win the same game with Brock Osweiler. ","No way in hell they make it or win it without Von or that defense though. Nobody ever says \"x DE is good, but they haven't won a SB so they're not *that* good.\" There's 53 people on a roster, 22 starters, that only play half the game. No QB in the history of the NFL is capable of taking over a game like an NBA star but the ring argument is so volatile when discussing them and it's stupid.","Agreed. But a top tier QB completely changes the dynamic of a team on both sides of the ball. The Denver D was really good with Tebow. Manning joins them and suddenly they are in the discussion for best of all time. That is the power of a top tier QB. Then LBJ drags an injury ravaged Cavs squad to a competitive Finals and you realize that basketball is a team sport won by supremely gifted individuals. More than any other team sport or position. Rings don't tell the whole story but they make the good stories infinitely better when it comes to hoops. ","Preach ","Gonna disagree here, but only in the context of how Simmons uses it in the BoB. Maybe you haven't read it (maybe you have), but he specifically mentions if a guy is the best player on a championship team (or the second best, or third best I think is as far as he goes). That has actual meaning to me. Rings are not the end all and be all, but there are only a handful of players in the league at any time that are really capable of being the best player on a team that is able to get the ring. It absolutely is what separates a guy like Malone from Jordan. Or right now, a guy like Durant from Lebron. All 4 of those guys are MVP winners, all-time greats, absolutely transcendent superstars. But two of them won rings, and two of them have not. You can't really say that Malone never had a team good enough, he had another all-timer by his side his entire career and an elite coach in Jerry Sloan, plus plenty of good role players in his time. Maybe Durant hasn't quite had as much luck (see Brooks, Scottie; Waiters, Dion; and Harden, trade) but he got to the finals with a great roster, came up short, and just hasn't managed to get back yet. Those are meaningful distinctions. Another example is Hakeem, when Jordan left to play baseball, a lot of teams were capable of winning the championship in those two years, but it was the Dream who destroyed everyone he came across and came away with two rings. \n\nI don't think rings alone mean anything in a vacuum, you just have to look at Robert Horry, a ton of goofy celtics role players from the 60's, and the immortal Mark MadDog Madsen to know that. But among the games absolute all-time greats? They're meaningful.","Isn't Duncan up there as well ?","Yeah the word \"soft\" was thrown around a lot when talking about him","Well, he is a white basketball player.

","Those are indy lights which are a spec series. ","These are Indy lights, but formula 1 cars are built by their respective teams. The constructors (teams) usually consist of two parts; a chassis builder, and an engine builder. Hence names like McLaren-Honda. The name that comes first is the chassis builder. Then you've got all the customer teams, some of which are hugely prestigious like Williams. They're a customer of Mercedes for engines. The token system can be a little confusing, but as engine developments happen throughout the season, teams spend their allotted tokens to replace and refine their engines. The way this shook out last year is Merc ended up with their series 4 engine and all of their customers were left with series 2 or 3 engines. Ergo, the engine manufacturers currently control everything today. The race for the P1-4 is between Mercedes and Ferrari right now. It's still not really a race, Ferrari has a lot of catching up to do. \n\nIn terms of difference between the teams, the chassis and engine combination design is where the formula sings. In regards to your original question, there can absolutely be differences between the teams, so long as their conform to the rules for constructing. The front wing is a great example of difference. Haas is basically the American Ferrari B team, and a Ferrari customer for power, they've been fiddling with the design their front wing (aerodynamics) so far this season. \n\nAll of that is specific to formula 1, but since you just said \"formula\" in your comment, I feel compelled to add some info about spec formulas like FormulaFord or FormulaRenault. They are spec built cars, meaning all the cars on the grid are the same, to really showcase driver ability, rather than constructor's design. ","This is old. Like 2013 old.

But you're right, it might not be that it's the fastest line, just an effect of a slip stream. Does anyone know more about slip streams?\n\nEdit: yes I know drivers actively try to utilise a slip stream. But I reckon to an extent the car is drawn into a slip stream as well. No? Also, a slip stream allows cars to drive more efficiently, not faster, as they would crash into the car in front if they went faster.","It's not an \"effect of the slip stream\" that somehow funnels him into the same path, it is because the driver behind does his best to stay right behind the car in front since that means he has less air resistance and thus can drive faster than the guy in front of him.\n\nIt is something drivers actively try to do, not something that just happens because of physics.","This interests me, I know it's a thing in nascar with the generally car shaped cars, but in f1 following too close messes with the areo on the front wing, it's why drs is so important to overtake in f1, so in indycar with the different aero setups for the different types of courses I wonder how following close effects the car","The issue with f1 cars following each other is through corners. Down a straight they draft like anything else. When they get to the corner though, they have less grip than the guy in front.

","Thanks, answers my questions","&gt;f1 following too close messes with the areo on the front wing\n\nIt messes with the aero in the corners which is why it is a negative but on a straight you still get the 'tow' from the car in front.\n\nThat is why when they overtake on a straight the overtaken car will pull back in immediately behind the car that overtook them to try and get a bit of a boost and if really lucky make a move.","Thanks I'll have to keep an eye out for that during the upcoming Russian gp","Then I would buy a flying car if I won the lottery.

This is by the way not far from what you're seeing in the US about abortion right now, it's obviously about religion.","Yes, you can. Ataturk is widely loved in Turkey, but a cold assessment of his legacy is straightforward: he was a military dictator who wanted Turkey to become a democracy only once he felt people would vote for the outcomes he wanted (i.e. western-style secular government). And that's why he wasn't himself elected, and after he died the military had the specific job of overthrowing through force any government that it felt was insufficiently in the spirit of Ataturk.\n\nAtaturk did this because he knew if he tried to immediately convert the ex-Ottoman empire into a democracy, people would just vote for the most religious leader and it'd go back to being a theocratic dictatorship. Turkey at the time was extremely poor, backward and the population was mostly illiterate, so not a great foundation for building a democracy.\n\nOne of the things Erdogan has done is eliminate military rule in Turkey. That means the military no longer overthrows the ruling party because it's considered too islamist.","His party uses religious populism, media censorship, and terrorist scaremongering to gain \"support\". Their narrative is that if the people don't vote for them, suddenly there will be mass instability and bombs will go off all over the country. It's a terribly fascist technique, but it works.","You know it is illegal to insult Ataturk in Turkey as well? Its the same problem.","Indeed.

Apparently flying the Turkish flag is in some places seen as an anti-Erdogan sign, [because some Turks see Erdogan as a non-Turk](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/08/06/is-armenian-an-insult-turkeys-prime-minister-seems-to-think-so/).\n* On a [Turkish National holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Sovereignty_and_Children's_Day) she tweeted this: [\"It's bizarre that something as nationalistic as a flag stands for #fuckerdogan -there are strikingly less of them by the way\"](https://twitter.com/umarebru/status/723770925078986752). \n* This tweet got a lot of angry reactions, probably mostly from Turks seeing a tweet with #fuckerdogan in it and a photo of the Turkish flag, without even understanding the Dutch message.\n* [Turks on twitter then reported her to the police](https://twitter.com/jitemdiaspora/status/723947675931041792) who arrested her yesterday evening.","Being a Turkish descent, means she higly probably has a Turkish passport and is a Turkish citizen. Many Turks in the EU have two nationalities.","&gt; While there she reported on the anti-Erdogan sentiments she encountered. Apparently flying the Turkish flag is in some places seen as an anti-Erdogan sign, because some Turks see Erdogan as a non-Turk.\n\nOne of the major political groups in Turkey, Kemalists, believe that Erdogan is moving the country away from Ataturk's ideals and towards an Islamic state. They also see the flag as the symbol of a secular Turkey (well, as secular as Turkey has ever been).","So is Erdogan finally considered a full blown dictator yet?","Anyone who doesn't think so is an idiot or an Islamist.","Let's all pretend to be surprised. I feel like Erdogan is just testing how much it takes for the EU to be \"deeply concerned\" about his shit.","My list of reasons for never going to Turkey gets longer every day.","Which is a shame, Istanbul is like the Rome of the east (literally considering it was the capital of the Roman Empire for 1000 years), plus countless other amazing ruins and countryside in Anatolia. God damn it why do these dictators ruin everything ","I actually had a trip planned to go visit Istanbul but canceled in the end. What a shame indeed ","As a woman, the list of places I want to visit gets smaller by the day. Thanks religion!  ","What a progressive world we live in! ","I'm a female who lives in Turkey and previously lived in Spain for a year.  I'm pale and young and I have blonde hair and blue eyes.  The way I have been treated as an outsider has been infinitely better in Turkey than it was in Spain.  While there are some real problems regarding gender in this country, I have felt respected and protected by Turkish people, probably more than I would have at home in the UK.  In fact, some of my best experiences have been in Islamic countries.  There are obviously huge differences between being a visitor and being embedded in the culture, but it was a real eye opener to me.","Depends on the Turks you are around. The conservatives and super religious folks... they suck. The educated, intellectual, liberal folks are lovely people, by and large. They are also the anti-Erdogan people.","I agree to an extent, and think that most people aren't aware of the many educated Turkish people who do not support the government and have more in common with you average European than they do with the hardline Turkish Islamists.  On the other hand, I have met plenty of conservative people here and although I may not agree with many of their views I do feel like I have been treated well by most of them on a personal level.","That's the face we showing to outsiders 'turkish hospitality'. But things changes on the other side. ","You're a European (Turkey desperately wants to join the EU) and a cultural outsider; you must know you're treated differently.  The question is not how EU cultural outsider women are treated, but how non-EU women are treated; Turkish and regional foreign working women.  \nI'm sure you've interacted with Turkish and regional foreign working women, do their experiences mirror yours?  ","Oh course I am aware of the differences, and I took care to note that my experience will not be the same as that of many Turkish women growing up in a culture that can be restricting.  Equally, I know many Turkish women who come from a background that treats them in a similar way to many EU citizens based on their gender and I think it is naive to assume that European cultures don't treat their women differently to their men either.  \n\nTo that end, there is a whole spectrum of treatment.  As an educated female in a city, who is relatively wealthy by Turkish standards, I have found that most Turkish women with the same 'status' have similar experiences to mine. I live in Ankara, where it is possible to meet quite a large cross section of society including the sisters of my male colleagues who come from more conservative parts of the country.  I can't say what happens in these people's family homes etc, but I can say that people are very protective of their families and that there is a community collectiveness which we do not have in my own country.  If a young woman is being irritated by a begging child on the street, for example, an older person will frequently tell that child to leave them alone.  I have seen staff in bars ask women if a man is bothering them, not wanting her to feel unsafe.  \n\nAlso, don't think that Turkey's desperation to join the EU is going to be reflected in the actions of its citizens.  Many people here absolutely despise the EU and what it is imposing on Turkey.  Ask a range of Turks what they think about Europe and the answers will vary hugely, from support (usually desire for visa-free travel) to the opinion that they are being exploited by the organisation.\n\nIn central Istanbul I would get the tourist treatment, and many people and families would treat me extra nicely because they want to show the best of their country to visitors, but in this city it is rare that I would receive special treatment because I live here like everyone else.  The main difference is what happens behind closed doors.","LOL. You actually think people treated her nice BECAUSE SHE IS A EU-CITIZEN? Believe me, most of the Turkish people don't even care about joining the EU.","Interesting. I frequently hear the exact opposite.","The cities and coastal parts of Turkey are quite progressive and can be considered the same as western countries. It's the inland which is far more conservative, uneducated and religious and is the main source of the Erdogan's support. As a woman you can visit Istanbul, Antalya and other coastal cities and it would feel no different from a Western city.","That's not entirely true.  There's still a lot of verbal harassment during the day, and entitled new money assholes harassing you when you go out at night.\n\nYou can certainly find that anywhere else, but imo it's more common in Turkey.  I'd say it feels no different from any other country near the Mediterranean.  The same can go for Italy/France/Spain.","That's actually helping. Turkey highly relays on tourism, and the bullshit that criminal is pulling of everyday scares many, many people away. I personally know a couple of people who considered going on vacation there, or even had trips planned. Well not anymore.","It's a beautiful country and a majority are good people","I'm sure - but I'm not going to give tourist dollars to that arrogant shitheel's regime.","Just have to make sure your kid doesn't tweet #FuckErdogan and get your entire family arrested...","Istanbul is one of the most amazing cities I've ever seen though. So I highly recommend visiting ","Is Erdogan that guy who looks like that LOTR character w the small penis?","Where are you getting your movies from?","The West should be treating Turkey like a pariah while Erdogan is in charge.

And guess what Ebru said about her? \n\n&gt; ‚ÄòWat heb je daar te zoeken? Ga weg?! Als je journalist bent in Turkije w√©√©t je dat je de kans loopt achter de tralies te verdwijnen‚Äô, zegt Metro-columniste Ebru Umar bij Dit is de Dag. Dat zijn de Koerden m√≠j niet waard.\n\n&gt; Ebru Umar vindt dat de Nederlandse journaliste in Turkije Fr√©derike Geerdink haar celstraf min of meer over zichzelf afroept. Umar: ‚ÄòWereldwijd staat Turkije bovenaan met het oppakken van journalisten. Door je in dit soort gebieden te begeven, loop je dit risico.‚Äô\n\nI'll translate if you'd like: 'What're you doing in Turkey? Get out?! If you're a journalist in Turkey, you *know* that you run the risk of getting jailed' says Ebru Umar. 'The kurds aren't worth that for me'. \n\nEbru Umar thinks the Dutch Journalist Geerdink more or less asked for it. Umar: 'worldwide Turkey is on the top of the lists in jailing journalists. By being present in such areas, you run this risk'.\n\nThis kind of tells you what kind of a bs journalist Ebru is. It's one thing to say 'I'm scared to do proper journalism myself', which is fine, everyone gets that. It's another to say 'fuck your principles, it's your own fault this happened, you knew the risks so you should've just not done journalism!' -- No journalist worth his salt would ever imply something like that second statement.\n\nBut my point is, Ebru very much knew this would happen. I can't imagine she was so naive to think that, right when Turkey is making headlines, when there's anti-Turkey sentiment, when Turkey's in the media for prosecuting a German comedian, that she can make some nazi-party references about Erdogan while or shortly before visiting Turkey, and expect no consequences. So yes, the narrative that she fully knew the consequences makes a lot of sense. And yes, of course it benefits her career greatly.\n\nStill, as much as I hate her I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt unless there's more evidence.

I'd say yes.","This should be on top","Eh, how did *she* do this?","I just want to point out Erdogan is an asshat, but it's not like he's eroded Turkey's freedom of speech laws.

She writes garbage opinion columns for a free newspaper that people can pick up at train stations.\n* Criticism of Erdogan is giving her a bit too much credit. It's usually just uneducated and sensationalist hate spewing towards him.

That is the only reason she has any sort of following at all, because she just loves making other Dutch-Turks and other minorities in the Netherlands look like backwards idiots in order to get appreciation from racist/biased Dutch people. The only reason the Turkish part of her nationality/ethnicity is left out now is because she is riding the hate train towards non-Western Dutch citizens.\n* She breaks the laws in Turkey so she gets arrested, big deal. You can disagree with a law but that doesn't mean you have the right to break it or that a country doesn't have the right to act upon it.\n* She is a diehard Atat√ºrk supporter, and one could argue that Atat√ºrk was a dictator in his own right and social media in Turkey has been silenced plenty of times over satires or criticism of Atat√ºrk as well. Insulting Atat√ºrk can result in up to 6 years in prison in Turkey. In other words, she's a hypocrite at best. ","You heard it here first people! She's a bad person and it's Turkish law, so its okay a Dutch citizen is arrested for having an opinion!","It's ok for a Dutch citizen to get arrested for breaking the Turkish law in Turkey. She's not arrested for having an opinion, that's what you people don't seem to understand. There's opposition parties in Turkey and their members who literally criticize Erdogan and his party on a daily basis and they are not getting arrested now are they? The difference is that they actually criticize him constructively and this woman is just publicly insulting him to appeal to bigoted Dutch people and other Erdogan haters alike. She got what was coming to her. Don't go to a country where you are actively breaking the law on a regular basis and expect to get away with it. ","So what about homosexuals in Saudi Arabia, who are tortured then executed for breaking SA law? Or the law in Zimbabwe, where it is illegal for whites to own land? Should all of that be accepted just because 'its the law'? \n\nAlso who decides what is insulting and what is constructive criticism? Erdogan? Seems awfully totalitarian.\n\nEdit: I understand it's to be expected she got arrested, considering the current climate in Turkey, but I don't think that makes it okay.\n\nEdit 2: Also, \"Erdogan haters\"? You realise we are talking about a person who literally considers the governmental structure of Hitler's Germany (a fascist dictatorship) a good example of how things should be done? Is hating a person like that even a bad thing?","As I mentioned in my original post, just because you disagree with a law doesn't mean you should break it. Criticize the law and try to get it changed first, but don't break it in the meanwhile, that's just utterly stupid and asking for problems. And yes that includes the examples you mentioned. \n\nYou can find it horrible that she got arrested for breaking this law because you disagree with the existence of the law in the first place, but that doesn't mean what she did was right. Every country has the right to create their own laws and enforce them. Don't agree with those laws? Then don't freaking visit said countries and actively keep breaking their laws (while you're there) like this woman was doing while those laws are still being enforced. \n\nAs for who decides what's constructive criticism and what's straight up insulting and defamation, that's up to the Turkish court to decide. But I can tell you that spamming \"#fuckerdogan\" or telling people to \"go fuck themselves and give Erdogan a good fucking while they're at it\" is probably not going to be considered constructive criticism by any person with a functioning brain. ","Okay I understand your perspective. Breaking the law is stupid, no matter how much you disagree with the law, because it's a provocation and it makes you a target.

The backlash caused by this arrest proved I'm not the only one who thinks it is.

Because the news article gives a one sided view when in reality it's not that one sided at all. Calling her a journalist is giving her too much credit, calling her a critic of Erdogan is as well, and saying she's Dutch is also a half truth. \"Dutch-Turkish anti-Erdogan columnist arrested in Turkey\" would be a far more accurate headline. Her being a stereotypical Atat√ºrk supporter is also relevant because she writes a column when it's about the Turkish government asking Turkish citizens to report insults and mocking of Erdogan, but whenever there were lawsuits about people insulting Atat√ºrk or social media being taken down in Turkey because of insults towards Atat√ºrk, she never said anything about it. That means that she is a hypocrite, and only sees a problem with Turkish law when it aids someone she doesn't like but when it's putting people in jail or fining them for insulting her personal hero she's suspiciously silent. My point is that you should hardly feel sorry for her.\n\nThere's also no law that puts people in prison for criticizing elected leadership. There's one that punishes people for outright insulting the Turkish head of state, just like there's one that's one against insulting the Turkish nation and so on. That's their law and they have every right to have such a law. The West needs to stop trying to decide for the rest of the world what they should be doing, it just makes matters worse. If the Turkish nation wants to get rid of that law, they will. So far it looks like the majority is fine with it.\n\nAs for the NATO suggestion, that's just ridiculous. Turkey is probably the most vital NATO member after the US, and kicking them out just because they want to enforce their defamation laws is utterly ridiculous. Western countries also have limits on free speech. Go and deny the Holocaust or voice support for Nazism in Germany and see how long your freedom of speech lasts over there. ","Let me tell you this as a Belgian-Turk. 95% of the Turks are dumb. Maybe not dumb, but they ignore rational thoughts. But still, one would rather educate than hate.","Ok ISIS supporter.","Very classy. Don't mindlessly ride the Erdogan hate train == ISIS supporter. ","Erdogan wants an official Islamic government and there is evidence of him supporting ISIS so yea you sound like an ISIS supporter yourself.","That's some sound reasoning. I didn't even support Erdogan in my comment, I just explained how I didn't feel bad or sympathetic towards this so called journalist because she's actively breaking the Turkish law and got arrested for it. I didn't even say I agreed with the law (or Erdogan) for that matter. But sure, because I don't share the opinion that Western citizens should be able to go around the world and do whatever the hell they want and should be able to break all kinds of laws that Western culture disagrees with, I must be supporting ISIS. ","You seem to be in support of the law, a westerner (or anyone for that matter) should be able to go around the world and criticize leaders because no modern nation should have laws like that. Hopefully one day all societies have advanced that far but as long as Muslims control some societies I highly doubt it will. You're not even allowed to criticize or leave Islam in those nations. ","She's not criticizing a leader. She's just insulting him and defaming him. People need to learn the difference. The people in the opposition parties in Turkey criticize him, and they're doing just fine and get paid to do it. \n\nSo yes, I support a law which prohibits mindless and tasteless insulting of people on public platforms, no matter who they are. I would not support a law which prohibits all forms of criticism towards people (again, no matter who they are) but that's not the case here anyway. ","So you're against offensive jokes? I guess you never heard the sticks and stones line as a kid. You're part of the wahh words hurt group. Toughen up","People can make offensive jokes as long as the receiving party doesn't mind. As soon as they do, I wouldn't mind if there are repercussions for the people who make those jokes don't stop and continue with it relentlessly. Such \"jokes\" often just make the situation even worse and don't improve the situation at all. I'm in favor of having actual intellectual criticism of people rather than making a cartoon of them where they're fucking a random animal or whatsoever. Freedom of Speech is useless if it just devolves into tasteless insults. ","so if someone gets their feelings hurt then it should be illegal? hahaha ","You support suppression of free speech - you said so yourself - and you expect anyone to take your arguments seriously? ","Imagine it's the other way around. The Middle East is the superpower in the world and they go and meddle in Western affairs and keep telling them it's ridiculous that you can just insult people freely and that people should have the right to not be insulted. See how stupid it is? Let them decide for themselves what they want. Freedom of Speech has legal limits in every country, including western ones, and they can decide themselves where they want to put those limits. If they want to limit it more to where it no longer protects tastelessly insulting people, then all power to them. \n\nWe in the West have forgotten that just as much as people have the right to freedom of speech, people should also have the right to be and feel insulted. It's ridiculous that everyone is just expected to shrug everything off for the sake of \"freedom of speech\". **Everyone** has limits, western people included. Whether there should be laws in place to prevent that, is a different discussion. The matter of fact is that in some countries such laws are already in place and agreed upon, and if you visit such countries you have to abide to them. If you don't, then don't complain you get into trouble. ","As a turk, that is looking for controversial oppinions I thank you.\nThe problem with turkish politics is, that nobody really has a neutral point of view or is providing arguments against and for the turkish government.

Democracy sucks, eh?\n\nLiberals preach about democracy and \"majority rule\" yet when they see it applied, they always complain. Lmfaooo","You don't understand what is going on here. Real democracy is good. The complaint isn't about the process or even the result of that process. It has nothing to do with that. It is all about the fact that after getting elected Erdogan is usurping authority to implement an authoritarian style of rule. He used democracy to get into power and is now leading the country towards the opposite of democracy in order to satisfy the desires of the conservative wing of the population. The liberals that you appear to dislike simply want democracy to remain the rule of the land. You are essentially taunting the people that want the country to remain democratic, free and fair.","Those liberals you see, simply hate muslims though. Before Erdogan was elected, you were not able to wear a hijab and enter universities. You were also not allowed to wear hijab as a teacher. \n\nIf you ask those \"liberals\", what they think of this, you know what they will say? Those with hijab should not be anywhere near school, especially not being a teacher either. It is not just teacher though, they also don't want them at government jobs. Those with hijab would therefore wear wigs just to teach at schools.\n\nCertainly not all liberals think like this, however majority of them do. ","I'm not sure I quite understand what you say. Not allowing those who wear hijab to be teachers is a big discrimination. However, saying that a teacher shouldn't wear a hijab while she is at school teaching children is not hate towards muslims. (or towards religion since I guess similar law applies to other religious outfits)\n\nIt is just saying that school should not be about religion.","How is it not hate? What a teacher wears has no correlation to the subject they teach in a class. Just because I'm a Muslim, doesn't mean I'm going to talk about Islam during a class and I shouldn't, because that's not what I'm in that class for. \n\nSchool should not be about religion and I agree, but how does being a Muslim woman who wears a hijab have any relation to this?\n\nDoes that mean any teachers who have a religion shouldn't be teaching? A Christian man/woman can teach, a Buddhist man/woman can teach, a Muslim man can teach, but a Muslim woman who wears a hijab can't teach? Just because what she wears is more obvious than other religions? \n\nAlso, you skipped most parts of what I said. Not allowing woman who wear hijab to learn in school, not allowing them to do government jobs, isn't that discrimination? Isn't that hate? ","&gt; Does that mean any teachers who have a religion shouldn't be teaching? A Christian man/woman can teach, a Buddhist man/woman can teach, a Muslim man can teach, but a Muslim woman who wears a hijab can't teach? Just because what she wears is more obvious than other religions?\n\nI think a christian woman wearing [this kind of outfit](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/verticale-d-une-nonne-13721166.jpg) won't be allowed to teach, attend university or have a government job. If that is not the case and the law only targets muslim it is discriminatory and infuriating.\n\n&gt; Also, you skipped most parts of what I said. Not allowing woman who wear hijab to learn in school, not allowing them to do government jobs, isn't that discrimination? Isn't that hate?\n\nI personally think you should be able to wear any kind of outfit (with some exceptions such as full nudity, full cover, discriminatory words for example) as a teacher, to attend university or as a government employee But I think it is debatable and it is not a measure against muslims. This measure won't prevent muslims from being good muslims. They are already some exceptions were you don't have to follow all the rules and still have a strong faith. It about saying that is some places you shouldn't show or highlight the religion you are following (similar to when people have to wear a uniform) to lower to social pressure on some people.","I do not believe they hate muslims. It's just that many of the ideals that liberals support are not ideals that conservatives (especially religious conservatives) support. That's not hate... that's disagreement. As a liberal I would say that a muslim teacher should be allowed to wear hijab, even in the classroom. How many muslim conservatives would take such a stance regarding a liberal atheist?\n\nThat same teacher, however, would need to teach in a way that did not promote her religion. She would need to accept and tolerate things that I suspect someone inclined to wear hijab might find unacceptable. Can she teach science in a way that does not bow to islamic teachings? Can she discuss religions of the world in an even and open manner? Can she accept that an atheist student or teacher is not wrong or bad and should be treated as equally and respectfully as an imam? If she can do this I do not think most liberals would mind her following her religion in the manner she chooses. ","It is hate. If I wore a hijab and you don't allow me to learn in classes, teach in schools, or do government jobs, are you not hating me? You're telling me, we don't allow what you wear in here, even if it has no correlation to any of the above things. \n\nSince when did muslim conservatives ban a liberal atheist from teaching in classes? Since when they did they voice such opinions? The answer is, they didn't. But majority of the liberals voiced such opinions, they didn't allow woman with hijab to learn in schools, to teach in schools, to do government jobs. Heck, if you were a man teaching in school and they found out that you had a wife who wore a hijab, they would find excuses to kick you out or to never promote you.  \n\nYou do know you don't become a teacher just like that right? They go through classes and have to pass various tests to become one. Only by passing so they can teach. So why should what they wear have any relation to this? If they were to answer those tests in a way which promotes their religion, then they wouldn't pass would they? No, they passed because they didn't bring religion into this, they simply state the facts and focus on the subject. \n\nLook at Canada, they have woman who are teachers who wear a hijab. Even American has them. If they couldn't teach without involving religion, obviously they would not be teachers right? Look at Turkey now, they have women who are teachers while wearing hijab, and they teach without involving religion into the subject they're teaching. Doesn't this mean they're capable of being teachers? So, then why should we ban them? ","All I can say is that I am a liberal atheist that supports letting teachers, students, government workers or whoever wear whatever their religion dictates without discrimination. I completely agree that you are correct with everything you are concerned with. That is not hate. \n\nI can only speculate that liberals opposed to such things are afraid of something. Perhaps if it could be made clear that they have nothing to fear, they would change.","So when my dad who was a teacher at a university in Turkey for 5 years, was found to have a wife wearing hijab, and got kicked out for it with the reason being \"bad teacher\" while none of his students agreed to that statement, was that not hate? \n\nWhen he started teaching at another university, for 10 years they didn't let him advance after learning he had a wife who wore a hijab, even though he had a PhD under his belt, and once again, students that loved him, was that not hate? \n\nHe watched all those younger than him, those who had students that didn't really like the way they thought, become a professor in merely few years, while he stayed associate professor for 10 years. \n\nMy mother was not allowed inside the university to bring him some food, the guards didn't let her in. I had to bring it myself as a little kid while she waited outside. What were they afraid of? A weak woman who wears a hijab killing people, beating people, recklessly trashing around, going to random strangers and preaching about her religion? More than half the country's women wore a hijab at the time, or possibly more, yet they were afraid of them? What's the point of being a country when you're afraid of your own citizens and discriminate against them.\n\nLook, you may be a liberal atheist who doesn't discriminate or hate Muslims, but many others are not like you and I wish they were. I'm not sure about other countries, but in Turkey that is generally the case. ","I think that is very unfortunate. I would fight against such discrimination, myself. I'm sorry your family had to face that sort of treatment... it was not right.","&gt; Democracy sucks, eh?\n\nIt does actually.

Honestly, if someone on the street was harassing me, I do believe that it is much more likely that someone in Turkey would come to my defence than someone in the UK would.  That goes for both cosmopolitan cities and rural conservative areas.  This was all framed in the context of me being an outsider rather than someone who is embedded in the culture and was in response to someone who said they, as a female, were put off travelling here.  \n\nMy point was also that it is wise not to push the dichotomy where a western european country is an enlightened haven for females, because in my experience this is far from being the case.

I am not sure if/when the law will catch up; it is true that there are quite a few laws in place (also constitutional laws, in many countries) that constrain freedom of speech.

Last night was actually the first time a guy on the street approached me and would not leave, but as soon as we neared my bus stop he left because there were a load of people there and someone would have told him to fuck off and leave the lady alone.  \n\nIt's not my ideal treatment, but in Turkey there is still a notion of chivalry and treating women in a certain way.  I would rather be treated as an equal, but it's certainly preferable to the way it was for me in Spain.  I feel respected rather than objectified.\n\nThat is not in any way to suggest that there are not problems in Turkey for many local women and it would be doing them a disservice to assume that is the case; I just want to provide some perspective and illustrate something that I know other women have found here too.  It should also be noted that for some women, the cultural restrictions are much greater and that there is of course more to it than being able to walk down the street without being harassed.     ","You tell it like Spain is an African country, were blondes are seen like some kind of a unicorn.

Given the hugely different reactions when I told people that I was moving to these places, I thought it might provide a perspective that challenged the views of many people in the west.\n\nI agree that there are many cultural problems in the way some women are treated in Turkey.  There are also many women who are not subject to this kind of treatment and oppression.  I wish Turkey had greater female representation, I wish there was higher female participation in the labour market, I wish the laws that are in place to protect women from domestic abuse would be implemented more rigorously.  At the same time, there was an installation in the city in Spain where I lived that showed a count of the number of women who had been killed by domestic violence each year.  I don't think those Spanish women were being treated as first class citizens or that they were enjoying a culture of equality either.\n\nFrom the start I said I was discussing my treatment as a foreigner living in these countries as a response to someone saying she wouldn't visit as a woman.","You think this is bad? \n\nThere is a \"Charitable foundation\" called Ensar in Turkey.

My hope is that by opening up an actual conversation (rather than the usual World News bullshit), people might actually go to the country and talk with Turkish people and understand the problems instead of perceiving it as an evil land full of Muslim monsters; at the same time, having more Turkish people exposed to a greater range of views will hopefully help promote greater understanding on that side too.\n\nI think the way that so many people just stand back and judge is completely counterproductive and that they need to move beyond their one-dimensional view of certain countries because it risks ending up with them being isolated to do all the shit that they want.\n\nAnyways, I hope you get an opportunity to move away.

The region saw several major Kurdish rebellions, including the Ko√ßkiri Rebellion of 1920 under the Ottomans, then successive insurrection under the Turkish state ‚Äì including the 1924 Sheikh Said Rebellion, the Republic of Ararat in 1927, and the 1937 Dersim Rebellion. All were forcefully put down by the authorities. The region was declared a closed military area from which foreigners were banned between 1925 and 1965.\n\n&gt;Turkey has historically feared that a Kurdish state in Northern Iraq would encourage and support Kurdish separatists in the adjacent Turkish provinces, and have therefore historically strongly opposed Kurdish independence in Iraq. However, following the chaos in Iraq after the US invasion, Turkey has increasingly worked with the de facto autonomous Kurds in Iraq.\n\n---\n\nI get that there's a level of self-reliance that's expected when we have the world's information at our fingertips with the internet, but if you're provided with the opportunity to teach, then embrace it, or say nothing and defer to someone else.\n\nAnti-intellectualism exists because of passive gestures like lmgtfy.

Following the death of his father in 2010, Cameron was left ¬£300,000 tax free as an inheritance. However, his mother also transferred two payments of ¬£100,000 to him in May and July 2011.","Turkey should not be in NATO.","Yeah, fuck their immense contributions and major role in helping achieve success during the Korean war.","Arresting journalists?

A 19 year old got arrested and charged with two felonies yesterday for making a similar comment about Trump.","This sounds so familiar...Oh yeah! \n\nJust make sure you're packin a hidden pistol so when the grenade attack fails, you can beat feet to hide and wait at a nearby restaurant to shoot him when his driver gets their car stuck in a muddy hole in the street a mere stone's throw from your table.","Congratulations on your official new dictator.","Is this the same Turkey who's citizens will soon have the same rights of travel and benefits as any other European citizen?","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1FVlS3zdhA","Then don't drive a car, take a more responsible form of transport.","When traffic collapses, public transportation also collapses because too many people try to use it at the same time.","Well he is democratically chosen, so many Turkish people seem to like it this way. ","That's far from the truth. Sure there is alot of akp support in rural areas, but it is also well known that election fraud runs rampant in Turkey.","I've personally met poor Turks who sold their votes for some food and coal.  They're so uneducated, they don't really understand what the significance is of what they're doing, just that they'll be well-fed and able to heat their house for the winter.","&gt; just that they'll be well-fed and able to heat their house for the winter.\n\nYou should've lectured them on how voting for what they believe in, even if their single votes won't change the election, is more important than making sure their family doesn't nearly starve. Of course they know what they're doing.","And what has the republican elite ruling class done for turkey's bottom 50% since 1925? Nothing. A single lump of coal has more value than the CHP. \n\nThe fact so many turks were in dire poverty before erdogan's economic miracle over the past decade proves the so called uneducated in turkey are far more intelligent than the lefty losers who ran the show unopposed during the 20th century","You assume the economic growth in Turkey has somehow improved the lives of the poor. It has not. The rich have simply gotten richer and now the government is no longer secular. Yeah the work erdogan has put in has really done wonders ","You are incorrect. There are many oecd reports that show large increases in median (as opposed to just mean) income. Not to mention vast improvements in health, education, and infrastructure including public transit which disproportionatly helps the poorest who lack private automobiles. ","There's even a lot of support for him from western Turks... don't underestimate their stupidity.","Most of them in the Netherlands vote for him as well. I saw people come to vote at my work with their cars draped in AKP banners.... in Holland.","Well western countries get the uneducated work force because they need laborers of that sort, not engineers and technicians. If you look at UAEs or Qatar's votes for instance, leftist parties get the majority over there, because what they need is qualified, educated workers.","That's because they don't live there and often have very nationalistic mindsets. So they are very sensitive for all the propaganda. It's funny because they are often more educated then the people who vote for him in turkey (where intellectuals and relatively educated people despise him).","Every American Turk I know hates Erdogodan. In fact if they were to talk about Turkey that would be the first topic","Sadly this is not the case in Western-Europe.. You tend to get the upper-echelon of migrants/refugees, it's harder to come to the US.\n\nWe even have two Erdogan supporters in our own parlement... Turkey's power in and over Europe is rapidly expanding, as can be seen by the recent deals. \n\nLast time Erdogan got more votes (in percentages) in the Netherlands, than he did in Turkey... Interesting times we're living in.","Wait.. People from the Netherlands voting in Turkish elections? ","Yeah welcome to the world of double passports","That's absolutely insane. You should only be able to vote in the place you reside in most. That's how it works in the U.S. for state elections. Wherever you are the majority of time is the only place you can vote ","I'm an ethnic turk born and raised in america and I support erdogan. If you actually believe in liberal democracy, I suggest you spend all of 10 minutes reading about life/politics in turkey before AKP came to power in 2002. Short version: religious persecution, prohibition of minority languages culture, military coups, 3rd world poverty (per capita GDP went from 2500-&gt;10000 under erdogan)\n\nOf course you will likely not bother reading anything and coming up with your own informed opinion. You will just parrot some other uniformed opinion you heard about an unfamiliar topic over the internet. \n\nAs you say, don't underestimate stupidity!","I know the military was undemocratic, but I believe this to be a necessity in Islamic countries. I'm a pragmatist, I'd rather have a secular dictatorship than Islamists running a country.\n\nYes he did well economically, but it's hard to say if the same wouldn't have happened without him. What is sure is that he's an Islamist, who's fucking with Europe while disabling any criticism in his own country... (as close to a dictatorship without officially being a dictatorship.)\n\nHe also seems rather close with ISIS and supports further islamization of Turkey... Just not my cup of tea. I've spoken to Turks on both ends of the spectrum, and I tend to get along a lot more with those that supported the Ataturk style of government.","As a liberal democrat, how do you expect me to respond to you? You admit erdogan isnt a real dictator but uses the LAW to do what he can to squelch critism from people like you who openly admit they would prefer a military dictatorship to his democratic rule.\n\nI consider erdogan an angel for his unbelievably tame response to the ataturk faction so far. As you say there are many turks who are openly for a military coup to replace him. If i were erdogan i would show far less restraint.\n\nHonest question: is there a logicial reason for erdogan and the actual democrats in this countey not to simply execute the supporters of 'ataturk style government'? You admit they are not interested in contesting elections and would rather impose their ideology and rule through a military dictatorship. Is there any point in dialogue with such unmasked fascists?","If you make laws that are unjust then it doesn't make it right to follow such a law, I value freedom of press and speech... Something Islam does not allow, since it's forbidden to criticize that religion.\n\nI don't like military dictatorships, but I prefer military dictatorships that protect minorities over a democratic Islamic nation that kills or forces them to leave. And since you can't have a democratic nation when you have Islam, since it'll eventually lead to the disappearance of all freedoms I prefer a dictatorship of the secular type.\n\nWhat you have with Erdogan is a dictatorship, but the Islamist type.. The worst you can have, it's heading for SA style government. \n\nLike I said I'm a pragmatist... And if you consider the response of Erdogan tame (dismantling of press, and jailing everybody who opposes him) then I wonder what you're doing in Amerika and why you haven't come back to your home country to work for this fantastic man.\n\nAlso liberal and Islamist don't match, so pick one: Erdogan supporter or liberal.","&gt; If you make laws that are unjust then it doesn't make it right to follow such a law, I value freedom of press and speech... Something Islam does not allow, since it's forbidden to criticize that religion.\n\nErdogan did not make these laws. They were written by the military dictators you like so much. Of course, when the secular dictators crushed freedom of press and speech (as they still do in Egypt for example), no one in the West complained.\n\n&gt;Something Islam does not allow, since it's forbidden to criticize that religion.\n\nIslam is no different than Christianity or Judaism -- all three are basically the same. Its just a matter of how strictly they are enforced in a country that matters. Europe under the Catholic Church was far less free than the Islamic world during that era. Ugandan Christians still routinely murder homosexuals. This is not a 'defense' of fundamentalist Islam -- only a clarification that it is no different than fundamentalist Christianity or Judaism.\n\n&gt;I don't like military dictatorships, but I prefer military dictatorships that protect minorities over a democratic Islamic nation that kills or forces them to leave.\n\nSo I guess you didn't know that Turkey's military dictators made it illegal to speak Kurdish? In fact, simply CALLING yourself a Kurd was enough to get you jailed. Women could not wear headscarves to public buildings including hospitals and schools/universities -- another assault on minority rights (religious in this case.)\n\n&gt;And since you can't have a democratic nation when you have Islam, since it'll eventually lead to the disappearance of all freedoms I prefer a dictatorship of the secular type.\n\nSo far freedoms are still increasing.\n\n&gt;What you have with Erdogan is a dictatorship, but the Islamist type.. The worst you can have, it's heading for SA style government.\n\nPeople have been saying this since 2002, so far it seems like the only thing we are heading towards is SA levels of wealth.\n\n&gt;Like I said I'm a pragmatist... And if you consider the response of Erdogan tame (dismantling of press, and jailing everybody who opposes him) then I wonder what you're doing in Amerika and why you haven't come back to your home country to work for this fantastic man.\n\nYou don't think he's behaving tame? I already told you what his predecessors did -- they 'disappeared' critical journalists the same way China and Russia do today. Jailing journalist makes you look bad in international statistics, if Erdogan was interested in being a dictator wouldn't he just have them disappeared? It would cost him literally nothing domestically -- I'd still vote him -- but Erdogan actually follows the EU treaties he signed.\n\nAs for me, I now split my time between the two countries. I'd be happy to work for Erdogan if he offered me a post in his government.\n\n&gt;Like I said I'm a pragmatist...\n\nYou don't even know what that word means. If you were a pragmatist you would support Erdogan. \n\nFrom what you've said so far, you seem more like a bigot than a so-called pragmatist. You think Muslims are not capable of democracy, so its better they stay poor, underdeveloped, and oppressed by secular elites that keep them under control.","&gt; Islam is no different than Christianity or Judaism -- all three of basically the same. Its just a matter of how strictly they are enforced in a country that matters.\n\nBack in the day yes, but unlike Judaism who're mostly intelligent people (many Jew's are only culturally so, atheistic Jews so to say)... And Christianity that went through a reform. Islam in practice does not allow for such interpretations, in it's current form it's by far the most dangerous religion out there. And there are no signs for change.\n\nEven most western-Muslims have backwards views incompatible with western-society... And will eventually force that society to submit to their will, hell we're doing it voluntarily or due to fear currently.\n\n&gt; So I guess you didn't know that Turkey's military dictators made it illegal to speak Kurdish? In fact, simply CALLING yourself a Kurd was enough to get you jailed.\n\nYes it wasn't perfect, but I think the direction it's heading now will be worse.\n\n&gt; Women could not wear headscarves to public buildings including hospitals and schools/universities -- another assault on minority rights (religious in this case.)\n\nI totally agree with the banning of all religious symbols from public buildings, especially if it's a symbol suppressing women. I also advocate banning halal-slaughter on the basis of animal-cruelty... Same goes for tax-exemptions and the foreign subsidies for religious buildings. Ban it all, ideally this would not be necessary but it is.","&gt; Back in the day yes, but unlike Judaism who're mostly intelligent people (many Jew's are only culturally so, atheistic Jews so to say)... And Christianity that went through a reform. Islam in practice does not allow for such interpretations, in it's current form it's by far the most dangerous religion out there. And there are no signs for change.\n\nWhat do you mean by 'most dangerous' religion? Even a 9/11 type event *per year* is only a few thousand casualties compared to the 30k+ that die in America and 85k+ in Europe every year in auto accidents alone. If you mean 'sensationalist' and 'headline grabbed' you are correct. But from a civilization point of view, Islam today is zero threat and has never been a lower threat. And this is assuming Islam *is* this crazy evil force you think it is. Of course in reality its just a hodge podge of cultural traditions, like every other religion.\n\n\n&gt;Even most western-Muslims have backwards views incompatible with western-society... And will eventually force that society to submit to their will, hell we're doing it voluntarily or due to fear currently.\n\nLol. If the West is really that weak (which it isn't, despite your Islamic Power Fetish) it really will fall and your internet debates won't save Western civilization.\n\n&gt;Yes it wasn't perfect, but I think the direction it's heading now will be worse.\n\nWorse for who? If an economically and militarily powerful Muslim-majority country scares you as a foreigner, I can at least respect your realpolitik point of view. But please don't preach to me about how much better Turks were with &lt;$2,500 in annual income and one party rule.\n\n&gt;I totally agree with the banning of all religious symbols from public buildings, especially if it's a symbol suppressing women. I also advocate banning halal-slaughter on the basis of animal-cruelty... Same goes for tax-exemptions and the foreign subsidies for religious buildings. Ban it all, ideally this would not be necessary but it is.\n\nSymbols don't suppress women. They're inanimate objects. My university halls in America had many veiled women, back when those same women would not have been allowed in a Turkish university.\n\nI'm actually against slaughtering animals under any circumstance on the basis of animal-cruelty. I think we should move towards a totally vegan civilization. The difference between you and me, however, is your inability to be objective. I want gradual, democratic progression towards veganism. You would rather point guns at people to impose your will. Fight the battle of ideas and win seats in your parliament. If you use guns to oppress people -- which by the way the West has and continues to do in the Muslim world, you will get blowback. If you want Islam to stop spreading in your country, convince the major Western powers to stop bombing Muslim countries.","You mean uneducated turkish people who migrated to Europe in the late 20th century, who are mostly from rural areas of Turkey?\nNo? Well I guess all of those mongolian bastards named turks are imbeciles /s\n\nIt must feel very good to be a shallow racist.","Where did I say that, are you denying that there is a lot of support (even more than in their home country)?\n\nI know both types... One allows their sons and daughters to date whomever they want, not wearing religious symbols etc. Perfectly integrated... Tend to support Ataturk's policies.\n\nThen you have the backwards idiots, who tend to have backwards children... Sadly we have a whole lot of those, and they tend to support Erdogan. However they were born here and therefor are western Turks? \n\nSo how can my statement be wrong/racist if it's factually correct?\n\n","Your comment seemed to indicate that no matter in what way a Turkish person is raised he is going to be a moronic erdogan supporter, even if they were born in Europe. I'm sorry if I misunderstood you but judging from the comment you replied to my deduction seems correct. Of course you didn't say what I mentioned literally. \n\nHowever, the subject that was being discussed is the support of Turkish people regarding to Erdoƒüan's policies. Erdoƒüan is supported by approximately 40 percent of Turkish people, and (again approximately) 60 percent of Turkish people doesn't like him if not hate him. \n\nBecause of the twisted electoral system in Turkey he can act as if 70-80 percent of country is supporting him. I'm saying that this is not true as a Turkish person. I'm saying that the immigrants you see in Europe are not the perfect sample of Turkish people. \n\nStill 40 percent of turkish people who support conservative policies is not nice. But hey, it may still said to be a positive demographic regarding to the people of middle east.\n\nAll of these facts are not enjoyable in arguments in worldnews though. Let's keep talking about how stupid Turkish people are and keep discussing scenarios of nuking Turkey. \n","Well what I wanted to say is that even if you grow up in Western-cities you can very well be an Erdogan supporter... So it seems not to be about rural-non-rural, it's something else (intelligence?).\n\nI know you have a whole lot of Ataturk supporters, but they seem to be losing the demographic power to have any chance to reverse the path Erdogan (with the help of the EU) set out to. \n\nI wish you still had a military that could take action, but Erdogan seems to have purged them all... I hope I'm wrong but the future doesn't look bright.","Just like every country in the world and if it was that significant why did he not get 362 or so he needed to change the constitution ","&gt; Just like every country in the world \n\nNope. Only the hugely corrupt ones","like the US election 2000?","It clearly happens in the US so let me rephrase it. Nearly every important country in the world ","No it doesn't. It might happen a tiny bit,  but not like it does in places like turkey,  Syria,  China,  Russia, etc. Countries like Germany,  the USA,  England,  Australia,  Canada don't have massive problems with voter fraud like in Turkey. \n\nThere is fuckery in the USA but it's just that. Gerrymandering is probably the biggest problem","\"Clearly\"? Wut? ","&gt;Nope. Only the hugely corrupt ones","There are plenty of important countries which don't have this level of corruption.","What are you talking about? Akp party members were caught in an ally burning ballots. You don't get that kind of blatant fraud in 1st world countries. Sure you might get the occasional sneaky fraud, but nothing that stupid.","He's popular, but I don't think that he has true majority support. It's just that his opponents are splitting the opposition among themselves. ","Like nearly every country in the world ","Absolutely, but this is still often overlooked. Sometimes people make it seem that the entire population of turkey can't help but touch themselves fondly when the name 'Erdogan' is heard, while in reality, not *everyone* in turkey does so.","Clientalism is rampant, so I am not sure that really counts as a \"democratic\" result. Also no free press.\n \nThey seem to better like the free coals and bread than the president they voted for.","Incredibly far from the truth as Pm said. My girlfriend is turkish and lives/works in london and she said most turks cant stand Erogden. But he's snuck in over time for people too late to realise, and then gains support from fanatics who have a bizzare dream of the \"days of old\" of the Ottoman Empire. So its a right old mess. Ironic side fact the  remaining bloodline of the ottomans want democracy and the fanatics want dicatorship. \n\nEdit: grammar","Zealous nationalism is a hell of a drug. Trump's making the same appeal. Mussoliniism is making a comeback.","/r/InsultingErdogan","Pretty sure he's another dictator installed by the USA ","American presidents are democratically chosen as well, are we going to close a blind eye to the fact that every single one has had serious complaints leveled against them, some to the extent where they'd have to step down?","No they are not. Citizens votes are represented in the electoral college.","Good.. you dont go to another country and break there low.. i hope she rot in jail..","Hang on while I break out my cryptograph","Yes, breaking someone's low is greatly disrespectful.  Do they not have any respect for the 'drop'?","Don't overestimate the Turkish people here. The ones who are on Reddit probably don't like Erdogan but he's quite popular generally speaking and they keep voting for him. The Turks as a whole clearly prefer someone like him to lead the country.","[Deleted this because it was stupid]\n\nFor real though, our Prime minister (the Netherlands) has literally said that everyone can file a complaint if they feel critized and that Erdogan is free to do so in the Netherlands. So he's also taking no stance at it :/\n\nNo wonder why \"extreme right\" is rising all over Europe.","Well, he is Technically right. So what is he supposed to do? It currebtly is the law even in our country.","Or a great way to raise funds like how many municipalities abuse the ticketing of minor infractions. "]]}
