","\"Internet customers in the UK are prohibited from accessing a range of web sites by default, because they have their Internet access filtered by their ISPs. The filtering program has applied to new ISP customers since the end of 2013, and has been extended to existing users on a rolling basis. A voluntary code of practice agreed by all four major ISPs[8] means that customers have to 'opt out' of the ISP filtering to gain access to the blocked content.[9] However, the complex nature of the active monitoring systems means that users cannot usually opt out of the monitoring and re-routing of their data traffic, something which may render their data security vulnerable. The range of content blocked by ISPs can be varied over time.[10] Categories blocked across the major ISPs include: Dating, Drugs, Alcohol and Tobacco, File sharing, Gambling, Games, Pornography, Nudity, Social networking, Suicide and Self-harm, Weapons and violence, Obscenity, Criminal Skills, Hate, Media Streaming, Fashion and Beauty, Gore, Cyberbullying, Hacking and Web-blocking circumvention tools.\"\n\nYou can technically opt-out if you're an adult.

It sounds like 90% of the internet is blocked.","IIRC you're given options to decide what exactly you want to block, like a firewall of sorts. Porn/nudity I believe is blocked by default if you don't say anything to your ISP. But from a previous article I read, the ISPs are suppose to notify you if a filter is going into effect and what do you want to do about it (for customers prior to 2013).

David Cameron first announced such legislation in July 2013[31][32] but default filtering was rejected at the September 2013 conference of the Liberal Democrats (the Coalition Government's minor partner)[33] and no Government legislation to this effect occurred during the 2010-15 Parliament.\"\n\n[Another says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_blocking_in_the_United_Kingdom#Mobile_Internet_blocking): \"All major UK [mobile] operators now voluntarily filter content by default.\"\n","&gt;They can't really block them as so many businesses rely on them.\n\nThats actually a good reason **to** block them -- so you can upsell people who just want to work from home on overpriced 'business packages' that they should not need.","Mothers are worthless.","Literally all hitlers.\n\n","\"wow thats what its like in america?? haha us british gentlemen have it *SO* much better here!\" ","The nanny state at its finest!","Fuck that shit.

Even if you opt out, you are stuck with the overhead of a few table lookups on giant tables (which likely aren't in an optimized SQL database at ALL).

The adult section isn't just nudie mags, it's anything that they deem to be offensive or bad in any way, including a lot of stuff you think is perfectly fine and innocent.  The adult section is clearly labeled but is right there with everything else and there is no stigma attached to going into it, because everybody knows the library is overzealous in what they label \"adult\".\n\nThat's the internet.  You can access anything and everything, and you are perfectly capable of deciding what you don't want to see, and you usually know ahead of time based on the link description or other factors, about what types of stuff you'll find.\n\nNow imagine the library doesn't just move the adult section, they hide it behind the counter, and video record you, and log each access, and you just feel awkward going in.  And lots of people come in and don't even know that it's there and so they don't even know to ask about it.  They are blocked from seeing information without knowing.  And less people go browsing there because it just feels more dirty to do it now.\n\nThat is a fundamental change in behavior that was created by the censorship.  Before that, people browsed freely and didn't think twice.  Now they are missing information, sometimes without knowing it, and when they find out and want to access it, they are burdened and recorded and made to feel like it's somehow different and somehow wrong.\n\nIt is a *chilling effect* on how you think and act.\n\nIn an opt-in system, the *default* is freedom, the ability to access what you want without burden or hassle or shame, you are choosing to place restrictions upon yourself for your own benefit, because you are an adult capable of making your own decisions.  In an opt-out system, you are treated as a child and that needs to be cared for, and it is specifically designed to make the social taboo and default be that access to this content is not appropriate.  It is control and manipulation.","Why do you think the internet should be treated differently from the real world?","First, I'm curious where in my post I make any points that require the internet be different from the real word.  I disagree with a lot of real world censorship as well.\n\nThat said, you are correct, and I do think the internet should be treated differently, because it fundamentally *is* different.  The internet has the ability to be even *more* open and free than the real world, and even though that comes with some bad things, on the whole, it's a HUGE net benefit to society at large.\n\nBad people will always use technology to do bad things, but that doesn't make the tech bad, and it also doesn't mean we shouldn't still have unfettered access to that tech -- the bad people may just be a hit we take because the benefit of the tech is so enormous.\n\nSoftware like Tor for example enables people to run hidden services and to browse the web anonymously, and of course a lot of bad people use that for doing bad things.  But it also enables people in repressive countries to secretly communicate and contact journalists and have a safe area they can communicate.  I think that's an acceptable tradeoff and that the good outweighs the bad.","&gt; First, I'm curious where in my post I make any points that require the internet be different from the real word.\n\nI inferred it. Hey it's late here. You make some good points. But at the end of the day I'm just disagreeing with you about the fundamental issue that I don't see an opt out filter on your internet that is part of the sign up process as a big deal. I also have no issues if the government want to proactively try and remove illegal content from the net such as illegal porn or the ability to buy services or goods that are illegal in the real world. The internet shouldn't be above the law imo and if something requires id or a license or is illegal in the real world then the same rules should apply to those partcular items or activities on the net as well.\n\n Anyway we're in danger of going off on a massive tangent here that I don't want to get involved in. As a whole I'm against censorship in the media and online. Your points about repressive countries censoring content and communication is spot on.  I just don't think comparing the internet in somewhere like north korea is at all comparable to an opt out porn filter that is set as part of the sign up process with your ISP. I just think we just have different opinions on where the line is and I don't consider an opt out filter that big a deal in principal. \n\nIf it helps explain my position a bit better if the filter was mandatory AND you couldn't opt out then I'd have issues. Even more so if non illegal \\ age restricted items were filtered or items of political sensitivity that doesn't fit the current narrative. I think it's important for me to reiterate that I'm arguing in favor for an opt out porn filter that you can opt out at sign up with your ISP. I'm not arguing in favor of becoming some sort of North Korean \\ Chinese black out on anything the government doesn't want you to know about which I'm guessing where a lot of the fear in this topic is coming from.","I certainly understand your views, and I also know I'm a bit die-hard all or nothing about it.  I have a great fear of the first steps of censorship slipping down that slippery slope at a very fast rate, and on top of that I lean more heavily on the \"all speech even hate speech and other horribleness should be allowed\" side of things, so even \"reasonable\" things often aren't acceptable to me.  And of course, content blocking, even if you can opt-out, I obviously don't care for.  (Since you can always opt-out by simply not visiting the site to begin with.  Have you ever typed a URL you wanted to visit and then been blocked and *not* been annoyed?  If you wanted to not see the site, you wouldn't have tried to visit it!)  I strongly feel the default needs to be free and open and then you must opt-in for censorship.\n\nBut your views are completely understandable and perfectly fair.","I'm not sure why I'm getting down voted for this.

My friend is my fraternity brother from college and at the time of the story was a fairly high ranking civilian contractor for the military that works on an American base.  About 2 years before the day of the story, he was cleaning up his kids playroom and had extra model clay and thought it would be a random idea to make a fake looking bomb with red curly wires, a clock, etc.  This was of course before 9/11 because as much as an idiot as my friend is, he would never think of doing this in present times.  Anyway, he had brought it to work to show his friends (he is a scientist and thought his friends would get a kick out of it).   He threw it in his desk and ultimately forgot about it.  \n\nOK so fast forward a few years later and my friend gets promoted to an even higher post.  He is cleaning out his desk and boxing things up and heads out to lunch off base.\n\nYou know where this is going.  He gets back to base and at the vehicle checkpoint to enter base there is a swarm of military police.  Upon showing his ID the MPs swarm his car (he is with 3 or 4 other people) and they tell him, with hands on guns but still holstered, \"sir you need to come with us\".\n\nMy friend tells me he shits a brick because he has no idea wtf is going on, and the MPs drive him in a jeep across base and as they approach his lab he sees fire engines, hazmat team, police, and the entire building and surrounding buildings evacuated.  All of a sudden it hits him.  He remembered unpacking the desk into boxes and left his \"toy\" visible in an open box.\n\nHe starts explaining himself and at first nobody believes him.  But ultimately the situation deescalates and returns to normal.\n\nThe next day, my friend is called to the office of the Base Commander and I am told the Base Commander looked him in the eyes with doors closed, allowed my friend to tell his story,  and the response was a calm \"what the fuck is wrong with you?\"  He was told about the cost of the shut down, the back story of what had transpired, and told to never allow something like that to happen again.  The Base Commander left it at that, figuring my friend was an idiot but otherwise spared him.\n\nThe best part of this story is that my friend is brilliant.  He holds a PhD, was very high ranking at the base, and now some 20 years later has been promoted very very high up in the hierarchy.  But I knew him in college when we were stupid and before he was a high ranking important dude.   So the story remains very special to me as a favorite.\n\nI remind him of this story at least once every 2 years.","That's part of the problem.  Being smart, intelligence- that has no bearing on whether or not the consequences are figured out.  \"Who in their right mind would build a real bomb?\"- but fakes they're OK.  Everyone will know it's a fake because real bombs don't look like they do on TV... etc.  \n\nI've no doubt your friend is definitely up there in the intelligence compartment- the 'common sense' or 'societal expectations' isn't a requirement for intelligence.  Fortunately the MPs weren't trigger happy...","18 Intelligence 6 Wisdom","The issue is in American culture if you're in charge you can't just say \"I'm an expert on these things and I *made the executive decision* that the toy did not pose a threat.\" ","Or maybe smart people overestimate dumb people who in reality can't figure simple shit out.

They started knocking on other doors to see if anyone knew where I was located and my friend Al says yeah I know him. They explained about the beer and tried to give it to Al, who's only 20 and a naturally suspicious person. So he declined. They insisted. He declined again and they said they'd leave the beer there for me to pick up. \n\nSome time later I get a call from Al explaining a bunch of SPs are still trying to give him, an underage airman living in a dorm where you can't drink by order of the base commander, a case of beer.

They were Creationists, and they lived in the foothills. During our stay, a huge fire broke out 20 miles away and raged through the hills, wiping out neighborhoods in its path.\n\nAt one point, around 4:00 AM, the fire was getting so close so quickly that the police stormed through the neighborhood and made everyone evacuate. They pounded on doors and screamed through bullhorns: *\"Leave now! Do not pack luggage! Do not gather your pets!\"* They wanted everyone to leave RIGHT NOW.\n\nA minute later, I saw why...\n\nI ran out the door with my baby daughter in my arms, and the fire on the ridge line was *right there*, just behind the houses across the street. In the wall of flames were these tiny little dots on the ridge line. I had to look again to realize they were *firefighters* forming a line, in the thick of it, fighting that fire. The flames dwarfed them. They fought it for days. Some didn't make it out alive.\n\nDays later, we finally got news that our friends' neighborhood was spared. Our friends immediately bowed in prayer and thanked God. I thought to myself, how about thanking the firefighters? But I figured, hey, they're overjoyed and this is how they're expressing their monumental relief. Surely, they know who saved their home.\n\nWrong. Over the next two weeks, they told many friends and family about the ordeal on many occasions, and not ONCE did they thank the firefighters. It was always God. God wanted their house spared. God placed his hand down the center of their street and held back the fire. God refused to let the fire harm His worshippers (or rather, their house, since they were safely evacuated, thanks to the police).\n\nI finally opened my mouth and said \"Don't forget the firefighters.\" They looked at me with daggers. Instead of saying, yeah, true, let's give them due credit, their stance was \"Well who do you think guided them?\"\n\nARRGHHHH!!!","This damn wind got in my eyes...","Maybe it's glaucoma.

If you're religious god is everywhere and in everything, even doctors.","So if god made the doctors, didn't god also make her child blind in the first place?","That's not how they usually think of it but some people view bad things in life as God testing their resolve/god won't give me more than I can take etc. It's comforting for a lot of people to feel like there is something bigger than them out there.

I think they see it more like a guiding force that allows them to be as good as they are, not \"Oh, I'm just derping along in life and God is doing all the precise medicine for me.\"","Exactly. They see God as the being that gave them their intelligence and drive, gave them their access to school, etc. They aren't saying they didn't have to work for it. \"God helps them who help themselves\" sums up the attitude usually.

It holds no bearing in any real religious context other than to say that you're fucked or not fucked because of your own actions.","I didn't say it was a biblical quote, I said it was an attitude. The idea is that God won't just drop good fortune on you from the sky, but that he smiles upon those who go out and work for it.","This seems like a reasonable explanation for the phrase \"God did it\", but it's not necessarily how all people will understand it. That's the problem with it.","She wasn't speaking for all people. She's not a world leader or a diplomat, she's a low income woman from Brazil. She's just speaking to her beliefs and her view of the world.","Because God isn't as kind as people like to think he is, because if you read it, he wants to test us, not fan us and drop grapes in our mouths, and leaves nature to batter us.

What does that prove?","Good question...I could hazard a number of guesses, but I think \"selective thinking\" is strongly implicated in many ways.","I dont think that Christians believe that God does evil, but he lets things happen.  TBH, this is something I'm working on understanding.

Doctors in Brazil couldn't do the surgery, and somehow all these people banded together and got her and her child (who was previously blind, deaf, and unable to walk) and cured her!

She's probably not educated enough to know why the surgeries worked, so she sees the incredible results as God working through the doctors, people who donated, people that coordinated the travel, etc. People in this thread are looking at the world in an entirely different way than a devoutly religious and dubiously educated woman from Brazil is.

Or they chose to live that kind of life. \n\nAgain placebos or self fulfilling prophecy. \n\n","The all good/all powerful thing breaks down like this.\n\nAssume god is all-powerful. There is bad in this world; indeed, the universe tends towards death and destruction (google entropy). People die horrible deaths. Families are broken apart.\n\nA good example of this kind of thing is the disease Fatal Familial Insommnia. It runs in families genetically. When the child of one of these families turns ~15-18, the disease sets in.\n\nThen, they never, ever sleep again; their brain prevents them. No matter how pious, how extraordinary their belief, they gradually fall into a coma, and then die. There is no treatment.\n\nSo now, we have to question the motivations of an all-powerful god. He can, as an all powerful being, stop everything bad in the world. Sure, perhaps humans need some free will here and there, perhaps we set our own ways, but to have a genetic mark on child from birth that makes them die a horrible death? That is not a 'good' thing, and thus an all powerful god is not all good. However, God, supposedly, is a loving god.\n\nTherefore, he cannot be all powerful. \n\nRe; not praying to the correct god; In my book, a god that refuses to help those who believe in other gods, no matter their predicament or morality, is a pretty petty sort of god.","I have no idea of God.

You sound like someone who gets his political news from NowThis and NowThis Election.","The ideology that Trump follows and promotes is particularly dangerous and violent. There is nothing wrong with trying to stop that violence from happening by protesting inside the event. Peacefully protesting outside the event will get nothing done whatsoever. The kind of logic you follow to end violence is what allows violent ideologies to take hold. No one can stop Trump or fascism through peaceful protests. And I don't know what NowThis is but okay.","&gt;Peacefully protesting outside the event will get nothing done whatsoever\n\nNeither does protesting in the event. You have no right to protest on his property (private events, therefore his) and you're interrupting him and wasting his and everyone-else-there-to-listen-to-him's time. Haven't you figured out with all this violence and protesting you're just showing why people support him. And please, just go over this \"violent ideology\" with me because I'm pretty sure I haven't really heard anything from him about racial purity or hurting people.","&gt;You have no right to protest on his property\n\nSays who?\n\n&gt;you're interrupting him and wasting his and everyone-else-there-to-listen-to-him's time\n\nI know, that's a real crime. Just think of the horrors of that inconvenience!\n\n&gt;Haven't you figured out with all this violence and protesting you're just showing why people support him\n\nSo Trump supporters like Trump because some people don't want Trump and his ideology to have any power at all? I think they like him because they enjoy hearing xenophobic statements and hate anyone that is different than them. \n\n&gt;just go over this \"violent ideology\" with me because I'm pretty sure I haven't really heard anything from him about racial purity or hurting people\n\nDonald wants to ban nearly 1.6 billion people from entering the United States because he deems them all possibly terrorists. This is despite the fact that in the United States since 2001, twice as many terrorist attacks were by right-wing Americans than by Muslims according to [NAF](http://securitydata.newamerica.net/extremists/deadly-attacks.html). You'd think Donald would want to ban the most dangerous groups to keep America safe but no, he's simply Islamophobic.\n\nTrump finds Mexicans to be dangerous people also. I'm sure you already read his famous quote: [\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/16/full-text-donald-trump-announces-a-presidential-bid/) Mexicans are first and foremost rapists or criminals or smugglers to him. Sure, he thinks some may be good, but to say that Mexico is actively sending bad people into the United States is ludicrous. That's where his xenophobia comes into play. \n\nAnother thought, if Trump wanted to secure the borders wouldn't he also want a wall on the Canadian border? That may be a little racism although it could be argued.\n\nI think we can all agree that Trump is sexist, I don't even have to get into that.\n\nAll of these ideas are violent and promote the hatred and inequality of people of different religions, ethnicities, and sexes. As long as a person who strives for a magnitude of power promotes these ideas, they are a threat to the people whom will be affected negatively by the ideas and need to be resisted. I also am of the belief that capitalism is an oppressive and terrible economic system, which Donald is clearly a fan of considering his massive amount of wealth. ","&gt;Says who?\n\nSays him you dumb shit. His campaign manager tells EVERYONE to protest outside in the area reserved for peaceful protesting. His rallies are private property, therefore you are trespassing and infringing his rules and are allowed to be booted out.\n\n&gt;I know, that's a real crime. Just think of the horrors of that inconvenience!\n\nClassic. And you wonder why the protestors are booted out and told to fuck off.\n\n&gt;So Trump supporters like Trump because some people don't want Trump and his ideology to have any power at all? I think they like him because they enjoy hearing xenophobic statements and hate anyone that is different than them.\n\nYou're such a cuck it's unbelievable. \"hate anyone that is different than them,\" you have completely summarized left wing identity politics. Trump is popular because he doesn't bullshit things and people are becoming sick of the current political establishment.\n\n&gt;Trump finds Mexicans to be dangerous people also\n\nAbsolutely knew this would come up. First off, notice the line \"And some, I assume, are good people,\" meaning there are some who are probably good decent human beings (don't think I need to explain this). And did you know [80% of girls who cross the border illegally are raped by the men they travel with?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/central-america-migrants-rape_n_5806972.html). [How about some of the murder rates](http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/08/08/illegal-alien-crime-accounts-for-over-30-of-murders-in-some-states/) (I get it's Breibart, but the statistics aren't biased). Can't bullshit the facts. And I don't think I need to explain the massive drug trade across the Mexican border. There's no xenophobia here, just no ignorance towards the facts\n\n&gt;Donald wants to ban nearly 1.6 billion people from entering the United States because he deems them all possibly terrorists. This is despite the fact that in the United States since 2001, twice as many terrorist attacks were by right-wing Americans than by Muslims according to NAF. You'd think Donald would want to ban the most dangerous groups to keep America safe but no, he's simply Islamophobic.\n\nAnother thing I knew would come up. [America's population of muslims is integrated and very moderate compared to the world](http://www.meforum.org/4218/the-moderation-of-american-muslims). Of course there haven't been a lot of attacks. But have you seen Europe lately? Muslims are 23 times more likely to rape in Sweden, and [a crime involving a muslim immigrant happens practically everyday in some European country](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/01/29/migrant-crisis-live-wire/). Also, he never said banning Islam completely, he said banning Muslim entry, which is understandable considering how Europe, Africa, and the Middle East have gone haywire with Islamic radicalism and crime rates.\n\n&gt;I think we can all agree that Trump is sexist, I don't even have to get into that.\n\nActually, please go into that if you may. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/09/donald-trump-i-cherish-women/\n\n&gt;I also am of the belief that capitalism is an oppressive and terrible economic system.\n\nYeah, no it's not. Capitalism gives everyone the chance if they work hard enough. The whole point of a capitalist free market is that it forces businesses to compete against each other, and the harder, more efficient worker wins.\n\n\n\nhttp://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/conrad-black-in-defence-of-donald-trump\n\nhttp://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/conrad-black-dont-underestimate-donald-he-will-win\n\nI suggest you read these to their full lengths.","&gt;You're such a cuck it's unbelievable\n\nSpotted the reactionary alt-right! You really come off as such an asshole when your go to insult in an argument is cuck.\n\n&gt;Trump is popular because he doesn't bullshit things and people are becoming sick of the current political establishment\n\n\"he doesn't bullshit things\" reminds me of phrases like \"He speaks the truth\" when talking about Trump because they mean nothing. Trump oversimplifies issues to black and white. He is just like every single neoconservative except he cannot be controlled by the country he runs. He holds the same beliefs as the rest of the establishment. \n\n&gt;just no ignorance towards the facts\n\nBut there is an ignorance towards how to use those facts. When things like crossing the border or smuggling drugs are illegal, the only people who are willing to cross the border or smuggle drugs are poor people. They need money and or a better life and are willing to do those things because they have no other choice. With crime and poverty comes a lack of education which is the reason why the rape rate is so high and why the murder rate is so high. People who rape and murder are products of an improper education, improper mental healthcare, and poverty.\n\n&gt;Muslims are 23 times more likely to rape in Sweden, and a crime involving a muslim immigrant happens practically everyday in some European country\n\nLike in the response to your statistics about illegal immigrants, the Muslim people who enter Sweden are products of their environment and if you can't tell, the Middle East isn't a great place to live, just like Mexico.\n\n&gt;Also, he never said banning Islam completely, he said banning Muslim entry, which is understandable considering how Europe, Africa, and the Middle East have gone haywire with Islamic radicalism and crime rates\n\nI don't think banning anyone from entering a country is understandable. Simply because a small minority of a religion are extremists does not mean everyone is. And how would he even implement that policy? Would he just ask every brown person at the border if they practice Islam?\n\n&gt;Actually, please go into that if you may\n\n[This](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/18-real-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women_us_55d356a8e4b07addcb442023) article directly references that quote so you may find it helpful. By the way, a person can say they aren't sexist but can still say sexist things. You do realize that?\n\n&gt;Capitalism gives everyone the chance if they work hard enough\n\nNot if they grow up in a poor background. How is someone growing up in low income housing, working a difficult minimum wage job supposed to compete? The world shouldn't be difficult for the less fortunate. There shouldn't be a less fortunate, the world can move past classes.\n\n&gt;The whole point of a capitalist free market is that it forces businesses to compete against each other\n\nThis is code for paying workers the least you can, selling products for as high as you can, getting rid of pollutants as cheaply as possible which destroys the environment tremendously, and profits going directly to those who did not labor to earn those profits. \n\nWe can move beyond capitalism. The profit incentive that causes starvation and low wages doesn't have to exist. Socialism is more than capable of ensuring no one starves in a world where there is enough food and shelter for everyone. I enjoy having complete worker autonomy and that is impossible under capitalism. You will always have a master under capitalism.\n\n","Ugh you are an insufferable fuck. Im definitely to the left but you are just so dense its ridiculous. I'll let someone more eloquent and less rude then myself to explain to you how stupid you sound.","But then is the violence even stopped? ","Violence is used to stop violence and for no other reason.

If you're bringing government into violence, call Socialism or Communism violent since most genocides have been under those forms of government","&gt;How the fuck is capitalism violent?\n\nCapitalism requires a state to enforce violent property laws in which the working class is exploited and doesn't receive the full fruits of their labor. Profits off of their labor, an extension of their self, are taken by capitalists who benefit and use those property laws to live off of other's labor.\n\n&gt;If you're bringing government into violence\n\nCapitalism and socialism are general economic ideas.\n\n&gt;call Socialism or Communism violent since most genocides have been under those forms of government\n\nCitation needed. The countries you're thinking of as socialist or communist are, I assume, the Soviet Union and China. They are considered state capitalist by many because the undemocratic states of those countries took over the means of production leaving the workers with no power over their work, the opposite of socialism which is capitalism. Socialism is worker control of the means of production. Communism is a form of socialism which is stateless, moneyless, classless, and propertyless. The countries were definitely not communist although a case could be made for them being socialist at times. Even if you consider those countries socialist (which they really weren't), the atrocities which happened in those countries were not caused by what economic system in place. They were caused by power hungry dictators like Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. The Soviet Union and China are, if anything, a sign that power cannot be monopolized by small groups of people like the wealthy under capitalism and the state under failed attempts at communism.

Half the front page posts on /r/the_donald aren't even about the campaign, it's just news articles about refugees in Europe and people bitching.  \n\nOne time, for funsies, I checked out some profiles posting on the_donald, and a lot of them also post on r/european, which is probably the most racist subreddit on this site.  They say nigger not like \"we're saying nigger lol\" and more like \"get these monkey ass niggers the fuck out of my country.\"  Also lots of good shit about wanting to kill Muslims, etc.  I don't understand their end game, anyways.  What do they want, a good ol' fashioned race war?\n\nAt least the internet presence of Trump supporters has become less about actual politics and more about participating in an echo chamber of racism.  Like, dudes, I don't want unchecked immigration like those dumbass Germans but Islam is not on my radar of importance for issues in U.S politics.  Shut the fuck up.\n\nThis post made me giggle, tho.","Hey man, not here to start an argument but as a poster and browser of r/european I can answer a few of those questions for you. Yes we do have some extreme racists on there and I don't blame you for being shocked about it. It's quite cancerous but I am a true believer in free speech and I allow anyone to express their opinions freely no matter what they are. The general purpose of the subreddit in my honest opinion is to post relatively unbiased and uncensored news regarding europe which would normally be taken down due to some progressive left censorship. As an aussie, I am still concerned with certain situations in europe as I still have some family living there. I hope I cleared just a few things up for you atleast, thanks mate.","As an actual European, let me tell you the posts on /r/european are mostly very biased.","Whatever you say, man.  Every time I walk into one of the comment sections there's always someone going on about how Arabs and Africans are racially inferior, did all the of the bad things in history, and have no right to be in Europe, and anyone who questions that ideology is denying history and science.  But if you want to use that place as a news source, more power to you I guess.","Reddit is generally a place of draconian rules that impede on free speech and extreme propaganda and censorship. I go there to vent and receive a metaphorical breath of fresh air. I know it may not be your cup of tea, but if you avoid the stupid comments which are quite prevalent throughout  (though which fucking subreddit doesn't have their fair share of retards?) It is a great place to gather and share information which would be otherwise censored on any other news website.

No racism there.\n\n/r/european is the subreddit known for \"the negros are inferior\" posts.\n\nThere's a lot of overlap between the two subs, but there's no overlap between religious intolerance and racism.","Hating Islam as a set of doctrines isn't xenophobic though. Hating muslims as a matter of principle because they're muslims is wrong but there are some fucked up doctrines in Islam.","&gt; I agree with you hating muslims as a matter of principle because they're muslims is wrong but there are some fucked up doctrines in Islam.\n\nI respectfully disagree. I see where you are getting at, \"Hate the ideology, not the follower\".\n\nBut to me, the followers keep the ideology alive. It's like saying \"Don't hate the nazi, hate hitler\". But Hitler's support is what made him Hitler. So I *do* hate Muslims solely because they're Muslims, they keep the Islamic doctrines alive. Remember, associating yourself with a religion is a **choice**. It's like **choosing** to be a white supremacist and then claiming \"Naziphobia!\", or \"Hate the game, not the player!\", when called out on your racism. Islamophobia is justified in my eyes because of this, it's inherently different from racism.\n\nNow before you call me out on anything, I just want to say that;\n\na) I know that some people don't choose their religion. Babies born in the Islamic state will most likely be converted to extremists because that's how they were raised, and due to a lack of education, they don't know any better. I don't hate those guys, I hate ones that live in a westernized modern city, but want to apply Sharia law to it. I hate the ones that escaped their hellhole, and now want to turn our society into their hellhole.\n\nb) I know that there are 'progressive' Muslims who don't strictly follow their religion. Those who condemn the Quran's intolerance, and those who even fight for womens' rights and LGBT rights. But these guys are hardly Muslims, they're Muslims by association. These guys are about as Muslim as Liberals born Christians are actual Christians, in other words, not at all.\n\nBut thanks for sharing, you bring up a good point, I just wanted a chance to refute.","That's not to say I am not against all muslims. I am. They believe in a set of doctrines which is at odds with modern western progressive society. Now obviously Maajid Nawaz isn't as high on the agenda as ISIS as to who I'm against and hate.

I don't like radical Islam either, and I don't want tons of Muslim immigrants in the U.S.  This is mostly Europe's problem right now, and it's not even close to a big issue in the U.S.  Blaming Muslims and Mexicans for America's laundry list of problems just shows the lack of education of Trump's supporters.\n\nIt's hilarious how not wanting Muslim hate to dominate the conversation automatically means I fucking love the religion.  Try again.","&gt;when they spew so much hate about Muslims\n\n\nYou do realize that the above statement in the context of your post is deriding Trump supporters for the act of spewing hate at Muslims. You are taking issue with the problem we (Trump supporters) have with Muslims and the derision we profess at them.\n\n\nSo, you're issue could be one of two potential scenarios;\n\n\n1) You take issue with anyone or any group that derides another weather legitimate or not. This means you just want everyone to be \"nice\" to each other.\n\n\n2) You take issue with the actual derision aimed at Muslims. This is indicative of an individual that supports or at least accepts the positions of Islam and it's Muslim followers. \n\n\nYet you then make the statement:\n\n&gt;I don't like radical Islam either\n\n\nThere is no such thing as \"radical Islam\". There is only Islam and its teachings and the adherents to its teaching.

You either misunderstand the meaning of xenophobia or are purposefully misconstruing the meaning to suit your contentions. The definition of Xenophobia is: *\"having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries.\"*\n\nI challenge you to find posts on r/The_Donald where supporters indicate hatred for *middle easterners*. You see, Islam and Muslims are not a race and do not come from one specific country. Trump supporters take issue with MUSLIMS and ISLAM which is NOT a race, but a RELIGION and as such no such xenophobia is being propagated. \n\n\n","I really enjoyed this comment because it's just interesting to see your mental gymnastics and how you people actually justify your warped view of reality.

My dad is retired and is quite handy with these moderately difficult upgrades.  There were a few of the houses that had very out-dated bathrooms and kitchens.  They saw roughly 1.3x returns by renovating them.  It's not a guaranteed return, but it can definitely add value under the right circumstances.","People will pay more just to not have to deal with bathroom or kitchen renovations.

It never made sense to me so logically. In essence, you have to remember that the removed kitchen is lost value so the replaced one needs to bring in way more than it is worth, hence the risk.. ","That depends, a lot. If you pay someone to do the work, there may be little or no ROI. But if you do the work yourself you can have a huge return. If you are doing cosmetic updates there is not much room for return, but if you currently have a dump (like our bathroom was) then there is lots of room.\n\nWe were quoted $42,000 to finish our bathroom, and I had already done all the subfloor and framing and the rough electrical and plumbing was done. I did almost all the rest myself, but paid a few grand for the tile guy's labor and 1400 or so more to the plumber, [edit: and spray foam insulation, and shower walls] and I'm sure many thousand on the tile, fixtures, etc. but still a small fraction of 42k. I'm still finishing up the trim, which takes me forever, but it's already a nicer bathroom than we've seen in million dollar condos around here.","It depends on if what you've got is total shit now.  If you are looking at 80's laminate wood cabinets and shitty color tone sinks, you will significantly raise your house value by renovating to something new and neutral.  If you already have something reasonably neutral, even if its a little old, you are better off keeping it.  Doing it yourself is a huge difference, too. If you are reasonably handy or have a friend who can help with stuff like simple plumbing you will save a TON which is cash back in your pocket.

In a hot or high priced market, buyers are not going to care about most of the renovation you do.  Chances are they will rip them all out for their own style or will just value any renovations at a minimum. In really low markets, it may also be hard to get back any costs. YMMV ","The ROI on renovations is frequently negative, but the same can't be said for routine maintenance and repairs.

It's not necessary to tell someone that their advice isn't useful solely because it doesn't pertain directly to you. \n\nI appreciate this advice because I find myself in similar situations where I put shit off around the house until last minute and, once under pressure to finish it, it gets half-assed because I'm rushing sometimes.\n\nKeeping this advice in the back of your head helps when you *really* don't feel like doing something, but remember that something could come up and having finished the job when you didn't feel like it, could have been substantially more advantageous  than putting it off until it *needed* to be done.\n\nBut you know, what the fuck do we know? Clearly some people don't need advice because they know everything already.... except the most important LPT, don't be an asshole just for the sake of being an asshole.

And [good falafel](http://bahnans.com/), of course (a must for any city). There's a great new [hipster-y/crunchy-granola bread bakery](http://www.birchtreebreadcompany.com/) too.

If the driver didn't see the kid, they weren't paying enough attention.","Have you ever been down the street where the kid was killed?  You can't go more than 10 mph down it, and that's fast.

Source: I drive a 16 thousand pound one.","An ambulance can stop on a dime if it's going slow enough.

If 10 mph is too fast to stop for the kid, it's too fast.\n\nGod forbid children are safe in the city without being leashed to their parents at all times. Children wander off sometimes.

What he is accused of smacks of corruption to me though maybe there is another, better, word to describe it.\n\nBut I want to call this part out from the article:\n\n&gt; The mayor insisted that as a union leader he was not one for hardball tactics, such as erecting inflatable rats outside nonunion construction sites. “That’s in the past,” he said. “It’s a business now. I don’t agree with those tactics.”\n\nWhy is that a \"hardball\" tactic from \"the past\"? That's protesting and activism is it not? It's actions that occur, at least, not behind closed doors with deals made unbeknownst to most union members so that should be a plus, no? Did the former Union leader forget where the roots of the Labor Movement drew its strength and influence? To me, it's far less \"hardball\" than calling up developers and threatening them but...perhaps I am in the minority on this one.\n\nAs a resident of Boston, this whole story is yet another thing to put on my list of reasons why I won't vote for Walsh in the next election. I truly hope Tito Jackson or Ayanna Pressley run next go-around because where there is smoke there is usually fire. And I find it to be a shame that the wiretaps from 2012 were not released either prior to or during the mayoral election.\n\nI understand why this kind of stuff takes time and at least we have that information now. Re-electing Walsh should be out of the question for voters but time will tell. People have this annoying habit where they forget shit like this.","I wish I had known Walsh would run for mayor so we could've saved the voicemails he'd leave us.\n\nHe was a bully and jackass.\n\nAlso fun little fact, \"Scabby\" the Rat that they haul around and inflate at protests is built at a non-union textile mill in the Midwest.","&gt; Also fun little fact, \"Scabby\" the Rat that they haul around and inflate at protests is built at a non-union textile mill in the Midwest.\n\nHa!","its not corruption when you live in an Oligarchy, this is business as usual.","Yeah, fair enough.","With you on Walsh. I can't get behind him the more I see of him.","yeah, I'm anti-union, stuff like this pretty much just fuels the fire.  Thanks Marty!  ","I am very much anti-union, and you are correct, it is easy. It is easy every time, because this happens...every time. I am for unions in theory, protecting workers benefits etc, but that is not how they are used. Unions are political tools that ear-mark state and federal money for their people, they bully everyone else because they have numbers.","&gt; they bully everyone else\n\nIt's true. When I was an SEIU member at Harvard, I personally beat up 2 anthropologists and 3 associate registrars until they accepted my grading curve policy. \n","Remember, dude, **every time**.","Seems like we both have a similar outlook on unions even if we came to different conclusions about them. I think it is better to have worker protection than to not have it. However, I think unions need to be drastically re-evaluated. When you can't tell where management ends and union begins - that's a problem. When unions decided to throw their support behind one of the two main political parties - that was a problem. Their real power and influence came from being outside of systems of power and threatening it rather than being co-opted by it. And when union presidents/leaders earn much more than the workers they represent, that is absolutely a problem but that's part of being co-opted by systems of power.\n\nAnd aside from police and maybe fire unions, I don't think there is that much bullying going on overall though I admit if it happens even once that's a bit of a problem as they come off not looking any better than the corporatist/capitalist agenda that they should be protesting against and I definitely don't think they have the numbers.","&gt;  And when union presidents/leaders earn much more than the workers they represent, that is absolutely a problem\n\nI'm not sure how this is a valid complaint. The unions are businesses. Their commodity is labor. Running a successful business requires competent leaders, which almost always means significantly higher pay.\n\nIn fact, most complaints against skilled labor unions (not necessarily from you, just in general) stem from failing to realize that they're just another market competitor looking to run a successful business.","&gt; The unions are businesses. \n\nThat's my complaint. They ought not behave like one. The struggle is against businesses and to become like them is where they begin to be co-opted and rendered ineffective, I believe.\n\n&gt; Running a successful business requires competent leaders, which almost always means significantly higher pay.\n\nSure for business but unions should be about solidarity and union presidents, in my opinion, ought to be paid the average of the salary of those they represent. Because in my experience, being in meetings and labor negotiations with union reps, they are all too willing and eager to agree with management **or** they just want to maintain the status quo. Never demanding more. Maintain the status quo and if something goes away, something must be put in it's place to *appear* to be going to bat for their membership but it's a farce. Usually what was taken away was much more meaningful to their workers than what was given. Their pockets are full, they are rubbing elbows with other people of power and I believe that many of them forgot where they came from. But that's just my lived experience so take that as you will. \n\nMaybe if Union presidents or leaders weren't earning big bucks, they'd be less likely to bend over and grab their ankles or agree to increasingly shittier deals on behalf of the workers they represent in the name of \"keeping good relations\" with management or systems of power. They'd be more cognizant of the struggle of the working class.\n\n&gt; In fact, most complaints against skilled labor unions (not necessarily from you, just in general) stem from failing to realize that they're just another market competitor looking to run a successful business.\n\nYeah, fair enough. I think where we disagree is that while I agree they operate *like* a business, that's exactly where I think they begin to lose their way.\n\n","&gt; That's my complaint. They ought not behave like one. The struggle is against businesses and to become like them is where they begin to be co-opted and rendered ineffective, I believe.\n\nThey've *always* been businesses. They faltered when their leadership stopped understanding this and started protecting inefficiency. That's when they got their bad reps and started losing jobs in the 70s and 80s. Strong arm tactics and inefficient workers is why they've lost so much marketshare.\n\nIn the last decade or two, unions leaders have started to realize the only way to be successful is to get back to running successful businesses. The only way they're going to hang on to market share is to provide a product (labor) deserving of its higher price. This works particularly well for skilled trades, as they can provide a higher quality of training, with a known standard, than their non-union counterparts.\n\n&gt;Sure for business but unions should be about solidarity and union presidents, in my opinion, ought to be paid the average of the salary of those they represent. Because in my experience, being in meetings and labor negotiations with union reps, they are all too willing and eager to agree with management. Their pockets are full, they are rubbing elbows with other people of power and I believe that many of them forgot where they came from. But that's just my lived experience so take that as you will.\n\nPaid the average salary? So you want leadership getting paid less than half of the people they're representing? That's how you get terribly unskilled leaders protecting terribly unskilled laborers and losing jobs to non-union labor.\n\n&gt;Maybe if Union presidents or leaders weren't earning big bucks, they'd be less likely to bend over and grab their ankles or agree to increasingly shittier deals on behalf of the workers they represent in the name of \"keeping good relations\" with management or systems of power. They'd be more cognizant of the struggle of the working class.\n\nBut they're not grabbing their ankles for shittier and shittier deals. It's actually keeping people employed, still with significantly better deals than their non-union counterparts.\n\nThe alternative is simply putting union laborers out of work, as demonstrated by the failures of the UAW.\n\n&gt;Yeah, fair enough. I think where we disagree is that while I agree they operate like a business, that's exactly where I think they begin to lose their way.\n\nIt's really when they stopped operating like businesses that they lost their way. The UAW is the best example of a union refusing to accept its role as a business and make smart business moves to protect its marketshare. They've put countless members out of work due to the \"old school\" approach you're advocating, rather than embracing a similar approach to many building trades that have realized the only way labor stays employed is when contractors are making money.\n\nIn the short term, sure you can fight to protect the lazy incompetent few and it keeps them employed. In the long term, keeping those few employed puts a far greater number of productive people out of work.","&gt; They faltered when their leadership stopped understanding this and started protecting inefficiency. That's when they got their bad reps and started losing jobs in the 70s and 80s. Strong arm tactics and inefficient workers is why they've lost so much marketshare.\n\nGlobalization is what played a large factor in the decline of labor unions, I would argue. Though to back up for a second, where I am coming from is someone who worked for a little while in the public sector in a heavily union work environment. Just to provide some more context here.\n\n&gt; Paid the average salary? So you want leadership getting paid less than half of the people they're representing? That's how you get terribly unskilled leaders protecting terribly unskilled laborers and losing jobs to non-union labor.\n\nI think it's worth trying out because unions, to me, shouldn't be so damn hierarchical. Instead, the attitude should be a \"first among equals\" mentality or something close to it.\n\n&gt; But they're not grabbing their ankles for shittier and shittier deals. It's actually keeping people employed, still with significantly better deals than their non-union counterparts.\n\nOh, no. That's not what I have seen in the slightest but if you have then I won't begrudge you your experience.\n\n&gt; The alternative is simply putting union laborers out of work, as demonstrated by the failures of the UAW.\n\nWhat failed them was globalization and trying to be too accommodating to capitalism. UAW was not radical enough.\n\nI do think you are minimizing the role that globalization and corporatism has had on labor unions in particular within the private sector.\n\nWithin the public sector is where most of my work experience comes with labor unions and union reps and \"protecting marketshare\" is not the aim there at all. It's about feeling important and powerful all while doing little to nothing for their union membership.\n\n","Let me start off by saying public sector unions are an entirely different animal, and shouldn't be conflated with skilled trade unions or unskilled trade unions (note: most T employees fall under skilled trades, despite operating in the public sector). I've kept to discussing skilled labor unions, as they're the only ones actually capable of providing value commensurate with their price. Public sector unions don't really have competition or marketshare to be protected, lost, or gained in the way skilled labor unions do. Unskilled labor unions (UFCW, much of SEIU, etc.) have plenty of competition and marketshare up for grabs, but little value to add unless they have a monopolistic hold on the labor supply.\n\nGlobalization hurt certain types of manufacturing in the US, yes, but it played a very small role in the UAW's failures. The UAW continually supported inefficient labor and the poor quality that comes with it. Americans cars earned a bad reputation for quality because the UAW refused to budge on those issues, and refused to realize they were partners in success with the Big Three. What's happened in the last 30 years is more an more foreign automakers have actually moved production to the US, but avoided the UAW like the plague that it is. The UAW's bullheadedness is almost entirely why they've permanently lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, and why those jobs are being replaced with more talented non-union laborers.\n\nThe contrast here is skilled trade unions like the building trades. In Boston, at the least, many of them have realized their predicament and made efforts to change so they can still make a value proposition that includes higher wages for their members. This is the only way they're going to have sustained success. Labor leaders flirting with the line between corruption and representation are temporary fixes, if they're fixes at all. If unions are hard to work with, and provide no value over non-union labor, companies that are free to choose their labor suppliers will choose non-union labor whenever they can.\n\nThis is why the UAW has failed to protect jobs. Doubling down and being harder to work with for lower quality work isn't a successful business model for unions providing labor any more than it is for OEMs providing electronics, brake pads, tires, etc.\n\n&gt;I think it's worth trying out because unions, to me, shouldn't be so damn hierarchical. Instead, the attitude should be a \"first among equals\" mentality or something close to it.\n\nGoing back to this, no successful business is run this way for very long. It's a fine mentality for startups with 10 members having different but equal inputs to the success of the business, but it doesn't work beyond that stage. Competent leadership has a price, and it's a hell of a lot more valuable than the average salary of a single employee.","Same. The days when the USA was prosperous enough to afford to have unions get away with robbing the public blind are over. ","The US is wealthier now than it has ever been.","hahahaha go fuck yourself.\n\nhttps://oregoneconomicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/us_debtgdp_ratio.jpg\n\nMaybe in absolute, current dollars the economy is the largest it has ever been, in terms of financial health, the United States is in a poor position.","Thanks for the thoughtful &amp; constructive continuation of the dialogue.","One-term Walsh strikes again. ","Good","&gt; At issue in the investigation is whether labor officials threatened developers and business people who hired nonunion workers on their projects\n\nHow glorious would it be if Walsh gets to live in a cage for a few years for this corruption? All started from some mouth breathing union tradesmen went and destroyed TV production crew's private property. \n\nEdit: looks like there are 2 different investigations: AvalonBay - feds tapped his phone lines-  and the TV show. How exciting! ","How is he not in jail for this?","Good ole one-term Mahty back at it!","I don't like Walsh at all but this is something I don't mind by him. Developers are ruining this city, they had better treat the workers right while they do it.","&gt; Developers are ruining this city\n\nGo on?","&gt;Developers are ruining this city\n\nBuilding all that housing to address the lack-thereof while pumping in hundreds of thousands, if no millions into the city's coffers via fees?\n\nHave anything at all to back it up?","&gt; Developers are ruining this city\n\nDefine ruining. You mean adding housing? ","Housing that will never be affordable to the actual local residents or low income people of Boston, only attracts that modern Yuppie crowd. So that is why developers are destroying the city. They are gentrifying the city by jacking up the market price for rent to unaffordable minimums and highs and kicking out the culture that makes Boston a city...Chinatown, Dorchester etc are all losing their ethnic cultures day by day. Adding housing doesn't always just help.","&gt;Housing that will never be affordable to the actual local residents or low income people of Boston, only attracts that modern Yuppie crowd.\n\nNo, the economy of Metro Boston that's in a historic boom is drawing the Yuppies with high paying jobs. You don't move somewhere because they have cool apartments, you move somewhere there's a job.\n\n&gt;They are gentrifying the city by jacking up the market price for rent to unaffordable minimums and highs and kicking out the culture that makes Boston a city..\n\n90% of the development right now is reclaiming light industrial wastelands.\n\nThe Seaport used to be a sea of parking lots, and now there's milions of square feet of mixed used Development.\n\nCharlestown had a defunct Navy Yard and now has half million dollar condos.\n\nEast Boston had burned down piers and condemned warehouses and now has a booming apartment market.\n\nMost of the development isn't displacing housing, it's adding new housing that never exists.\n\nOnly thing being displaced are the rats.\n","Show me where these high paying jobs are. How much do you make on salary? Who cares if a small percentage of people can afford these apartments, we need to care about the people across the board, low income people also make up a city. They are the ones that make up these amazing mom and pops restaurants, small shops, work at the stores that these Yuppies shop at, do the dirty jobs that none of these yuppies will do (trash workers, mechanics, etc) They need a place to live as well, and if the rent is too high, well all we will have is Hip Yuppies with in my opinion little to no soul, and they add very little to society, just buying expensive clothes, expensive cars, living in expensive skyrisers, like that doesn't help general people like I.    \n    \nCool, you forget to mention some of those developers are also building up in Chinatown, Columbia Point Dorchester, Egleston Square, Jamaica Plain. The Asians, Blacks and Spanish people are all being slowly pushed out. Chinatown alone has lost restaurants that have been there for 20+ years this past year because of the development that is happening. So while it may be helping other places that other wise looked like crap, it also is gentrifying and hurting other places. I'd like to see that 90% stat because millennium tower, ink block, the new tower being built in south bay plaza in Dorchester, these places are being built in areas that aren't wastelands and are now going to raise up the market price for that area which in turn gentrifies it since the POC and minorities are simply unable to afford it.","&gt;Show me where these high paying jobs are. \n\nSeaport, Kendall, Somerville, etc.\n\nDo you think BioTech, Pharmacy, Finance, and Computer Science are low paying jobs?\n\nWhere do you *think* these people are coming from? They wouldn't be building these apartments if people couldn't afford them.\n\n&gt;we need to care about the people across the board, low income people also make up a city. They are the ones that make up these amazing mom and pops restaurants, small shops etc. They need a place to live as well, and if the rent is too high, well all we will have is Hip Yuppies with in my opinion little to no soul.\n\nNobody is saying people don't care about low income people, but it what world do you live in that a low income person is going to be able to live in a brand new 40 story condo with skyline views?\n\n&gt;Cool, you forget to mention some of those developers are also building up in Chinatown, Columbia Point Dorchester, Egleston Square, Jamaica Plain.\n\nNobody is tearing down houses in Jamaica Plain to build apartment buildings.\n\nThe corridor down Washington Street in JP being developed is replacing parking lots and warehouses and other light manufacturing.\n\n&gt;I'd like to see that 90% stat because millennium tower,  ink block\n\nWhat was the Millennium Tower before hand, do you even remember? It wasn't apartments, and it wasn't too long ago that it was considered the Combat Zone, so I don't know why you're making it sound like families were kicked out to the streets to build an Ivory Tower for rich people.\n\nThe entire Metro area is going through a giant market correction like every other big city does.\n\nThe more you push back on developers building new housing stock, the more those people coming to work in these new jobs are going to have to rent somewhere else, so the better chance that landlord is gonna jack the rent because he knows there's ten people looking at that apartment.\n\nSupply and Demand dude, it's not hard.\n\nYou want cheaper housing and rent? Build a shitload of it.\n\n","Just go to some of the neighborhood community centers in Chinatown, Dorchester, Mattapan and ask them how rent has gone up too much in the past few years, how they are not able to afford the apartments they used to be able to afford. The towers are nice and all but they also affect the smaller housing around them. So while they may have cleaned up a plot of land that was nothing, it ends up fucking over every other apartment there by jackingup the market rate. Boston Housing Authority used to do a good job of having free/subsidized housing in housing that has expensive apartments but sets aside some for the low income people. But you see lately these new buildings, only like 10 or so apartments out of like 200 will be set aside for these people. I don't know man, I used to make 100k via a comp sci job and I still wouldn't want to pay 2k+ for a high riser studio apartment and feed the rich fuckers. I'd rather live in an old apartment owned by some person that has been in that neighborhoods for decades and support the local people. The city needs to just make sure these developers are setting aside like 30% of the apartments for low income or more it is necessary, we all need to do our part in helping bring up others in the community. There is just too many homeless and low income for me to care if there isn't enough housing for rich yuppies. ","&gt;Just go to some of the neighborhood community centers in Chinatown, Dorchester, Mattapan and ask them how rent has gone up too much in the past few years, how they are not able to afford the apartments they used to be able to afford. \n\nChinatown is sandwiched by the Theater District and Financial District. It's literally one stop away from Downtown Crossing. In what world would it be cheap to live there?\n\nThat being said they do a great job of keeping the identity, but come on dude. That's like bitching some spot on Park Avenue is expensive. You're in Manhattan, of course it is.\n\nDorchester is seeing raising rents along the Red Line, well, because it's along the Red Line. That's supply and demand dude, what's your solution?\n\n&gt;The towers are nice and all but they also affect the smaller housing around them.\n\nThe locals and landlords are the ones raising the rents on the existing housing stock, get mad at them for pushing out their own neighbors.\n\nAnd what's your honest argument against that?\n\n\"No we want to keep that old manufacturing warehouse with the environmental problems just the way it is so that our rent stays cheap?\"\n\n&gt;The city needs to just make sure these developers are setting aside like 30% of the apartments for low income or more it is necessary, we all need to do our part in helping bring up others in the community.\n\nNo.\n\nThe larger portion of the building you take and put into the hands of the government agencies, the more rent that the developer has to charge on the others that are actually on the open market.\n\nThe only way. The absolute *only* way that this works is building more housing stock. Yes, rents will rise, but that happens. You'll have to live a little farther from the city to afford it.\n\nKeep in mind the only reason most were able to afford it to begin with was because \"white people\" left in the 1970s for the suburbs when the schools went to hell.\n\nWell now there's a generation of white people who are putting off having kids so they don't care about the schools, they care about not sitting in traffic going to/from work. They care about living close to downtown so they can walk to work and have bars and restaurants closebye.\n\nNeighborhoods have *always* always been organic and evolving. I don't know why now it's this things where they have to be stuck however they are now forever.\n\nMattapan used to be Jewish, the North End used to be called the \"Black Sea\" full of sailors and degenerates. Part of Beacon Hill used to be black. Eastie used to be Irish. It's all different now. It'll all be different in twenty years.\n\n","I love how you mention white people are the ones moving into downtown, which clearly shows these other colors clearly can't afford these areas. This clearly shows there is income inequality between races. I'm sorry I am a man of color, so I live in this world of problems a colored person has to face, so you'll never understand life from my eyes or the struggle my people face.","&gt; I love how you mention white people are the ones moving into downtown, which clearly shows these other colors clearly can't afford these areas. \n\nI also mentioned why these areas are desirable. Chinatown is prime real estate. So is East Boston.\\\n\n&gt; This clearly shows there is income inequality between races.\n\nOh dear.\n\nYes, there's also not a perfect distribution across all industries.\n\nAsians and Indians are a smaller minority than African Americans *and* may have a language barrier, yet there's definitely an income inequality there because they probably make *more* than white people.\n\n&gt; I'm sorry I am a man of color, so I live in this world of problems a colored person has to face, so you'll never understand life from my eyes or the struggle my people face.\n\nAnd so what are you proposing?\n\nStop economic growth?\n\nStop adding jobs?\n\nOr it's only okay if white people only displace white people?\n\nAnd only colored people can struggle?\n\nI went to college with some of \"your people\" who's parents were doctors and had everything handed to them.\n\nI went to funerals with some of \"my people\" who grew up poor and found their way into drugs.\n\nI used \"white people\" in quotes because it's colloquially known as \"The Great White Flight\" when they left, which is what created the opportunity for affordable housing for many minorities in pockets of downtown to begin with.\n\nSo, you know, markets are cyclical. The market went down and created an opportunity, and now it's rebounded and I'm sorry you're at the age where you can't benefit from it like the previous generation did, but it is what it is.\n\nIt's like complaining the Celtics are doing better because now tickets are expensive.\n\nIt's economics dude.\n","T-minus one hour until comments about Walsh's corruption and ineptitude begin.\n\nT-minus one hour and one day until the same commenters flip back to shitting all over the Globe.","Aside from all of the \"T-minus\" stuff you're posting, how do you feel about this?

I don't think that suggests that I'm a serial poster along a particular line.\n\n&gt; This is the first of many things he's either said or done that have been questionable.\n\nI don't accept that premise. My impression has been that Mayor Walsh has been choosing his positions on issues based on what's most likely to get him reelected. And when public sentiment on an issue has changed during his tenure, so too has his position (see: Olympics). To that end, I think this is absolutely not the first time in which something he's said or done has been questionable, but then, I don't agree with him on many things, so it's only natural for me to say that.\n\nFor the record, I didn't vote for Walsh in the primary (Consalvo), and I didn't vote for him in the general, so I'm not predisposed to support him anyway.\n\nAll that said, my comment was more a defense of the Globe than anything else. My expectation was that people would come in here and use this article as evidence of misconduct or questionable behavior by the mayor. And then only 24 hours later, return to shitting all over the newspaper that brought said evidence to light. It was an observation of the irony of throwing stones at the major press in the city within a day of using their work to throw stones at something else.","&gt; And when public sentiment on an issue has changed during his tenure, so too has his position (see: Olympics).\n\nYou mean the 15 minute warning press conference he hastily put together when Baker was giving his presser at the top of the hour after Baker made the decision he was taking the olympics away from Walsh?\n\n&gt; And then only 24 hours later, return to shitting all over the newspaper that brought said evidence to light. \n\nI think /r/boston is very favorable of the real journalists on the Globe.

Every EA, ubisoft and square enix game this year uses denuvo and all future releases from them will as well. Unfortunately DRM seems to be winning at the moment.","&gt;Unfortunately *for pirates*\n\nFtfy. \n\nAlso, I'm curious, does the Denuvo DRM affect the consumer very much?

","Piracy is an arm's race. Developers tend to not think about things in terms of getting cracked or not but rather, how long it takes until a crack. Anything can be pirated but how long it should take is what matters in determining whether buying protection adds value.","Look at the date on the article. Do you see them available now?

I followed his \"hack\" a while back where you were able to create your own \"twitter app\" and that released another set of fresh tokens. You faked an app and it rode on the back of Falcon Pro, totally skirting Twitter's asinine limitation.\n\nSure he works at Twitter now, but after that stunt, I'd say he has nothing to do with this. There is no conspiracy, it's just Twitter being mad about 3rd party apps (i.e. they want you to bask in their ads on the official platform).","Plenty of other apps have it (Fenix included). Don't gotta work at Twitter for that.","Which was an incredible opportunity for him. He was on it all by himself, and now he's working in the US and his position at the Twitter HQ jumpstarted his career. He's meeting a lot of interesting people and can look at a bright future in the dev field. He's a nice guy and FP3 still kicks ass overall.","How does that work? ","I'm only speculating that he's actually doing it but it would work by having multiple apps listed on the Twitter developer site, where each app is given 100,000 user tokens. He then just codes it into his app that once one limit is reached it just switches to the next token.","If that kind of thing is allowed by twitter, why impose these restrictions in the first place?? ","It's not allowed.","I don't think it's allowed, but the developer probably gets away with it because he currently works for Twitter *and* also hasn't really done anything with the app aside from bug fixes in a long time.","That's against Twitter's policy. Your app will be blocked if you do stuff like that. You need to have actual separate apps to get around the token limit.","\"Fenix 2!!!\"","I am sure development will slow, and eventually stop.

It's either 100,000 tokens or 2x the active tokens if your app was around before the api change. \n\nSince Tweetbot is pretty much the only game in town on iOS I'm assuming they have a huge (but still finite) amount of tokens. ","Ohhh, i thought they circumvented the limit by just making a new app, thanks.","I think this also works. I remember one of the Klinker brothers mentioning it as a reason for why they released a new Talon version for 5.x only.

Much, much, much harder to program and maintain.\n2. Can break at any time if Twitter changes their markup structure, metadata, or internal API structure or format.\n3. Slightly higher CPU usage and network load.\n4. Using the internal Twitter JavaScript API will result in relatively high memory usage (&gt;100 times more) compared to using their public external API. This is because you will essentially need to load Twitter.com with a real browser (e.g. embed Chromium) and programmatically interface with the browser. This is extremely memory heavy.\n5. If Twitter really hates you, they can easily break your product right after every update by doing intentional changes that result in the consequences of drawback \\#3. This is very unlikely to happen as it requires a lot of effort from Twitter to constantly restructure their internal APIs.\n\nAll of this has got me thinking: I should make a framework for this and make it compatible with the public external Twitter API. Clearly there is a need for this, and developers would probably pay a flat $200/mo fee for such a product if I maintained it with updates for when Twitter breaks things.","Or just make an app called Phoenix 2 with a new API key.

It's one thing to have critical mass, but with superior enough competition you can still lose that critical mass eventually and when you do there's no recovery from that. Ask Myspace, or Digg or Altavista. There's no such thing as too big to fail on the Internet. Twitter is failing to compete because they're treating their users and developers like second class citizens, it's going to catch up to them sooner or later.","The company is already falling apart. In a desperation move, they hired back the founder. Many of their best engineers have jumped ship, along with [half their execs](http://www.wired.com/2016/01/twitters-leaders-leaving/). They'll survive for a long time because of the popularity they gained, but they will eventually become the husk that companies like Yahoo have become. The fact that Dorsey has not removed this insane API user limit makes it clear they have no intentions to do what's right for the user and platform developers, which will kill them in the long run.","The Twitter stockholders demand it to have much faster growing userbase. I'm not an expert, but to me Twitter is already almost everywhere, how much more popular can you get? There is always a limit to how many users you can obtain, maybe their expectations are too high? ","Well Twitter has around 300 million users, while Facebook has 1.2 billion and YouTube has around the same. So there's definitely room for growth. The problem is Twitter is still quite a hard product for users to grasp, especially if your friends aren't active on it. ","This right here I'll never use Twitter because none of my friends use it. Why use Twitter when face book does everything twitter does plus more. Also who the fuck wants to deal with a character limit. No bueno. ","I couldn't care less if my friends are on it or not. I use it purely for news. No better way to see breaking news when you follow the right people in your field of interest. \n\nThis is something that Twitter needs to push further. ","That's actually a really good point, I get most of my news via reddit but I never considered using Twitter as a way to get the news as it unfolds. ","The problem with using Reddit for news is you can miss the news if you don't go to your subreddit or it doesn't hit the front page. With Twitter you just start off where you last left off (obviously only possible if you follow a reasonable number of people. I have 250ish and it's fine)\n\nThen it's down to you. Just follow the right websites, journalists and reporters (turn off their retweets) and you've got a fine and manageable stream. ","Huh you see the most annoying thing to me was the retweets I didn't know you could turn them off I might have to give it a second go. ","Yep. It's the first thing I do when I click to follow someone","Agreed completely. I use Twitter for one thing: chess news. Most of the top players, clubs, and organizers have active accounts, and there simply isn't a better way to see what's going on in the chess world than following the right folks on Twitter.","Care to share some of your favorite sources? ","I'm an Apple, soccer, Tottenham Hotspur and cricket fan (on Twitter) so the people I follow probably aren't going to be much use to this sub. \n\nGeneral tech wise: Joannastern, Panzer, benedictevans, charlesarthur\n\nEven those might be a bit more skewed towards Apple. I don't really have anyone from the Android scene, besides MKBHD. Anyone recommend one?","news and customer service. I'm sure it works just as well with facebook, but if I have a (possibly negative) inquiry and post it to twitter, I'll get a *lot* better results that if I'd just sent it through the contact me email page. ","Agreed. When Google Reader was killed, I used feedly for awhile. Now, I've replaced RSS with Twitter by following the websites I read.","As a man interested in tech, security, and exploit news, this.","At first I thought this, but then I realized all I wanted was a stripped down version of Facebook. I don't want the ads, the clickbait, the absurd levels of data mining, the asshole CEO, the endless shitposting from all of the \"friends\" you met once or knew years ago but don't want to offend by unfriending, the crippling battery drain from the phone app, etc. Twitter's not perfect on these points, but it's a hell of a lot better.\n\nI was forced to make an account for my freshman writing seminar (no joke - I wrote an essay about Charlie Sheen) and I've really liked it ever since. It's particularly excellent for organizing, and for following news and reactions. I really noticed this for the first time after the Boston bombings; I was able to get live information far before any news outlets and even other online news sources, which was important, especially since I go to school about 20 minutes from the bombing site and 10-15 minutes from where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was cornered in that boat. I think the character limit actually makes it even better suited to this purpose; messages get out quickly, and they're always short and to the point. No fluff, just information.\n\nAnother plus is that it really isn't a time suck. It's easy to set up notifications for the people and organizations you care about, so there's hardly any need to open the app. The character limit is great here too; the you can read the whole message from the notification shade rather than seeing an ellipsis and having to continue reading in the app. I'd guess that about 80% of my interactions with Twitter happen in my notification shade. I only open Twitter these days when I'm looking for tweets on a specific trend or event, like a soccer match or a presidential primary.\n\nFinally, the fact that few of my friends use it is actually appealing to me. Back when I had a Facebook account, the amount that people knew about my life was a bit creepy honestly. I would go out to eat with friends, for example, and would have text messages asking how it was before I had even left. Even more common was trying to tell a friend story about something cool I had done recently, only for them to tell me that they had already seen the pictures on Facebook and knew all about it. I seldom posted either, which made this all the more annoying; all it takes is one friend to post a picture of their food or something and either link me or tag me and boom, everyone else knows where I am and what I'm doing. Something like that has never happened on Twitter since I got my account, which has been really nice.\n\nTL;DR Twitter is less popular and doesn't have as many features, but that's actually a good thing.\n\nSome edits for clarity.","I actually think Twitter is a horrible medium for friend communication.      Posts go by far to fast to ever see anything from \"friends\"... it's different than a Facebook wall.  Where it *does* excel is acting as a real-life notification system... Follow local news, sports teams you care about, your local transit authority, breaking world news... pretty much anything/anyone where it would be handy/interesting to know what they are doing *right now* but it wouldn't matter if you missed something more than a half-hour old.\n\nI look at it more than any other social media but I don't ever actually communicate with friends through it.","Twitter is also great for occasional chatting with content creators - musicians, webcomic artists, game developers. Typically not the \"big ones\" because they're usually too busy to go on social media themselves, but for the smaller guys it's a great way to personally interact with your fans. \n\nOr a terrible way if you're a critic of anything, just ask TotalBiscuit.","That's not entirely true. Yes, Facebook can do  a lot that Twitter does, but Twitter is  a lot more streamlined. \n\nTwitter also has a slight learning curve so the user base isn't as horrible as Facebook. ","I'm not a heavy Twitter user personally but what I like about is that my friends aren't on it. I follow people that I think are interesting, news outlets, stuff related to my hobbies. \n\nExample. I'm a big Star Wars fan and software developer. I follow Star Wars news sources, people in the star wars community like costuming groups, podcasters, etc. I follow developers who work in the areas i'm interested in or do work in. I'm also a big fan of comedy so I follow several stand-up.\n\nTwitter, for me, is much more stuff I'm personally interested in and topical. I don't tweet much, but when I do tweet. It tends to be relevant to those interests. I'm not posting my daily schedule or what I ate for lunch. ","&gt;Well Twitter has around 300 million users, while Facebook has 1.2 billion and YouTube has around the same. So there's definitely room for growth. \n\nThat assumes that there are 900 million non-twitterers who would *want to* sign up for twitter. \n\nMost of the people I know in real life have no interest in twitter (either for tweeting or following).","That's the dilemma Twitter faces, either it makes the product more appealing or stays on this course of stagnation. ","The trouble is \"more appealing\" to a wider subset of the population means removing the things which make it different from Facebook in the first place. This alienates current users and no one will switch from Facebook to Twitter just because twitter became more like Facebook.","Right, but I don't think removing the character limit or changing the way people add/reply to each other is necessarily moving towards Facebook, it is just making the features of its product more user friendly to people that've never tweeted before. ","It also defeats the purpose of Twitter. If I had to scroll through 1000 word posts and stuff like that, I'd leave Twitter. I use it for news and updates, not stories.","I don't think they need to pull people away from Facebook. I would guess that most people who use Twitter ALSO use Facebook. So the problem is just making it more appealing to a wider demographic. ","I can't imagine what Twitter could do to make themselves appealing to me.","Pretty much this. I used to use Twitter, but eventually I realized that I was wasting my life trying to keep up with it and gave up on it. I just don't have enough time in the day to follow it, let alone contribute. ","I feel like Facebook has a more family friendly website compared to a Twitter. I don't really see families tweeting each other to stay in touch. ","That's the money people for ya. They are slaves to infinite expansion. I believe that when there are companies investing millions in super niche apps that there is gonna be a bubble bursting. \n\nSo many apps/sites that everyone knows started from dorm rooms with little money or investment. If they did it then, they think this can happen again if enough money is thrown at the devs. \n\nI believe that the only money that gets transferred between these huge sites and apps are money from big companies buying ads to investor's pockets. Only a few categories (mainly games) get money from actual users. \n\nThe users are the ones who carry money from ad people to investors so it's no wonder they demand impossibly high membership numbers. ","&gt;I'm not an expert, but to me Twitter is already almost everywhere,  \n\nAustrian here. Twitter is what? I visit it sometimes because most international companies use it(server up/down info for games), but I have not met a single person in Austria that uses Twitter. I myself only have an account because it's the fastest way to get screenshots of my ps4.  \nIn the German speaking sphere it barely exists, the tech afficionados use it, but it's nowhere near the size of Facebook here, and newsstatins only started using hashtags once Facebook made them a thing.  \nThey just never captured the market here, so I suppose there is room for growth still.   \nBut personally I wonder why it is still around. I definitely like it more than Facebook because it's simplistic, but I also get why everyone uses Facebook primarily, as it's simply a social tool and great for events and reaching people without having their phone number.","Twitter is the social media equivalent of text messaging.","I've always explained it as \"The worlds biggest IRC server.\" Once you understand it as a massive chat room (complete with # channels!), it makes a lot more sense.","It's the same for Ireland and the UK. Almost every TV show lists a hashtag at the beginning, and radio shows always want you to tweet them, but nobody in the real world uses it. People that work in media love it and they all follow and tweet at other journalists/presenters/companies but they're living in a bubble. They work hard to funnel all their fan interaction through their Twitter accounts and as a result, they end up thinking that people actually use the platform normally. For joe public, Twitter is a good avenue for when you really want to contact a specific media personality. Other than that, it's just the place you go to complain to tech companies about your devices not working properly.","The APi limit exists solely to fuck over 3rd party devs. Why? Because they want to retain control over how you use their platform. 3rd party devs can filter out ads, or rearrange your feed as they see fit, and ignore the retarded \"trending\" shit that's full of sponsored BS (seriosuly, does anyone but Buzzfeed actually look at 'trending' on Twitter, or is that just me?), all contrary to how twitter think you should use the service.\n\nThey allow third party apps though because it allows them to steal good ideas, the API limit is only there to prevent 3rd party apps that are popular to actually become a major player. Once they hit their (stupidly low) limit, they can't viably grow any more, and they remain a niche product. Twitter can then look at the app and steal any good ideas it might have.\n\nWhy does Twitter do that? Because the very nature of the medium prevents it from growing. As someone else said: twitter is already everywhere, it cannot grow its user base any more, except by heavily going for new foreign market, but those have dried up too: sure, they can chase some African and Asian countries, but the ROI to conquer those markets will be low.\n\nSo, how else increase revenue? Milk your users more. Except: twitter is so stupidly simple (from the simple types of messages you can send/recieves -tweet,retweet,reply, DM- to the messages limit of 140 characters to the simple follow/unfollow system), there simply isn't a whole lot more Twitter can actually *do* to milk its users for data. It's not Facebook, where you have pictures, pages, groups, messenger, profile pages, etcetcetc... It's just... twitter: if they start adding features, 99% of its users won't ever use them, because they have Facebook for those features.\n\nSo all twitter can do is prolong its slow death by clinging to the control they have over the apps in the most shitty way possible.\n\nPersonally though, I do actually like twitter in one way: it's *perfect* for customer service. I hate having to call, and contacting CS via email is usually painfully slow. Over twitter, somehow companies feel the pressure to answer you quickly.","Twitter is so searchable or discoverable and very public so CS pounces on complaints.  That is also what makes Twitter great for breaking news.  Setting up complex searches works great.  ","As a Hail Mary, at least Jack seems like he has more imagination than your various C-types. Seems. We'll see.","When he was brought back on he said that one of their goals was to be more friendly to third party developers. \n\nI'm not sure what or when. ","I get the sentiment and as a Fenix user I am annoyed by this, but third party apps don't help twitter. Fenix doesn't serve twitter's ads to me. I, and my app, are using twitters servers and resources and not doing anything that let's them make money to offset the cost. Third party apps are basically ad blockers at this point, I can't think of any that serve ads, it's a miracle twitter doesn't just shut them down all together.","Yes, it's like expecting the Spotify API to work with free account. You can't ensure they show your ads in third party apps. \n\nTo make it work Twitter has to find another way than ads to make money. For now it's just not possible economically to let third party apps run unlimited.\n\nThey could make the API access paying to compensate. They'd get a share of the app sells. ","Meh that's not a good excuse. Easy way to \"ensure\" they are showing your ads is by putting ads it in the api - if they don't show ads for an oauth user then limit their userbase.","This is Twitter, though. Facebook is awful yet still has a massive userbase. I doubt the entire public are going to leave Twitter any time soon.","You can have a billion users and still be falling apart because you can't make enough money out of them","It isn't about leaving, it is about failing to grow.

Only a *massive* controversy (or its closure) would get the masses away from Twitter.","This is dumb. There are so many teens on facebook. Twitter may be more popular than  fb in the US but not in the rest of the world.","facebook has successfully gained traction in large parts of the developing world, these gains are huge. In the U.S. their growth among teens is much lower than their growth among every other age group. Nobody is saying a company with 1.6B users is going to fail tomorrow, nor is anyone saying no teens are on FB. The point is their growth is slowing, and the 13-17 market is where they are going to get their new users from to sustain growth.\n\nhttp://radar.oreilly.com/2008/12/facebook-growth-regions-and-ge.html","&gt; Know who isn't on fb? Teens\n\n&gt; nor is anyone saying no teens are on FB.\n\nAnyway your source is 8 years old. [Entrepreneur recently released a study that shows 71% of teens are on Facebook](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246777)","I doubt it. Twitter is making pretty heavy losses, it needs to prioritise sellings ads to survive, not allowing lots of ad-free third-party twitter clients.","Twitter ad ROI is very low compared to FB or other ad networks. It's not usually worth spending money with them. I think that's their biggest problem.","They're actively doing things like this, is the sad thing. They shut down the TweetDeck app on Windows. They have an *incredibly* restrictive API- third party apps don't have access to group chats, or polls.\n\nAnd, from what I've heard, their official app is full of ads now, so I assume they are trying to push people to it in the long run anyway.","Twitter, like Facebook, has filled my news feeds with so many ads. I'm so done with both but unfortunately people still use both and some apps or websites still require you to sign on using the account","Can someone ELI5? I don't really use twitter and I've never heard of fenix. ","Fenix is a Twitter client. In order to use the Twitter API (to read and post tweets and so on) the dev needs to obtain a secret key from Twitter. This key is baked into the app. When a user logs in with an app for the first time, Twitter adds that app (via that key) to your account. Only 100K (iirc) people may log in with any given app; after that no new user (ie someone who has never logged in with that app) may log in with that app, unless either a) someone removed that app from their account, or b) the dev asks Twitter to get more logins for their app (which they can reject of course).","Thank you. That sure does sound like it will back some devs into a corner. It seems like either twitter has a problem with spammers masquerading as 3rd party apps or they just really don't like them.","If spammers used their own fake apps, Twitter could revoke that secret key (any tweet is associated with the app it was posted from). No, I think they want to make people use their own app, which has no limits but serves ads to users (from which Twitter gains revenue, unlike with ads in 3rd party clients).","What's stopping them from saying, \"Twitter clients that don't display our ads will have their API keys revoked\"?\n\nThey could monitor all the popular apps, and test them at random every so often to make sure they were complying.","That would kill them pretty much instantly. Some people paid good money for their Twitter clients (7 apps across 4 platforms for me); if they started displaying mandatory ads in the Twitter stream, people would get pissed. If Twitter said \"devs can pay us [amount] so they don't need to display our ads\" many devs would probably abandon their apps, pissing users off.","So what you're saying is Twitter devs and users what to have their cake and eat it too?","Right? While this token stuff is definitely the wrong way of going about it, they do have to do *something*. And I don't expect too many people are willing to pay for Twitter. Ads are really the only way to go for them.","But people buy paid apps. People would pay for twitter, Twitter never capitalized on it.","I really don't think they would. Specially considering that the age of a really big part of their usebase is pretty young. \n\nThen there's also that it wouldn't be sustainable to make it a one time buy. Server costs are an ongoing thing, if they charged, say, 99 cents once, eventually the users would still cause a net loss for them. So, it would have to be a subscription type of service. Which I believe pretty much no one would bother to subscribe to.","That wouldn't kill them lol. Most people use the official app","&gt; What's stopping them from saying, \"Twitter clients that don't display our ads will have their API keys revoked\"?\n\nNothing, and no it wouldn't \"kill them\".","At the same time, Twitter only makes money from ads. When people use third party apps, they use the product without bringing any revenue.\n\nTwitter should probably make the API access paying. ","Yeah, I think that's a fair compromise.  It's what Imgur is doing, now, but people aren't exactly happy about it.","They don't want people to use third party apps at all, they really want them to use their own app.","What's to stop the dev from masquerading as a browser and scraping/pushing the data over https rather than using their shitty api?","The API is documented, the website is not. Twitter may change the website at any point without prior notice, something it can't do with the API. Even if someone had written a parser for the website that transforms the website into a fake API, there's no guarantee whatsoever that it'll be working tomorrow, let alone five minutes from now.  \nAlso I'd almost bet a tenner that scraping contents off the website is against their T&amp;C.","&gt; Except as permitted through the Twitter Services, these Terms, or the terms provided on dev.twitter.com, you have to use the Twitter API if you want to reproduce, modify, create derivative works, distribute, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or otherwise use the Twitter Services or Content on the Twitter Services.\n\nThough you could just post .apk's manually on github or something (Because I assume the gplay store won't allow applications that bypass the twitter API). What are they going to do about it, if you act like a normal browser?","They could notice it because the browser would only ever request the site, but not the ressources like images and stylesheets. And like I said, a minor change in the structure of the website can easily throw off a parser, requiring an update of the client. What I'm also wondering about: how would you go about posting tweets? You'd have to parse the website and its scripts figure out how to emulate sending a tweet, that's another thing Twitter can easily break for you.","Yeah. The mobile version might be simpler to parse.\n\nI'm not saying it's easier than using the API, but you might just have no choice when the API is fucking awful.","or you can register your own fake app and get tokens like the old falcon pro app.","So does this mean the end of fenix? Or just new users?","I really hope this doesn't spell the end, the app will continue to function for current users but will the dev continue development without the incentive of new users?","He uses it too, so I hope not…","Note: I can't seem to find Fenix on the play store.\n","Missing for me too.

I really don't like your OFFICIAL app. The only reason I continue to use the twitter at all is programs like Fenix make it bearable. Kill this and others and guess what Twitter I won't bother to check you anymore. Which is probably why you are stuck at 300 million users and your stock price has tanked. ","You want to use Twitter in a way they can't monetize but still eats up their resources. Why should they care about you?","Because their stockholders will leave if they don't have the userbase (much less a growing userbase.) I'm not gonna use Twitter if they kill off all the actually decently implemented apps. Mind you, I've used it since 2012.","Their stockholders will also leave if Twitter continues to not make money. You and I (third party app users) contribute to twitters operating costs but provide them no monetary value. ","If their app wasn't such garbage, then I'd have no problems using it. They'd make money if they did anything actually in the interest of developers and users.\n\nAs it stands, I use a third party app because theirs is awful. Just yesterday I had to remove its notification access because I was getting tweets in my notifications -- and I looked to disable it. The only option that'd do that? Was already disabled. They can't agree on a consistent color for the navbar... something you'd see a good majority of the time you use their app.\n\ntl;dr: I'd use their app if it wasn't worse than using Falcon Pro (the original one, mind you) despite how broken it is.","I'm aware their app is terrible, that doesn't change the fact that they are bleeding money and third party apps provide no value to them. I don't like their policies either but we are frankly lucky they haven't just shut down the API all together. ","Why can't 3rd party apps make them money? How does twitter make money anyway, I'm guessing ads? Assuming it is ads, why can't they make those ads part of the feed API so that for every 5 or so tweets you get an ad, and this happens on anything using their API(their app, website, or any 3rd party)?","Twitter makes money largely on sponsored ads that are injected into your feed/timeline.\n\nThey appear as sponsored ads and you have the ability to hide the ones you don't like to twitter can tailor adds to you.\n\nHonestly Twitter is one of the few services I don't mind ads on. They aren't intrusive and take up the space of anything else. I just scroll past like any other tweet I don't like.\n\nWhy Twitter can't just serve those ads into a users API feed I don't know. I'm betting it has something to do with how they collect ad analytics on their backend, the ads are placed in the feed via a different method from just calling the general followed user feed, or some security or data constraint they are worried about exposing via the API.\n\nSomeone who has worked with the twitter API or one a system like twitter with UGC vs Sponsored content might be able to explain better why they don't just host ads into 3rd party services.","Looks like Fenix has been removed from the Play Store?","Just checked, it's removed ","Probably the dev remove it himself to not have to deal with refunds of new users not being able to login.\n\nFor people who has installed the app at least once it should be under \"My Apps\" or in their account in the purchased section.","Pick up the red telephone, MKBHD! Call in some favors! ","Would it be possible for them to make the API key configurable like [Twidere](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mariotaku.twidere) does it? Just pick one from [the official ones](https://gist.github.com/mariotaku/5465786) and you are good to go.","Thought replies from tweets do not load, or are limited","I'm glad for the guy, since the app is great, it means that A LOT of people are using it and enjoying it.\n\nCouldn't he just publish a whole parallel version with another slew of new tokens?","yep, but that's against T&amp;C.","[Sort of Poetic](http://i.imgur.com/k44BVjd.png)","It's an older article, and geared towards an iOS audience, [but here's a good read on how the token system impacts developers](http://9to5mac.com/2014/11/25/twitterrific-5-twitters-war-on-developers/).","It's amazing how Twitter continues their bullshit API policies while their own app is still messy as hell and they keep announcing stuff that just disappoints their users. ","The twitter app really peaked. I used to like it a lot. It was straight forward. Here is your timeline, here is your messages, notifications, profile, search, trending topics. The core of what made twitter twitter.\n\nHad some UI revisions. A few small changes in how the timeline functioned (only loading the last few hundred tweets, having to click to load more) but I was still pretty ok with that.\n\nNow it is just kinda clunky. They moved icons like favorite to weird places. Added all this moments crap which is hard to distinguish between trending topics on moments. Some other small stuff that has ticked me off but can't recall now.","What I wonder every time when I read such news: how does Tapbot handle this issue with TweetBot on iOS? Are agreements with Twitter possible?","Going by what others have said in this thread with regards to Falcon Pro, I think Tapbot release a new app by jumping from version 3 to 4, to bypass Twitters token limit. Just a theory so I could be wrong.\n\nThere are other reasons for releasing different versions - devs got to get paid for their work.","I thought Tweetbot was about before the token limit so they basically have an unlimited limit due to being grandfathered in.","If I recall, this is actually correct. I recall this being said when Falcon Pro 1 died.","Nah, all apps are subject to the tokens. ","The 100,000 user limit only applies to new apps. TweetBot is older than the limit so they get double the amount that they had at the time of the cap","Twitter isn't doing really well right now, policies like this make it worse. ","Go with Talon's route, fenix plus, he's already has the audience, just make a new app plus a new added features and keep updating the original version.","This is why I hate Twitter. Third party apps have this issue and the main app has too many advertisements and spam for me to want to use it. ","Also third party apps don't work anymore. No polls. No group chat. You only get basic functionality with third party clients forcing you to use the Twitter app.","Out of the loop: Can someone explain what Fenix is and what Twitter Tokens are?","Third party twitter clients access it via an API, but you can't just walk up to it as a random device/app and get info from it, you must identify with a token. A twitter app developer registers his app on twitter's developer site, and from then on that app's users are assigned tokens that let them access twitter via its API through that particular app. This is how twitter can say \"posted with Fenix for Android\" or whatever - it knows what tokens apply to what third party app. \n\nSicne twitter's app has room for improvement (and heavily spams the user with ads), third party twitter clients at one point more or less outweighed twitter's own app in usage. Like a spoilt child twitter decided to limit the number of tokens allocated to each app. So now if third party apps get popular enough, they reach this limit and thus can get no more users since no more tokens can be applied to them. \n\nSome apps are now getting around this by instructing the user to create their own \"app\" on twitter's developer website, then to input their token which the third party app then sends.\n\nTwitter's more recent act of revenge against third party apps is essentially putting holes in the data that it gives via its API. If you use a third party app, you will not see all of the tweets that you would on the website for example.","Thanks a bunch!","Fenix is the best Twitter Client ever.","Good to know, now that I'll never be able to use it.  :'( ","Talon is a great option too","I prefer Tweetbot on iOS, personally. I was always hoping to see an Android version, but with these token limits I'm not sure it's even worth it for TapBots to take the time to do it if they'll just be capped on Android regardless. ","They've explicitly told me that they were never going to make Tweetbot for Android. One of the main guys more or less actively despises the platform.","Thanks, MKBHD.","Praetor Fenix? *He yet lives*?!?!","The developer just might start asking the users to register an API token on the app.","Twitter still seems to not be learning not to buttfuck 3rd party developers, it seems.","Twitter wants you to use their first party app. They couldn't give any less fucks. ","This always happens to the best apps, I miss using carbon","Aww, man, I wanted to try Fenix after seeing it in Marques Brownlee's videos! Guess I'll have to stick with Plume.","Sad, but one idiot in the comments put a fisting photo... At least i was not in front of anyone...","What are the drawbacks to the official twitter app and what are some alternatives to the same?","Official app\n\npros: \n\n* push notifications\n* polls integration\n* GIF search\n* Twitter cards integration\n* No rate limits\n\ncons:\n\n* No mute of keywords,, apps or hashtags only users\n* The old app is ugly (the new one with MD is OK)\n* Ads in Timeline\n* Ads in Tweets detail view\n\nAlternatives, Talon\n\nPros\n\n* Way better design and animations (MD)\n* Dark theme with auto night mode\n* GIF search\n* UX based on gesture (wipe down to close tweet view)\n* No ads\n* You can mute everything, from users to keywords\n\ncons\n\n* No push notifications\n* Stream notifications drain too much battery\n* No polls\n* No Twitter cards\n* Rate limits (five refreshes every 15 minutes or so)\n* Its paid\n","Fenix for Twitter was the best 3rd party Twitter client on Andriod. Will be sad if development stops. ","Can someone ELI5 this token thing? ","When you create an app, specifically for Twitter, you're assigned 100,000 user tokens. What these tokens are is a key to the app, really. Much like a CD Key for a game. You can only use it once per user. When you reach the 100,000 user limit, no more 'new' users can access the app. That's more like an ELI15, but I hope that helps. ","Yes it does! And why does Twitter do this? So that no Twitter app becomes more popular than theirs? ","That's what everyone thinks anyway. I feel the same way. They saw that third-party apps were gaining popularity compared to their shitty offering and decided to limit it. ","From a business standpoint it makes sense... Yeah, it sucks for all of us, but at the same time Twitter still needs to make money. Instagram has similar rules for their API. For example you can't make another Instagram client just to try to be better than the first party one, it has to be focused on something other than content (i.e. follower counts).","That's so utterly ridiculous. ","What twitter does less is what makes it great. You go to it for humor, news, and public dialogue. That's it. No grandmas, way less advertisement (unless you follow them), no \"pages\" your stupid high school friends share, few people care if you follow them back on twitter. You can tailor it way better and easier by simply choosing what to follow without the concept of \"friends\". Who the fuck wants to read 7 paragraphs when you can just type the main idea and then a bit.ly to the main article?\n\nIMO far superior platform for spreading the word.","Well they have to monetize somehow.

Many years ago, a person I know got on facebook and suggested I did too. I initially got part-way through creating an account, but then thought better of it and without ever finishing my profile or using facebook I went through the process to get the account closed, which should have deleted all data. I have recently found facebook emails in my spam folder which make reference to what little I had said then, and which also means they never wiped my email address from their records. Facebook is a black hole for your private data. Very powerful entities want you to feed them that. Don't. It's a bad idea. Facebook was even (indirectly, as usual) funded by the CIA, and if you think I'm joking or a conspiracy nut, then carry on, citizen, nothing to see here, move along. \n\ntl;dr: Facebook is cancer.","&gt; conspiracy nut\n\nWell, carrying on them!\n\nI don't really care if advertisements targeting me are more accurate.","Yep, that's all that's at stake. Exactly. \n\nNobody google this shit.","Not if any tweet that has more than 300 character has a 'Read More' label attached, so it doesn't take up your page.

I got there in the nick of time.","That's not a dilemma","Situation, problem, choice. ","A dilemma = a hard choice. I don't see how the choice you presented is hard to make; stagnation and eventual death vs making the product more appealing.","In the UK at least, before Twitter was a thing, they used to offer email addresses and phone, text and fax numbers. Some, like the BBC, ran discussion forums.\n\nI wish they'd go back to that (well, okay, maybe not fax)","Oh wow. Good to know. That's really a shame, because I do love me some Tweetbot.

It's a very well thought out view of what is happening with twitter.  \n\n4-24-2016\n\nWell said and bravo!","Agree, Twitter filled a brief space when Facebook wasn't cool. Now we have snapchat and facebook is kinda cool again. Twitter is done. ","Snapchat is so completely different to what Twitter or fb provide I always find it hilarious when people use it as a source to prove that Twitter and fb are dead.\n\nEspecially since to almost everyone that isn't in school Snapchat is a funny gimmick toy at best you occasionally use when inspiration strikes. It's literally vine but static images that have an expiration. That doesn't make much of a dedicated social network except for the bubbly personality types who are in clique centric social circles that you usually only see in school settings.\n\n","I never understood how Snapchat became as big as it is. It was just a service to pseudo-securely send nudes. Now it's got all the Discover nonsense, and some news outlets like Al Jazeera even have their snap code as their avatar on Facebook.","You can actually send payments through it now, it's called Snapcash. Some of my friends say it's especially convenient for paying for things/substances that aren't always legal. since your comment mentioned nudes I'm sure you can guess what else people are using the payment option for. ","I worry that Snapchat is the start of me being old and not getting certain pieces of technology, haha. I'm only in my thirties but I don't quite get why it's preferable to Messenger or text messaging (aside from the vanishing pics, of course). I tried it out but found the UI crappy and nothing particularly superior to other apps. ","I'm only 20 and I find Snapchat pointless. So, don't feel bad. It's just not for you and me.","Was it ever really about sending nudes though? I mean obviously some people did that and still do but that can be said about any messaging platform or honestly the internet as a whole.\n\nThe interesting thing about Snapchat is that is allows you to share your life in a more personal, honest and less curated way. Where FB and Instagram is all about presenting the best version of your life to the world Snapchat allows you to just share without worrying about anything.\n\nThis is why it seems to really resonate with younger people because FB is where you now have all of your family and coworkers and everything is documented forever and accessible to anyone who even remotely knows you.\n\nI'm in my mid 20's and enjoy using it on a pretty casual basis with just a few select people and find the Stories feature an interesting way to share things that would be funny or interesting to people who I know well but I totally understand why it's so popular with the younger generation.","Exactly.. I'm in my late 30s. I don't know anyone my age who uses Snapchat, and if I did I would think there was something wrong with them. It's for teeny boppers only","There is a huge portion of people in their 20s using snapchat.","I use Snapchat occasionally w/ friends (I'm 24 BTW), but primarily I use it to follow marketing thought-leaders. All in their early/mid 40's &amp; 50's and I have gotten SO much useful content from them.\n\nSnapchat has more monthly active users than Twitter and simply writing off the platform which has the most of the attention of the 16-30 y/o market is pretty idiotic if you're a marketer at all. Go watch some of Gary Vaynerchuk's videos if you want to understand how important Snapchat is. It's the same \"I don't understand it so it's stupid\" argument. It's how you get old and stuck in the past.","Sure, a marketer wants to be in front of as many eyeballs as possible, and so I would expect one to endorse Snapchat\n\nI understand what it is, I just think it's a level of nonsense where I have no business or desire being","here is the thing, They never said they didn't understand it, they said it was for younger people. \nI'm 33, and I keep right up to date with tech of all types, and I understand snapchat perfectly. I have friends who are younger who use it, and a vast majority of friends closer to my own age who just don't give a shit. \n\nThe thing that is going on here, is not that people in thier 30's don't understand it, it just that typically they have moved into a phase of life where the never ending posturing, mating dance, status seeking, identity establishment and searching for what is \"cool\" that nearly EVERYONE does in their 20's is pretty much done with. Most of us are in longer term relationships or married, and are self-confident enough that we don't care nearly as much about our image as a 20 something or a teen anymore, because we have figured that stuff out (well some of us just think we have.) \nEither way, I promise, when you hit your thirties, you will care a lot less as well about keeping your peeps up to date with you latest antics, being cool and all that sort of shit. \n\nSnapchat appeals to that demographic, its hip, its happening, its cool etc, but it is like nightclubs. There is a reason why people over 30 are much much less common as its userbase. and it isn't because people over 30 don't get it. \n\nAh the arrogance of youth - you forget we already did it, you just get bored of the stuff you find exciting in your 20's eventually and move onto deeper things.","You act like you're \"all knowing\" and \"went through it\" but I run a digital marketing company so I deal with social media and online marketing for companies. You could have said the same shit about Facebook when it first came out, Instagram too. Facebook was geared toward college kids and that was the main demographic. It went through it's \"cool\" stage and then slowly got older. Now the largest demographic that uses Facebook actively is 35-65 y/o females. I'm sure you saw that coming back in the day though when Facebook was in the middle of it's life cycle..\n\nI love how many people think they \"understand\" social media when in reality they have no idea. And no, you don't \"understand it\" . Just because you think you know what it's \"about\" and aren't interested doesn't mean you \"understand it\" . It's where marketing has moved to because it's where people are now spending their attention instead of billboards and TV. In 3-5 years, snapchat is going to move up to an older demographic, mid 30's, 40's, 50's and you're going to see something else come and replace it for the younger demo. All social media goes in lifecycles if it manages to be alive long enough. Facebook and Instagram are two perfect examples of this. It has already been happening with Snapchat. Snapchat started as being a REALLY young demo, 12-17 y/o's and then social networks like \"Music.ly\" came out and that's where the younger demo flocked to while Snapchat started catching on with the early/mid 20 y/o demo.\n\nLike I said, 50% of the people I follow on Snapchat are marketing experts in their mid 40's and 50's. Look at people like DJ Khalid who gets 2+ million views per story. He's not a \"kid\". The platform is slowly moving up in demo as the older marketers jump into the platform trying to ruin it and make a buck.\n\nI don't have to convince you though. There's no reason to because you'll never believe it until it happens. I'll save it for my clients that actually have open minds when it comes to the way the world is and how things are moving.","DJ khaled is a weird example. People only follow him for memes ","You know nothing about me, and you claim with such assurance that I don't get it? And you accuse me of not getting it?

This is purely anecdotal, but most of the people I've met in my 10 years in Japan are much more active on Facebook than Twitter, but that wasn't always the case.

In order to use the Twitter API (to read and post tweets and so on) the dev needs to obtain a secret key from Twitter. This key is baked into the app. When a user logs in with an app for the first time, Twitter adds that app (via that key) to your account. Only 100K (iirc) people may log in with any given app; after that no new user (ie someone who has never logged in with that app) may log in with that app, unless either a) someone removed that app from their account, or b) the dev asks Twitter to get more logins for their app (which they can reject of course).","This is 100% correct.

","Same for any company, but it's like movie companies wanting a shangri-la of no pirating.

If you program an app to scrape the website from the app you're already in a losing battle. If they change the API slightly, you'd need to push an entirely new app, which for Apple takes over a week. \n\nAnyone who does this would have their own server that they control, and the app would make standard requests to and from their own server, which is then responsible for scraping/whatever Twitter. If they make a change, you update your server in one place and all your apps start working again. Gplay won't know what you're doing behind the scenes. \n\nThat said, it definitely violates their ToS so I don't see anyone getting traction doing this in the first place. Any app that gets the attention of Twitter will immediately be sued and that dev will lose, hands down. ","Why the fuck would they do this?","What is stopping people from decompiling the official app and mimicking it's behavior to access these private APIs?","So if I download Fenix again and try to sign in, will I be denied? Or is this just for people logging in for the first time?","Just for new purchases.  If you bought it before, you still have a token.","Did they change that to only new users? I thought tokens were logins in general. Only because I used another 3rd party app for around 5 months, then all of a sudden could no longer use the app because I was getting an error saying they had no more tokens. \n\nIt worked out for twitter I have stopped suing 3rd party apps, because they can't be relied on to work since twitter puts on a token limit.","Eh, call it \"limited edition.\"","SAME!!","That's... Probably not true","You think twitter would be here with out the third party apps? No, it's totally true","I know the argument is that mainstream users don't care about the third-party apps, but it would never have reached the point of mainstream users if they had not existed.","Know any mainstream users that still use sms to update their feeds? I don't know any. Haven't in years. ","Twitter's popularity and status comes from its use by celebrities and world known figures, not third party apps","It wasn't celebrities and world known figures that got twitter into the mainstream. It was the 3rd party developers that took it from something a handful of people used to tell their little part of the world something that was on their mind. Third party developers made it into something that allowed people to actually read what other people had to say and join in on conversations. Before third party apps you couldn't even post a photo to twitter. You had to use sites like TwitPic, location...ha you had tools like Google's latitude and that one iOS app that would link geolocation (Sorry, I forget it's name).\n\nCould you imagine actually trying to do that stuff without 3rd party apps? Don't forget twitter is/was based on SMS and didn't have their own 1st party app until they purchased the iOS app tweetie in april of 2010 and tweetdeck in may of 2011. a full 4-5 years after they opened shop in July of 2006. During that time it was the 3rd party apps that made twitter usable.\n\nSo no. It wasn't celebrities and world known figures that got it into mainstream. It was third party developers. The celebrities and world knowns only joined once they realized there was this huge platform of people tweeting photos of their dinner using TwitPic that they could reach out to.","What are you talking about? There's a first part application that the vast majority of users use. Twitter would still be huge without third party apps.","there is NOW, the first 4-5 years there was SMS and the webapp. The real use came from mobile apps and desktop apps like TweetDeck. And the first party apps were 3rd party apps that Twitter bought up.","So can't Fenix acquire (buy?) more tokens from Twitter to support their growth? ","They can ask them for more (no idea if that costs something) but Twitter has rejected some of these requests in the past for mundane reasons (one popular client was deemed too similar to their own app or some bullshit reason).","Yikes..

Yesterday I literally was just telling people in this sub to try Fenix.... :(","yeah.....Nah.","Found the fellow kiwi... ;)","Oh, hello tasmania 2.0 resident :)","I just wants to throw it out there that like Facebook and Reddit (to differing degrees) Twitter inserts its left wing political views onto its platform, sometimes covertly, making it far from an impartial news and information site.

Maybe the next incarnation of micro blogging or whatever the hell it is, will be more free and open.","Can you give an example of how they do this?","They delete rising hashtags that are popular and right wing oriented, such as anti Hillary Clinton hashtags, just after a debate. They have taken away visibility and the offered status of tweets by taking sway verified status of writers on the political right.","Hahahahahahahha this is about milos checkmark isn't it \n\nToo funny","Well the problem here is you seem to have confused a social media website with an impartial news and information website,  lmao","No confusion. Its Twitter, the company, quietly suppressing or elevating trending topics, as a company, not the users. That's my whole point. It has become a partisan propaganda Outlet, and that's a shame. Itcoukd have been independent and impartial, then it would be a useful tool.","The tin foil hat must've been wrapped a bit too tightly when you dreamt this up. Twitter is used by lefties and righties alike with plenty of success on both sides. It's also a social network, not a \"news and information site.\" Whatever you are seeing on Twitter is what you want to see, whether you are actively following or not. I imagine that any time you might actually spend on Twitter is spent seeking out these lefties that you fear so you can disparage their opinions, and Twitter likely curates your content towards that. If you're only following users like Fox News, Ann Coulter, Hannity, etc., that's basically all you'll see. If anything, the argument could be made that it's a propaganda site for all types of propaganda, but it certainly doesn't skew one way or the other. You could, of course, just be upset about what's popular on Twitter, but that would be an issue with the users and not the network itself. ","Nope. Twitter has been,caught deleting accounts and eliminating the rise of hashtags that are unflattering to Hillary Clinton. Twitters CEO throws fundraising parties for her. They are also more willing to give 'verified' account status to those on the left and have punished political writers on the right for tweets that Twitter opposes, by taking already issued verified status' away! \n\nSo its exactly what I said and the opposite of what you said. Its not an open or fair platform. When I point out twitters manipulation of user opinions, you will fall back to saying its a social media site not a news site, but the corruption and manipulation is still there regardless. Its manipulating opinions of the users based on the owners political views.","Your paranoia is laughable. Is Twitter's CEO not allowed to have political views? Which accounts have they deleted that were completely within their stated guidelines? Why don't conservatives leave the platform if it is so incredibly unfair to them? Your comment about their willingness to give verified accounts to certain users is completely made up with zero basis in reality. Twitter doesn't flood you with random opinions. They flood you with ads. You see what you want to see on Twitter as far as users' political views go. \n\nThe only information I could fine to support your accusations was from incredibly, overtly biased right wing sites. Here is an example that I'm sure you've already read: http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/02/17/conservative-twitter-users-must-fight-back/\n\nIn that \"article\" the blogger claims that \"inside sources\" confirmed what you've claimed, but they give no evidence whatsoever. The entire piece is really quite a joke with no supporting evidence other than Jack Dorsey had blue hair once and went to Ferguson (oh, the horror!). Perhaps you should take a moment to consider the world in a different light. Things aren't black and white. Liberal vs. conservative isn't good vs. evil. The entirety of the mainstream isn't out to get you, and they certainly aren't out to brainwash everyone. I find it troubling that you needed to mention Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Have you also taken note of SnapChat's insane left-leaning ways? What about Instagram? I'm sure it's only a matter of time. Or maybe it's worth considering that the majority of users on these sites are young people, and the majority of young people are socially, liberally-minded. Give them time to grow up and hate/fear the rest of the world as much as you do. ","In case you are curious about the verified checkmark thing, he is referring to the \"journalist\" milo yiannopoulos, who got his verified mark revoked after he broke twitters user policy (unsurprisingly, he works for the same super biased conservative site you already linked, lmao)","That's pretty much what I expected. Thanks. Lol. ","Twitters CEO is allowed to,have political views. Has allowed to manipulate public opinion on the platform.

Im just deriving the obvious opinion after reading about twitters behavior. \n\nYour arguing as if Twitter us the free and open platform that it appears to be. Im,telling you its not. And your one google away from knowing that. \n\nOh and hate and fear? Sure. Anti Hillary Clinton trending topics get deleted because Im a redneck filled with hate and fear.

Your troubled for the wrong reason. \n\nAnd its silly that your complaining that sites are biased. First, the information on them is true or false. Pretty simple. Second. My,while point is that Twitter is biased, but covertly. You can see breibart as biased but refuse to believe Twitter can be too? \n\nPerhaps you should see the world in a different light.

Please provide me with some evidence that isn't tied to a right-wing biased outlet, OR provide some evidence that isn't just from \"sources\". Lol. \n\nI'm guessing you meant to say \"feeds\" instead of \"fees\", but a poll passed around by Facebook employees is hardly worthy of the fear-mongering that you've clearly fallen victim to or the fear you're trying to peddle yourself. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's apparent that you are a very close-minded, fearful individual and I'm not going to be able to open your eyes via Reddit. My suggestion is that you simply stop using those platforms and tell all of your like-minded friends to do the same. I would be so happy if you could convince Ann Coulter to stop tweeting. Don't get your panties in a bunch, though. I was just joking. I'm not trying to silence one side of the political spectrum. \n\nFor funsies, here's a link to the list of the most influential politician journalists on Twitter and it's riddled with lefties and righties alike.

Some of my lists get crazy cluttered. ","Great! It will have a chance to rise from ashes :)","Darn. Wanted to buy it a few days ago due to their sale... or was it falcon ? ","Yup. Same here, and this has been the case for years.","Question. if I log off of fenix will my token be forfeited?","No.","I can disable retweets on twidere.","Twicca does it, but you have to enable it for each user (tedious).","It says not available in the US","It totally did for Falcon pro. He created Falcon pro 3 which required everyone to buy it again to get updates.

I swore off anything made by that dev after he pulled the bait-and-switch.","Welcome to reddit! /s","Then they need to find a way to make money in third party apps. I don't know how Twitter normally makes money(haven't been on in about 3 years), but I'm guessing ads. Put the ads or whatever they do to make money into the feed by definition, or at least in some way where it's not dependent on using their app to get money. If the API to get tweets automatically pulls an ad for every 5 tweets or whatever, then any app, theirs or falcon or whatever, they all make them money. \n\nIf that's not how this works or there's a reason that wouldn't work, please let me know. ","Can I get a EIL5?","&gt; Fenix is a Twitter client. In order to use the Twitter API (to read and post tweets and so on) the dev needs to obtain a secret key from Twitter. This key is baked into the app. When a user logs in with an app for the first time, Twitter adds that app (via that key) to your account. Only 100K (iirc) people may log in with any given app; after that no new user (ie someone who has never logged in with that app) may log in with that app, unless either a) someone removed that app from their account, or b) the dev asks Twitter to get more logins for their app (which they can reject of course).","Ty\n","&gt; You faked an app and it rode on the back of Falcon Pro, totally skirting Twitter's asinine limitation.\n\nI suppose this is what you have to do when you're essentially only making money off of others work.  Just like they say with the cloud, you don't own it so don't rely on it.","That's not luck. It's just not an option for them at this point; a good portion of users will stop using Twitter (again, myself included. I know several people who would do the same) if they kill off the API. \n\nThey'll continue to bleed money, unless they treat developers better, and say, offer to remove the token limit + small revenue, like Youtube ads, for promoted tweets being in their apps every, say, 500 tweets. Will that be a turnoff for some people? Yes. Would it help solve their bleeding money *AND* users problem? Also yes. There are solutions to their problems, they're just not willing to do them because they lose something; I am not saying my solution is a good one, but there are solutions.","What will happen now? Will it be back on the play store?","He works for Twitter, so I assume they know. Interesting to see if someone else tries it though.","Tweetie (It's just a third party client bought by Twitter and made official) has gone a long way and soon it will have real material design and night mode on stable (non Betal. I'm having very little problems with Twitter right now!","Their stockholders will leave if they don't make money, too.","Twitter will be dead in one way or another in 2 years. They lack a profitable business model and will be bought out by someone and turned into a service rather than an end product (think like Slack or Hipchat, but for festivals or small events). They can't figure out how to make enough money to offset costs, and they're going to run out of investment eventually.","Thanks! That cleared it up pretty well! ","What are tokens?","Anyone got a link to the APK? I've downloaded it before so there's a token on my Twitter account but I've just reinstalled my phone and the app is no longer on the Google Play Store :(","Its a paid app, sharing the apk is piracy, look on you Play store account or in the My apps -&gt; All","I suspect that somewhere in the app setting is the place to insert a pair of hash strings that id the developer and app. Anyone can sign up for a developer and app id with Twitter for free.","Because without users they are nothing. ","Without users seeing ads they are nothing. ","They're losing millions of dollars a year; **With** users, they're less than nothing.","Seriously throw in ads in my stream if it helps the bottom line.  The official app is crap compared to these 3rd party options. ","Will the users who got Fenix before tokens ended get effected?","No","How is that done? Did the author rerelease the app with a new package name and new Twitter API key, then just proceed to update both from the same codebase while directing new users to only use the new version?","I think he's just operating multiple API keys in one app. The old Falcon Pro was unlisted but those that bought it can still download it.","Does falcon pro make you pay for each Twitter account? Holy shit.","I think you pay for the first one and then if you want to use more than one account a second purchase unlocks that. You wouldn't have to pay for the third account.","Because even if they don't make money of a third party user directly, they profit from having a high user base (because of the profitable customers a large community attracts). Losing users costs them one way or another.","That's only if the net gain from those additional profitable users offsets the number of unprofitable. I'm guessing if they have an API limit, it's because they don't.\n\nTwitter has been losing money since the beginning. Ads or not, they've never managed to be profitable.","Glad I bought Fenix a while ago.\n\nTbh the official Twitter app is fine. I would be using it if there was no ad.","i would be using it if it had nightmode.","That too ","That's what I was going to say. I'm surprised Twitter hasn't caught on to this","For a day, week, or month; until the existing users update, and new users round out the ones that stopped using the old app.","Existing users wouldn't \"update,\" just give it a new bundle identifier and set the version string to the same as the current version of the main app. When it's time to make an update to both apps, just `git cherry-pick`","Nah, you would have the app fire up and establish a ssl connection with your own server, at which time you'd transmit the app id you've associated with that user account.

","I can see the functionality of that, but I would not really call any of that *news,* but more punditry/commentary. \nlets be honest though, a lot of sports fans (present company excepted) wouldn't know what RSS was if it smacked them upside the back of the head, so I think in that case twitter is probably the most accessible solution.","What twitter apps are fenix users moving towards now that support is dead?

As far as \"The Chain\" goes, there is an incredible demo of this that has a slow instrumental build; highly recommended.","Holy shit, yes! Everyone likes to put Tusk down but I think it is truly some of their best songwriting especially for Stevie (even though the album was Lindsey's baby).","Big shout out for The Ledge, mainly because of its bonkers production: http://youtu.be/DuQFnVKrHuY\n\n","My 4 year old knows Tusk by the first bar and runs to the speaker! ","I absolutely agree.  Engineering and production feats aside, of all those period albums, Tusk still sounds new.  This probably has to do with its post-punk/ new wave edge paired with their signature song craft.  Who knows, but it speaks to me on an entirely different level.  I only hope these will get the Steve Hoffman Half-Mastered treatment soon.","that sounds amazing, you got a link?","https://youtu.be/CEIEFdNg7ZA","It's an album all about people cheating on each other. It's fantastic. ","Used to make a 2.5hr drove quite regularly to see my SO when she was in teachers college.

Never was that more true than with Rumours. They were able to capture lightning in a bottle.","I agree. Rumours has been one of my favourite albums since I was a kid, just amazing, timeless songs.\n\nI listened to the album on vinyl the other day (it was playing at a friend's house), and man, it sounds so good compared to digital! It has a totally different feel and texture, and there's so many details you don't notice on the digital copy. I haven't had much exposure to vinyl recordings but now I want a record player, so I can listen to classic albums like Rumours and know how they sounded originally.","Mind you, they did make some of their best music back then...","Rumours?","No, that's all true","The Force, the Jedi, all of it","Are you guys fuckin' with me?","Na dude, Star Wars is based on a premonition Stevie Nicks had while writing songs that would later become the album 'Rumors' by Fleetwood Mac.","Just in case you haven't seen it, here's the scene from Flight of the Conchords...

Gold Dust Woman is the best song on the album IMO","You Make Lovin' Fun for me!","Hell yes. The Chain is just finishing, and you're thinking \"How can they top this?\"\n\nThen the bass kicks in. Oh lawd.","I know.  Best part of the song is the bass solo followed by the all out rock out ending","Underdog pick. I like it.","Songbird is one of the most beautiful songs ever written to me and what I think is the best song on Rumours. It may be my 2nd favorite Fleetwood Mac song of all time (next to Beautiful Child on the Tusk album) but, seriously, the whole album is magic.","I agree, I love that song the most. I got to go to their show when they came to Phoenix a couple of years ago and Christine had rejoined their tour. I didn't think they were going to play it but it was one of the very last songs they played. She still sings it just as beautifully.","Dreams is the best song on the album though.","You sure are spelling \"Never Going Back Again\" in a weird way. \n\nJokes aside, that's what makes it so good, you could ask a bunch of people what their favorite song on the album is and get 11 different responses. ","Lol I agree though. Never Going Back Again is one of the greatest pop songs of all time","That is by far my favorite Fleetwood Mac song","Who the hell is picking I Don't Want to Know?\n\nIt's a fine song and all, but it's a big step down from the others.","I love it! Not only is it an essential piece in the album (something up-beat in the end of the album) but it's also a simple rock-song whose rhythm I love.\n\nSure it's a big step downwards lyrically but I think it makes up for it with it's composition.","Yeah that's all good, but...favorite?","Favorite is a bit of a strong word, but 'I Don't' was the song that made me listen to Rumours, so for me it's special at the least.","I don't agree about that particular song, but I understand where you're coming from.","You spelled Second Hand News wrong.","Doesn't mean it has to be his favorite. Though. ","Silver Springs would've been the best song on the album if it hadn't been left off in my opinion. The Chain is tops for me otherwise. ","Gypsy and Big Love are pretty good too","Dreams was almost cut ","Those 3 voices came together so well in this song.","Tango in the night was a fantastic concert, I saw them in Detroit in the late 80's. All their stuff is gold. ","Ugh, I freakin' love that album. I envy you that got to see them in concert ;(","do you remember?","...the 21st night of September?","THE FACE OF A PRETTY GIRL","Actually though the solo in that song is so good","It was the best concert I ever experienced!","One of the greatest rock albums ever","It defined the summer of 77 for me.  \n\nHad a vinyl and 8-track copy, we wore that tape out playing songs over and over, particularly this one.","This album was the first tape my parents ever bought and the also wore it out playing it so much in the car. I did the same things by with my Joshua Tree album in the 80s lol","I was born in 77 and this my favorite album of all time.  I heard it in the womb, when I was a child, through adolescence and into adulthood.  I still listen to it regularly.  The Chain is my favorite song, but the whole album is perfection.","Heard this song watching The Americans the other day, they played it during a snatch and grab op, a lot of visceral emotion occurred in that scene, it was all so excellent.","The Americans also did a particularly good job with Fleetwood Mac's \"Tusk\" in the pilot episode.","That scene combined with that music is what hooked me on The Americans","The Chain and Tainted Love scenes are two of my favourites in The Americans. ","Their live performances of this song are usually better than the album version, imo. Like on the opening of 'The Dance'. Needs good headphones with some decent  bass to get full effect.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/lpVCL00fPAc","The Dance is how I first got into Fleetwood Mac years ago after searching through all of my mom's CDs. I loved it so much I bought the DVD. It's such an amazing live performance.","Me too! I basically grew up on the live album. My parents had that on CD, but most of the others were on records and i wasn't allowed to use the record player as a kid. Listened to The Dance so much that I prefer the live versions of most of the songs now. The live version of this song might be my favorite from Fleetwood Mac altogether. ","How the hell is that audience sitting down during this performance. I'd be standing ON my seat. ","I was a teenager when The Dance first aired, I think on VH1, and it was the year I'd first learned to play guitar. I was into mostly metal and industrial at the time, but had an ear for classic rock too, so I'd heard of Fleetwood Mac but never really listened to them.\n\nI watched this and I was hooked from the intro of The Chain all the way through the end. I remember seeing this and Big Love later on in the show and thinking, \"How the hell does he do that?\" I learned about Travis picking and practiced for years until I could finally nail both of those songs. This live show and album completely changed my personal playing style as a musician, and definitely hooked me into a more eclectic musical fandom where I was willing to draw inspiration from anything.\n\nThanks for posting this! Lindsey will forever make my list as one of the greatest guitarists of all-time, and most definitely in the top of the list of most underrated guitarists of all time.\n\n[Big Love, from The Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZp76M4NGc)","The bass solo is amazing!","John in such an under appreciated genius. I think he is one of the best bass players of all time but I may be a tad bias since they're my favorite band.","Every bass player I've ever played with has whipped this one out at least once in rehearsal.","Their song [Rhiannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_aYibUx1B8) and their live rendition of [Landslide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK2HAfb3rC0) are also fantastic","I was so annoyed the other day when i went to listen to both of those songs only to find I don't have a copy of \"Fleetwood Mac\" on LP...\n\nThat album plus Rumours are fantastic. ","\"The Dance\" is one of the best live albums of all time.  \n\nI grew up on that album, many hours riding with my parents absolutely SCREAMING along to [Tusk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrRVW-p8SJ8).  I can't even imagine how badass it must have been in person to see Mick Fleetwood come back out on stage and start banging that shit out.\n\nEdit: [This was what they played next in case anyone was wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgwRYjDhK_E)\n\nAlso amazing: [From their 2003 show in Boston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dff2XCh3Ass)  - Solidified Lindsey Buckingham as one of the most badass dudes alive IMO.  (As if [40 years of such performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5kOzGwsHXw) didn't do that already)\n\nEdit 2: Fuck it, here's more Fleetwood Mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRu7Pt42x6Y","It is THE best concert video I've ever seen.  I believe Stevie described the concert as, \"As magic as it gets...it was.\" I tend to agree.  That whole performance is amazing.  ","They're both always amazing live as is Silver Springs (but especially on The Dance). Landslide is going to be my father-daughter dance song for my wedding in July. Had to incorporate The Mac in there somehow!! :)","If you are too cool for Fleetwood Mac, you might just be too cool.","Saw them in Perth last year whilst it was pouring down rain, was fantastic, thoroughly enjoyed it.","This has always been my favorite song. I heard it for the first time while camping with a bunch of hooligans. Great introduction to music.","This one is great, but my favorites are Never Going Back Again and Gold Dust Woman.

","I just got an old pressing of the rumours vinyl, just amazing when you listen straight through it. ","This is one of my girlfriends favourite songs to have a drink to. She told me this after I told her one of mine was Dreams. I lucked in.","My favorite Saturday afternoon jam. \n\nFleetwood Mac always gets me going. ","Good old Steamy Nicks.","to the day it reminds me of damon hill in his williams car in formula one,the bridge used to be the opening music of F1 on the BBC when i was a kid. ","favorite part of 2015 was randomly hearing this on the radio in a heavy rainstorm just driving down the 5 in California. ","I wish music like this was still in fashion ... M83 tried to use this type of vibe in their new album, but it fell a little flat.","I'm pretty sure The Pixies based their entire sound on the outro of this song.","Bummmm Bum Bum BUM Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bummmmmm","That guitar solo is so damn good.","Oh, god, I love this song. My favorite is definitely the version off The Dance, though. Actually, The Dance is probably my absolute favorite Fleetwood Mac album ever.   \n\nMy best friend and I used to listen to it constantly. Her wedding song was actually Big Love (the guitar work on that song is nothing short of incredible). I remember that her parents used to make fun of us constantly because it was more their generation’s music than ours.  ","I feel like posting any song off of Rumours in this subreddit is like cheating haha ","Not sure if someone has already mentioned this but for those of you who love the Rumours album and this song in particular, check out the super deluxe album release and the demo version of The Chain. It's much different--only Stevie; acoustic. The riff in what we now know as The Chain is featured in a song that Christine sang, called Keep Me There. ","That bass line tho ","I cannot stop listening to this song! Plus im a huge fan of 80's music, classic rock, 80's pop, generally any 80's music especially Fleetwood Mac!","It's amazing that this album came out in 77, at that!  Rumours was so ahead of its time for sure.  ","Fleetwood Mac has been my favorite band since I was 15 years old (now 28) and I was so amazingly fortunate to get to see them live about 3 years ago. Gah! They're just so amazing. I still enjoy the music they're putting out more recently but nothing compares to Rumours. It's an untouchable album imo.","I've been a fan since I was about 15, too, though I'm a few years older than you (wocka wocka). I often joke that my memorabilia collection is my kids' college fund, but it's a joke because I can't see myself selling anything (I specialize in artwork/photography and records - I've even got all the old bootleg albums from the 70s). I've seen Stevie solo 5 times, Lindsey solo once, and the Mac as a whole twice. Perfection every time. I even got Lindsey to sign my Tusk lithograph - next to Stevie's Rhiannon painting, it is my most prized piece.","I've collected all of their LPs (and some before Lindsey, Stevie, and Christine joined) and a few of the their old posters but besides that I only have current concert/fan shirts. I am completely blessed to have such a sweet fiance who got me Fleetwood Mac tickets for our first Christmas together 3 years ago (which he always says he set the bar too high lol) and it was literally one of the highlights of my life. As soon as they started to perform I immediately broke into tears because I thought I'd never get the chance to see them. Of course, Christine wasn't with them at that concert and she rejoined shortly after we saw them (which is a bummer since Songbird is one of my favorite songs) but it was still amazing and they went for around 3 1/2 hours!!","\"Oh Well\" is the only Fleetwood Mac song I ever liked. That bassline was fucking sick. The rest of their music reminds me of all the other soft rock they played at my orthodontist's office in the early '90s. ","That's because that was a completely different band. The original line up, fronted by Peter Green, with Danny Kirwan joining later, was outselling both the Stones and The Beatles. Check out \"Rattlesnake Shake\", and \"The Green Manalishi\"  from *Live in Boston* to listen to them in their prime. ","\"Man of the world\" is also absolutely sickening song","I can't believe that slipped my mind, it's one of my favourites!","The night is so black that the darkness cooks","**DUH DE DUH DE DUH, DUH DUH**","That makes a lot of sense. I never understood why a band capable of such awesomeness wiild spend decades being not very awesome. Thanks for the info.","No problem! \n\nThe reason for the change in line up was essentially Green leaving for disputed reasons, Jeremy Spencer running off to join a cult (Children of God in LA I believe), and Kirwan becoming an alcoholic and uncooperative. There was a period that straddled the pop and the blues iterations which featured Bob Welch and Weston also.","The reason for the change in line up was essentially Green leaving for disputed reasons.......\n\nThis makes me so sad, I believe if Green hadn't have took that trip he'd have been recognised as one of the best, some have all the technique but no emotion, the opening of \"need your love so bad\" gets me everytime, same  as \"I loved another woman\"\n\n\"He's the only one who gave me the cold sweats\" ","Fleetwood Mac was much better before they got the chicks. Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.","I like to just think of them as two separate, awesome groups that shared a common name.  Kinda the opposite of Jefferson Airplane/Starship","For the life of me, I will never understand how this sub works.","That's okay. You'll be okay.","Why have I never heard of this band? I've been listening to my local classic rock radio station for years and never once heard of them. \n\nPeople keep mentioning *Rhiannon*. If that song is by Fleetwood Mac, then it's the only song of theirs I know since the station plays it like 20 times a week.\n\nAnyone recommend any of their albums? Other than *Rumours*, it's been mentioned in this thread multiple times.","Rhiannon was on the Fleetwood Mac (self titled) album. It is by Fleetwood Mac.  I find it crazy you've never heard of Fleetwood Mac.  My guess would be, you've heard a lot more of them than you probably recognize.  I suggest their greatest hits album and work from there. \n","There was a great version on the UK voice this year. I'm too stupid to link it sorry ","Hands up all those who only listen to the part of the song they use in formula 1 towards the end coz that bit is awesome but the rest of the song is kinda \"meh\""],["Greatest day of my life was spent at the Hatch Shell with 100,000 other people listening to them play their \"farewell\" concert.","Even though Chad forgot the words to the second verse -__- lol\n\nI was there too!","Me three! Awesome show/experience. It doesn't feel that long ago but I also remember it being the day after the first Boston MySpace party (yeah that was a thing) which makes me realise it was a long time ago now.","\"Hold on now fellas back it up for a minute...\" As a then-14 year-old obsessed with Dispatch, going to that show was pretty much the greatest day of my life. Good times","The water bottle fight was one of the most cool things I've seen in person.","That's right! I have a great pic of that. A couple idiots threw glass though and some people went to the hospital. ","One of those bands that are great in the studio, but just phenomenal live. So happy they have a lot of their discography on the live albums they've released.","Not sure if you've listened to the newest live release (Ain't No Trip to Cleveland) but it fully lives up to their (very high) standards. Love the live versions of their newer songs.","I have and I fully agree. Actually made a pretty lengthy trip to Chicago to see them live shortly after Ain't No Trip to Cleveland was released because I was so into it.","Greatest day of my life was when they came back and played at Red Rocks. Holy guacamole, what a show. ","I was there as well. Absolutely insane show. ","Me too! Drove from Southern California for it - it was out of this world.","I remember that concert well. It was the summer after my senior year in high school. I remember getting close to the concert, hearing all the people, but couldn't see them because it was at the top of a hill. I remember getting to the top of the hill and looking out at a sea of people and just thinking \"woaaah.\"\n\nI was with some buddies and a few girls. One of the girls, who was a little overweight asked me to put her on my shoulders. I remember in my head thinking... really? Is she serious? I tried. I toughed it out as long as I could. I think I lasted 3 minutes before my legs starting shaking and sweat was profusely pouring out of me.\n\n\nI also remember people started throwing bottles. And I mean everywhere. Just bottles flying like crazy. Even glass bottles here and there which freaked me out. They almost stopped the show like 3 times cause of it.\n\nGood show. We all thought they were kidding about retiring, but figured it was the perfect excuse for a road trip. I mean who spends so many years building up an audience. Living out of your van for years and years doing any and every show possible. And when the fruits of your efforts start to finally pay off and you are hitting it big. Boom, retire. Didn't make sense.

","2007-2008 is when it was popular in my town.","Huh, 2002 is when I was listening to Dispatch. ","yup 02-03 freshman in college soundtrack. ","02-03 freshman represent.","Same here maybe they hit the college scene first?","&gt; 2007-2008 is when it was popular within my circle of friends in my town.\n\nFTFY."," Thanks 😊","Oh yes, freshman/sophomore year of college (2003-2005) this album was everywhere at my school (well, my dorms/group of friends, anyway). ","I started college in 2002 and my bro roommate used my computer to download this song and burn it onto a CD.","2004. They were still pretty popular on the indie/jam band scene.","This album was 1998, and I know they were touring colleges nationwide before 2000.","O.A.R and Tom Petty would like to have a word with you. ","I graduated in 2015 and still heard this song at frats during my undergrad years. My roommates also bumped it a lot but they were a bunch of Massholes. ","Reminds me of college life but that doesn't make it generic right?","I'm not a dispatch fan, but I respect them. I think EDM is gross though, I'm old now and I just don't get it.","I've read that this is loosely based on a speech by Robert E. Lee toward the end of the civil war.","It was more that they wanted an anti•war song about the Gulf war and thought it was appropriate to use Lee's surrender as a base. At an LA concert they talked about the despair they felt over the inability to get out of a pointless war and wanted the song to convey the smart decision of the general to stop fighting when it was time.","That's interesting, I didn't know about the gulf war context.","I can't even guess how many blunts I smoked listening to this song!!","Bruh","You and me both! So many blunt cruises around town singing this song.","Be right back grabbing my hacky sack ","If you guys like Dispatch, check out State Radio, the singer's new band. ","Chad also has some great solo albums. His newest one, The Horse Comanche, is my favorite. Simerkane II is good too tho.","I saw him in Ames promoting that album. Played in a small college cafe. Maybe 30 of us in there. Sat 3 feet from them. One of my favorite shows.","All three of them were singers. The 3 part harmonies are what make them one of my favorite bands. But yeah State Radio is pretty good.","Chadwick Stokes is even more recent. He had an album last year","Chad stokes is such a cool guy.  His newest album \"the horse comanche\" is really good. If you like dispatch I'd recommend it (or anything else he's done in chandwick, SR , or dispatch) ","Right Me Up and Riddle In London Town are some of my favorites. ","I'm a big fan of Man in the Hall and Mountain.  MitH has a really good groove to it. ","If you like politically-driven songs, Camilo, Fight No More, Gunship, Gang of Thieves, people to people, and the state and I -- are all fantastic. Yes I had to list them all. There are so many other good ones, too.\n\nI learned about State Radio by loving Camilo the first time I heard it. The songs you mentioned were the very next ones I listened to.\n\nSaw them at the Hotel Congress in Tucson, AZ. Was awesome.","Bohemian Grove is my favorite.","I'd say I like Gunship Politico or Fall of The American Empire better, but Bohemian Grove is the song that got me into the band. ","Definitely the best song off that album, but I'd say *Us Against the Crown* was flawless start to finish.","State Radio is also now on an indefinite hiatus of sorts, sadly.","Ya, Mike gave it up to work in finance (motherfucker had an MBA or something, who knew?) and they said they'd continue with someone else on drums, but I'm pretty sure it's just kinda over.\n\nIt's a shame because they were damn good, not just \"the guy from Dispatch's other band.\"","I met these guys! Mike's gf was living at my house and they all hung out in my back yard. I had a drum set he messed around on. I am a huge Dispatch/State Radio fan. I also saw Dispatch at their reunion tour maybe 5 years ago in Boston. My favorite concert I havebeen to.","Chuck's out too, unfortunately. I have a really bad feeling we won't see anything from the SR we know and love ever again. it sucks. ","Damn. Well then there's no reason to release or tour under that name and not just Chad Stokes. Reunion tour (or show, more likely) will happen one day.\n","I just saw Chuck tweet today to Chad and Matt about a fan begging for a reunion. They rock so fucking hard I need to get that back in my life. I love chad solo too but its too soft sometimes\n","Which doesn't really mean much with these guys. Dispatch have played like 6 \"last shows\". ","Also if you want State Radio's folksy - ballad style equivalent to The General, listen to their song, *The Story of Benjamin Darling pt. 1*","Bruh\n\n\"Manny don't need no comforting / he don't ask for nobody to bring him up\"","Not new. State Radio has been around a long time. ","MMmmm, Black Cab Motorcade. Rushian. I caught State Radio a couple of times in Iowa City and they put on a kickass show.","[This was always my favorite Dispatch song.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vb9fnX9MzKQ)","Great song! The All Points Bulletin live version with Phil Keggy is wonderful.","*Yes*. So many good jams on that album. Wish I was into them when that concert was going on in Boston, woulda been a short drive away.","This just made my day seeing it on my feed.","I'm glad I was able to make someone's day :)","Thank you!

I've never seen this video before though, it's pretty awesome.","That album was decent but that song is by far the best one on there. I'd put it in my top 10 dispatch songs I think, and that's tough to do ","That whole album is my favorite song.","Was fortunate enough to see Chad do a living room set in front of about 25 people a few years ago. He played our wedding song and sang it to my wife. I got laid that night. Was a great experience. ","Does anyone else remember downloading Sublime songs on Napster and getting this song?","One of my favorite songs!","This is considered Indie Folk? ","I wasn't really sure what to call it but I had to put something. I don't think there's always a real need to label music by genres. Just enjoy what I enjoy.","I agree, I just always figured there was a specific name for the OAR, Dispatch, type music. I don't know what I would call it ","They're kind of jam bands, but \"jam band\" covers such a wide variety of music that I don't think it could be called its own genre anyway.","That lightbulb in that firehouse. Been on for over 100 years. I think it has a Webcam. ","This band has been my favorite 10+ years any cd I put in instantly puts me in a great mood. also state radio is amazing Chad is an extreemly talented person.","This was on the soundtrack of a game called 'Payback'. It was a top-down GTA-style game on the old Commodore Amigas.","I will never forget how to play this song. When I moved into my university housing and people noticed me playing guitar this song and \"Hey There Delilah\" where the most requested songs. ","The number of times I've had to play Hey There Delilah, Wonderwall and Good Riddance is way too much haha.","I left Good Riddance in High School. I was in jazz band first period so I'd carry around my guitar all day and I played Good Riddance and Crash Into Me what seems like every day","Usually now if I want to impress a girl while playing guitar I'll play John Mayer because at least he's fun to play to and girls go crazy over his stuff.","I tried impressing my gf by playing some Kaki King songs, she told me to stick with Andy Grammer lol","I don't know who either of those are. Worth checking out?","Andy Grammer is a pop singer that I think is pretty good and my gf is in love with\n\nKaki king is my favorite guitar player out there, check out her album Glow if you want hear some ridiculous acoustic guitar playing. ","It doesn't really sound like she's doing anything too crazy with the guitar. If you want insane acoustic guitar playing check out [Joscho Stephan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_jzSv7G6vQ)","That's pretty awesome. I'll throw one more at you, my favorite guitar player, Michael Kelsey:\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frwsaK14o5U)","I may be a bit biased since this is my favorite band, but go and listen to their stuff. Across their discography, there's something for just about everyone.","I could never get into this band. A lot of my friends loved them, but I never clicked with them. They seemed to be a pop variety of the 90s jam band scene. Which isn't a slight, but it just wasn't my thing. Hadn't thought about them in years.","This fight is not worth fighting.  ","Dispatch was the best live concert I've ever seen ","Man, these are good times. The teacher that ran my highschool's guitar club would keep an acoustic in his room and play this all the time. I used to skip classes and just jam with him. Such a cool song.","I remember listening to this one https://youtu.be/Hm1YkW2Mh2U over and over one summer. I hadn't really paid attention to the lyrics at first, I just knew it made me feel nostalgic and happy. One time singing along, it registered what I was saying. The Flying Horses holds such a special place in my heart and memories, and every time I visited as a kid I wanted to take a ring SO BAD but never had the nerve. Instead, winning the brass ring made me feel like I had my own for just a moment. Love love love this song.","Never heard of these guys, then a few years ago the Palladia channel on cable showed them at the NJ Redbull stadium and could not figure out how a band got THIS BIG and I know nothing about them. \n\nThe General made me a fan for life!  What is left of it anyway.","This album is wonderful","Man... these guys, and most of what they do. Spectacular.","I fucking love Dispatch. Got to see them at Red Rocks, Chad and Brad popped up right in the middle of the crowd and played Bats in the Belfry. Too cool.","Been pretty obsessed with Dispatch and State Radio lately. Fond memories of my mom singing along to this song on road trips","i can listen to any song on, \"gut the van\" the live songs are amazing\n","Steeples on Gut the Van when they start doing the acapella breakdown is the greatest thing ever.","[this was one of my favs](https://youtu.be/UuYd1uyJyqA)","Thought for sure this was going to be something else...","This is such a great song, gives me chills every time I hear \"section 17\"","the story behind it is really sad and it was the first time i learned how horrible west Africa and specifically Zimbabwe was ","Took months for me to learn the lyrics","Really? It is a pretty simple song and half of the words are basically spoken. If English is your second language, I apologize. ","My favorite song ever.","A year or so later the drummer Braddigan did a small show at my college. It was really good. I have the audio somewhere. ","I started listening to them around 2012. I had no idea that the music I've been listening to is 15-20 years old until just now after reading some of the comments in this thread. I guess that just goes to show how great their music is!","The Acoustic brilliance of this song is unreal.﻿","Oh hey! Glad to see these guys getting some love. I discovered then years back and had to hunt down a few their albums. Anybody know if they're still active?","Maaaan. I love this fucking song. A friend of mine who used to share awesome new bands with me (Saosin, Avenged Sevenfold, Chiodos, Copeland, Acceptance, Desaparecidos) sent this song to me one day, and I was fucking blown away.","Hell yes! Love dispatch ","About 14 years ago, a girl I went to high school with told me to listen to \"Two coins\" and now she's my wife of 5 years.  So thanks for that Dispatch.  ","Saw them at the Wetlands in NYC in 2000 play to a few hundred people having never heard them before. This song, and a few others, stuck with me on the drive home. Saw them a bunch in 2000-2001, just an amazing live band.","Just pulled my guitar out for the first time in months and started by playing this song first.  Such a great one.\n","This is one of my all time favorites. Brings back memories of watching a father-son duo jamming out in their garage. ","You can almost create a calendar based on how frequently someone posts this song in this subreddit.","I first heard this from a World of Warcraft PVP video, a rogue with a Thunderfury named Caen from Bloodsworn (before they were Overrated) on Shadow Moon server. \n\nDamn I got to listen and like a few good songs from WoW PVP videos now that I think about it.","This song is so nostalgic for me. My older brother was into Dispatch, and played this all the time. I was obsessed with the guitar intro. ","One of my favorite songs by one of my favorite bands of all time. This one takes me back.","One of my absolute favorites","Any dudes wanna go hack some sack on the quad? I'll be the guy wearing the dmb '96 tour shirt","Thank you for saying that. It is one of my more cherished memories.  ","I've been jammin to this song for like 7 years. My brother blew my mind when he told me state radio was the same guy from dispatch.","I worked for these guys for a summer before they blew up. A buddy and I ran their merch table. We traveled with them to shows at prep schools, colleges, and small clubs from New England down to New York. Spent a lot of time with them in random places. All very good guys. Nice, down to earth, and at the time understood how lucky they were. This was in 99-00, and is a time that was fucking awesome. ","Can confirm every college bro from 2002 - 2007 knew this song.\n","Love this song","you lucky bastard\n\none of the most historic concerts of all time\n","Best concert I've ever seen","That was crazy. That many people crowded in there.  Busy and I drove nonstop from Illinois to see them, alternating sleeping.\n\nWhat's crazier is pricing for booze down there. $11 for a Jagerbomb.","Pete's not the guitarist.  He plays bass on most songs, including this one.","Actually, it's completely dependent on the song. On the recordings, he most likely plays both, or it can be one or the other depending on which member wrote the song. As for live, they all switch around, again depending on who wrote the song. \n\nPete and Chad are pretty equal as far as guitar goes.The only semi-permanent position in this band is Brad on percussion, and you'd be surprised how many songs he's actually the one playing guitar. \n\nAs for the story I was referring to, I can almost guarantee he was talking about Pete because he is a chain smoker. Plus, I don't think either of the other band members smoke. ","oh elias.... elias, elias","All I remember was that it was camp beber in Wisconsin. And I'm from Maryland so I thought there was a chance it was the same camp","Same here. Freshman year of college way back in 2002. Virginia Tech. ","At what camp were you a counsellor, if you don't mind me asking?","YMCA Rotary Camp Presqu'ile near Owen Sound","Ah ok, then you weren't my counsellor","Went to camp in GA/NC.

A bit of a slower place cause the guys are all still involved in their slower stuff","I got to see them at vibes two years ago and it was magical","Seen them 3 times now. Best one by far has been MSG this past summer. Totally incredible","Was there for that... Amazing show.. Saw them there and at fire fly ","So crazy how it takes bands breaking up to figure out the whole \"one album as a band, then one solo album\" balance","I saw them in New Jersey like 5-6 years ago and they killed it. ","Red Bull Arena? That's another one I was at! First time seeing them, unreal encore especially with the zip line ","That was it!  I was going to say red bull arena, but I wasn't sure if I had the name right. They zip line thing was amazing!","They did a show in 2009 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. as well. All-acoustic set at a time when they had been \"broken up\" since Zimbabwe (and before). That was the only time I saw them, but it was an incredible experience. We had about 30 people outside for a jam beforehand, and they came out and signed autographs and jammed with us for a while. One of the coolest things I've been a part of.","They have been doing gigs and tours intermittently for the last decade or so. ","Same for me. Freshman year 2002. ","Recent college grad here..... Please describe this era of college bro. Sounds strange and interesting. ","Imagine the bro you know and now imagine him listening to this song.\n\n\nHonestly though, I was pretty happy when my childhood friends that went the bro route started listening to good music in college.","It's just, I think if the bros I know played this track the keystone light cans in their hands would spontaneously rupture and their Vineyard vine hats would fly off. ","haha. We still drank keystone light, but just played this and crazy game of poker. \n\n\n","Not so sure though. The general was written before 2003.\n\nEDIT:\n\nnevermind...chose to look up the song:\n\nIn The Best of Dispatch, a book containing guitar and voice transcriptions of selected Dispatch songs, Chad Urmston describes \"The General\":\n\n“\tThis was our anti-war song. Although it was primarily based on the Civil War, the message was not confined to that particular conflict. The song tells about General Robert E. Lee telling his Confederate army to basically go home and stop fighting. We were too young to be directly involved in the Gulf War; nevertheless, the sense of a troubled history rings loud in the heads of young men who grow up listening to grandfathers or fathers recount war stories. The crowd response to this song always blew us away. Some said it had a \"Castles Made of Sand\" feel - any reference to Hendrix we took gladly.\nWe recorded the song up in the northeast kingdom on borrowed instruments. Our hazy-eyed hairball engineer swayed like a derelict wrecking ball over the console like a played-out carnie with nothing to show for a lifetime of swindling. His down-to-the-filter cigarette wandered listlessly with a skeletal droop of ash as he leaned on his crippled office chair teasing gravity. He ended up giving in to his heavy eyes and passing out on the couch with his feet up, still holding the cigarette as Brad and I took turns pressing the \"record\" and \"locate\" buttons.[3]","Dripping in goat juice","See, I always found them to be quite awesome.  Good entertainers, songs that very much tell stories. And their songs are such a variety of sounds that listening to an album doesn't get old sounding by the last song.","steeples is amazing, their live versions are some much better than their studio songs","Awesome Song to play on guitar, such great energy","The lead singer, Braddigan, came to the navy base I lived on in Japan for a small free show about a decade ago now. My friends and I somehow were able to play a few songs to open for him, and daaaaamn, we were so bad haha. Always brings back good memories whenever I hear Dispatch though.","Brad is drummer, but does some vocals as well. He is a awesome guy though.","fuck this shit song","I would definitely consider this ska not indie folk rock. I like it all the same.","Take a shower/shine your shoes/you've got no time to lose. ~ Seriously, who still shines their shoes? Because of this song I do. ","Military. They shine their shoes that are part of their uniform all the time. ","The lyrics drive me crazy\n\n\"But not a man moved. Their eyes gazed straight ahead, till one-by-one they stepped back and not a word was said.\"\n\nSo a man moved! Immediately after you say not a man moved every single man left wtf man get it together\n\nEdit: People cannot handle a minor critique to a song they like","The word \"till\" makes it acceptable","They were given a pass. The General, in his dream, saw the other soldiers and saw that they had mothers; they were no different than his men. \"This fight is not worth fighting.\" The General knew that both sides would take great loss, and for what? Land? Money? Whatever it was, it wasn't worth dying for. So he took the heat, and will pay the ultimate price so that these young men could live another day and hopefully fight a fight worth fighting one day.","From my home town!","Not enough people know about this band - my favourite ever!","Classic","Fucking hate this song.","http://i.imgur.com/AB7XhUe.jpg","Cool, thanks for letting us know","I never thought I'd have to hear this fucking awful song ever again, yet here we are.

Back in spring 2012 these guys were filming a music video for \"Not Messin'\" in Rhode Island, where I was living at the time. They needed ~200 fans to help them filled it and I thought \"why the hell not?\" and went.

Maybe not for that alone but you have the shipping as stated and if you ship, don't remember exactly, around 20 items then it's payed for in total. As well, you have the spotify type service that works well and has a decent selection. Then you also have the photo backup. Personally, I would get rid of Netflix and Spotify before Prime.

","Sure lesson learnt, but there are some lessons that you can learn without being stupid af.\n\nDo you really need to drive over the speed limit, get into an accident, possibly get injuries, to know that speeding can cause accidents?\n\nNo.\n\nSomething more nuanced like not exercising your employee rights properly and then overworking/getting paid less or something like that can be a lesson learn from experience. But strictly stupid things are stupid.","In some cases, you probably do need to get into an accident before realizing that you shouldn't speed.  Sure, people know that speeding could cause an accident.  However, there is a massive difference between \"some people get in accidents when they speed\" and \"if I speed, there's a good chance that I will get in an accident\".  It's easy to rationalize things away with \"others could, but I'm better/smarter/faster/etc so it won't happen to me\".\n\nAlso, you have to ask the right question before you can find the obvious answer.  Say there's a pot of boiling water on the stove.  Someone goes to pick it up without pot holders and burns themself.  Is that a stupid mistake?  Yes.  Of course the pot is hot, its been on the stove for the last 20 minutes.  And of course hot things can burn you.  Is that a mistake that a smart person shouldn't have made?  Eh.\n\nIn day to day life (assuming you don't spend much time in the kitchen), you can generally pick up just about everything without worrying about heat.  In that case, you probably assume that temperature isn't an issue without every consciously thinking about it.  Now, you are dealing with a new experience (cooking on a stove), and that assumption is no longer valid.  However, the whole point of an assumption is that you aren't consciously thinking about it.  Therefore, you continue to assume subconsciously that heat isn't an issue and you burn yourself on a hot stove.  It is extraordinarily stupid, but it is a perfectly understandable mistake to make (once, at least).","&gt; Do you really need to drive over the speed limit, get into an accident, possibly get injuries, to know that speeding can cause accidents?\n\nyeah... even though I agree with you, I just read that you don't own a car so... maybe you should choose another example until then... I mean, I don't think the majority of people who get into an accident suddenly woke up one day and decided \"you know what? speed limits are overrated, let's not give a fuck about that anymore\".

Still saying it's a bad bad idea, but my point is it's not an idea, there is no decision process involved here...

WTF. Just because I don't own a car doesn't mean I haven't been in one. It doesn't mean I don't know the common knowledge involved with cars and it sure has hell has no effect on my example. That was the point there. That I don't need to be in an accident, or hell, even own a car, to know speeding is dangerous.\n\n&gt; I mean, I don't think the majority of people who get into an accident suddenly woke up one day and decided \"you know what? speed limits are overrated, let's not give a fuck about that anymore\"\n\nYou seem to be totally misunderstanding what I said. The point was: A lesson can be learned without making a mistake. The car example was one.

There is no lesson to be learned here. Even a driver, who HASN'T been in a speeding accident, knows that he is mistaking a mistake by speeding. \n\nIn conclusion, some lessons don't require mistakes to be made to be learned. Those are called common sense. And I am arguing that this $600 was not a simple mistake necessary to be made to learn that spending someone else's money IRRESPONSIBLY has repercussions. ","&gt;wait wait wait. WTF.

Something like \"buying another microtransaction is like driving over the limit by a couple mph, it seems harmless and the more you do it the more it seems like you can get away with it, until you fuck up big time\"  \n","Are you really trying to argue that going 1 mile an hour over the speed limit is always a mistake?  Going too fast is clearly a mistake.  \"Too fast\" doesn't necessarily have a close connection to the speed limit.  There are a lot of places where the speed limit is X and I know damn well that it is completely safe (in good conditions, at least) to do X+Y.  If it is raining/snowing/dark/whatever, sure, I will slow down (possibly to below the speed limit, depending on the conditions).  That doesn't mean that going over the speed limit is always unsafe.\n\nFor that matter, there are also a lot of situations where going 10 over the speed limit is safer than going 5 under the speed limit -- if everyone around you is going at a given speed, matching them will be safer than praying that the guy behind you notices you and doesn't rear end you.\n\nI guess this might be culture dependent to an extent.  In the US (or at least the mid atlantic/northeast), people tend to assume that the enforced speed limit is actually 10mph higher than the listed limit, and I think that listed limits are often lowered to counteract that.  Is that a pretty stupid system?  Yes.  Fixing it is somewhat harder, though.","Difference being I had the foresight to never HAVE to learn from my mistakes. \"oops lol sorry bro guess you're out 600 dollars\" isn't justified because you \"learn you lesson\" afterwards.","What's it like to be born with perfect foresight?

It's dumb to assume that this was as malicious as everyone is making it seem.

They were purchased to be used on two sports games only the 14 year old plays.\n\nThis is pretty clearly not a phishing practice. Phishing generally would be someone spending all that money on ps4 gift cards and then reselling it to others.\n\nIt's almost 100% certain that the 14-year-old is guilty, and that he knew exactly what he was doing. Almost every microtransaction requires a verification process for the purchases to be made on the card. I do agree with /u/This_Vicious_Cabaret in that microtransaction opportunities can be difficult for younger children to understand, like 8-10 year olds who are still fuzzy with real world transactions, let alone video game ones. But a 14 year old? Unless he's got a serious learning disability, at this age he definitely knew what he was doing. I was very very clear at that age what required real money and what did not.","I think you're right in that he likely knew he was spending real money and that it was wrong, but I can see the point that it could have been the *scale* that escaped him. I've seen it in kids and even young adults before who are new to managing finances. Put some money on the card, give it a week...hey, nobody said anything. I got away with it. And now it's out of their mind; it's like it never happened, and they go ahead and do it again. It's not until the bill comes due that they realize how much they spent.\n\nApparently these charges were over the span of a couple months. It's not like he sat down and burned $600 in one night. He probably spent $20 here, $40 there, never kept track of how much it was or took the time to add it up, and then OH SHIT dad and bro are PISSED because it's...$600? Holy crap did I really spend that much? Nah...nah, couldn't have. *Deny deny deny*. Same thing happens to many adults when they get their first credit card bill and realize that all those little this-and-that purchases add up to a bunch of money *that they still have to come up with*. I don't have any difficulty at all imagining a 14 year old falling into that kind of trap.","I'm not a parent, but I would probably have a talk with my 14 year old kid and let them know that there isn't going to be punishment.  Kids are allowed to make mistakes.\n\nThen, for the next month or two, the family as a whole pays off the debt.  Allowances, if there are any, are reduced.  family meals are cheapened, lots of rice/beans/etc.  Things like soda/juice not purchased and replaced with water.  Instead of taking 2 cars to get around, one car is garaged and the family carpools in the morning to get to work/school, and car pools to get home.  The whole goal behind this is not to show that if you get caught you get punished, but regardless of what happened or who is to blame, the family unit has to deal with the consequences.","14 year olds do not have a lot of empathy yet.  All you will be doing is making the entire family (including yourself) miserable and the 14 year old *will not care*.","You're right. Remove one of their fingers. Use your teeth and look them in the eye as you do it.","There needs to be punishment. The 14 year old did something wrong  (spent money not his) and should have to pay it back. Besides that, he lied about spending the money, which is possibly a bigger transgression.","And to show just how much that kind of money is. ","&gt;It is very likely that someone was a victim or phishing, rather than deliberately or accidentally spending money.\n\nIn which case, you're screwed, because Sony doesn't give a fuck. They won't reimburse your account even if it's hacked, which happened to thousands of users a year or two ago.","Can only speak for myself, but my PSN was hacked a few years ago and I had my credit card charged for £60 for some kind of trading card stuff for a FIFA game, which I didn't even own. Contacted Sony as soon as I noticed (within a few days) and they asked for the console's ID.\n\nTook about a month or two more, but I got all the money back as a full refund. The only problem with such issues is that if you contact the bank about it and they perform a chargeback, some companies will ban your whole damn account, which sucks.","Fair point, but they pretty much stonewalled everyone who had their account compromised last year. A lot of people did ultimately issue chargebacks and were banned, so they just told Sony to fuck themselves and left the Playstation community altogether. ","Why would somebody breach an account's security and then give away the breach by purchasing 600$ worth of content using that account and download them on someone else's machine??\n\nFurther why would they fake the IP so that Sony saw the purchases coming from their home?","Can you quantify \"very real chance\" after the OP says that was already discussed with Sony?","No you take away their hours.","\"I can't believe you think I'm that kind of person\" is the kind of line someone uses when they're used to getting out of trouble by crying and acting hurt.  It's almost always an adulterer's first defense as well.","No doubt it's sometimes used to obfuscate by liars but there is nothing like the pain caused by people you love, respect and trust accusing you of something you did *not* do. I've used those words with absolute honesty in the past.","its not only a learning experience for the 14 yo but the brother as well. secure your accounts especially if they have banking info attached","Reading posts like this one is like having someone sit down and spell out specifically how my parents fucked up and could have not fucked up.","This would be a great recommendation for a 8-10 year old.  A 14-year old?  Your ass is gonna mow lawns until you can pay back that $600.","Which is covered in the \"here's how I will make it up to you\" portion of the apology.","Which is seriously dwarfed by the paragraphs explaining how a 14-year old doesn't know right from wrong or how money works.  Shit, a 14-year old probably has a better grasp of how the PlayStation and credit cards work than the parent does.","Have you played those games? They make millions off those IAPs. They're deliberately designed to be as easy to buy as possible. I have no trouble believing a 14 year old could buy one without really knowing what they were doing. $600 worth? Less so. But the point still stands. ","14 year olds aren't stupid.  They just think they'll get away with stuff because they don't have experience dealing with problems yet.  He knows what he was doing, and was unaware he was going to face consequences.","This is simply ignorant. You cant generalize all 14 year olds. I certainly did not have a good grasp on either when i was at this age.","Seriously what disturbs me is how the comment linked to here doesn't treat \"paying back the money\" or \"making sure the 17YO gets his money back\" as priority number one \n\n\n*His brother needs to give your son a way to make amends, and your job is to make sure it's fair. Ideally, it should be something constructive (like a repayment plan or some other, less direct restitution)*\n\n\nRepaying the money is not optional, or \"one of the options\", it's critical, the 14YO stole from the 17YO, if the 14YO is not able to be responsible for this the parents need to step in and make up the difference. I'd damn well expect the parents to empty the 14YOs bank account and sell all his posessions to make up that $600. Even if the parents pay for some of it they need to make sure the 14YO is the one who suffers, \"no sorry we can't pay for your guitar lessons because we gave you the money your brother stole\" is just as bad as leaving the 17Yo without the money.\n\n\nAnyone who thinks this family unit is going to function if the money is not paid back is divorced from reality, if the younger brother is allowed to get away with this without paying back the money then the family is done for. What does it teach the 17YO? Crimes have o punishment? THat he cannot trust anyone or rely on rules and property rights to prevail? It wouldn't suprise me if he starts padlocking his bedroom. This money was hard earned, he did hard dirty work for. If I was that 17YO everytime I saw them spend money on somemthing like ice cream for the family I'd be seeing that as my money, apparently there's money to spend on my little brother who stole $600 from me but not money to give me back some of that $600.","Given the information the OP provided, it seems that the 14 year old used the brother's card for his video games. We can discuss intent all we want, but in the end, the younger brother (possibly by accident) ended up costing his brother $600. \n\nPersonally, I think this is a great time to teach the 14 year old and the 17 year old a few lessons. In the real world if you cause someone harm, even without any mal intent, you still need to pay. Just today I saw someone unloading their van, and they hit the car next to them, causing a slight dent. The person who did the damage did not do so intentionally, and wasn't even particularly reckless, he just made a bad move and now needs to pay. Similarly, I will assume the 14 year old was not being malicious, or even understood the impact of his actions, but guess what, he caused harm and should pay up. He is old enough to get a part time job (a few hours each weekend) doing dishes, working for McDonalds, bussing tables, etc. to pay off the debt.\n\nAs for trust, the father needs to present the evidence and ask the 14 year old one more time if he did it. If he refuses to admit fault, he loses privileges to use the PS4. If not he has full right to use it, but under a separate account. The PS4 is a privilege, and if the 14 year old cannot even admit to his wrong doing, he loses the privilege. Being an adult is owning up to your wrong doings.\n\nAs for the 17 year old, you need to teach him the ability to accept apologies, and forgive wrong doings if the 14 year old works to pay him back. It also is a good time to teach him to review his account information to ensure false charges do not go through.","u/This_Vicious_Cabaret gives the kind of weak parenting advice that makes for the kids that steal your car stereos. 14 year olds already had a chance to learn about honesty. My kids will be learning about punishment if they steal at 14, like they should.","Oh yeah. He knows he was wrong. It is why he is lying. ","Except most of what he wrote is dead wrong. Coddling a teenager who's straight up lying is not smart. He 1,000% knows he was spending real money, and it was 1,000% on micro transactions. ","[removed]","What are you talking about with your first point? I've had a bank account and a debit card since I was 15 when I started working part time. Similar with my sister and all my friends. A 17 year old is basically an adult, they need to be able to manage those type of things.","17 - you don't need a debit card\n\n18 - vote for government office and begin military duty","[removed]","Immediate counterpoint, I've had a debit card since 12 (nationwide FlexOne) that my pocket money got put into and that taught me SO much about managing money. This scenario probably wouldn't have happened if they were in charge of their own money and understood the concepts better.","I'm not saying they shouldn't have a bank account or money of their own. I'm saying that they need to be taught to manage it better. First of all tying a debit card to an online game platform is just a terrible idea because it's virtually impossible to dispute charges. Second it's clear they aren't managing it well because it took 2 months to notice $20 transactions every other day.\n\nThose two facts alone make it clear that they need help managing their account.","At 16 I got a job, and a debit card that I could use as I pleased. 17 is not too young for a debit card, if the person is working, they earned that money.","Ima just wade into the sea of your downvotes and tell you that I agree with you.\n\nI got my first  job at 17, and my first checking account to match. I used a debit card, mostly responsibly, but there were definitely a few times when I ran out of money and nearly overdrew. It didn't feel like spending money, it felt like swiping plastic. Then within a few years my card was used illegally (not by me) and about $1k was gone. There was literally NO recourse; my hard-earned money was just gone.\n\nI wish my stupid seventeen-year-old self was cognizant of the dangers of a debit card. I would have stuck strictly with cash had I known.\n\nAlso, keeping a close eye on your finances is a necessity, because, as you say, in the real world, mom and dad can't just make a thief pay you back.","1) You're paranoid - 12 year olds can and, in my opinion, should get debit cards. Fucking up when you're 13 and losing £30 is better than fucking up when you're 20 and losing £3000\n\n2) How do you even check your account *weekly*. I get statements in quarterly (I assume that OP did too - hence the 2 month gap) and check online when I need to make a payment for rent or bills. Why would someone do so more than weekly? Just to check? Monday: No fraud. Wednesday: Nope. Friday: Still nothing...\n\n3) The bank won't care, but small claims court will (if they're both adults). You can't just steal $600 from someone in the real world, even if you're their brother. They need to be taught that this is seriously not OK and that the actions would have serious, serious consequences in the future.","&gt; 12 year olds can and, in my opinion, should get debit cards. Fucking up when you're 13 and losing £30 is better than fucking up when you're 20 and losing £3000\n\nAnd this kid was 17, lost much more than \"£30\", and daddy is having to sort out the mess for him. No where do I see where this means that this kid can manage a debit card appropriately. Some kids can, yes, but clearly this one can't.\n\n&gt;How do you even check your account weekly\n\nMy budgeting app automatically pulls in my bank account transactions as soon as they clear (typically about 3 days). Before then I just didn't check it that often (maybe once a month?) because I just never used a debit card. For my credit card, I'd just look through my statement quickly about once a week and see if there was anything that I didn't pay for and dispute it if needed. I've had to do this maybe 3x in my adult life. The disputes are usually resolved within the month and I don't have to pay for it. It took ~5 minutes a week. With my current budgeting app, it's automatic and I don't really have to do anything.\n\n&gt;The bank won't care, but small claims court will (if they're both adults).\n\nGood luck with that when (as has happened to one friend of mine) your debit card is skimmed from a machine and you are out over $1k and you don't even know who did it. And even if you knew the person, do you really think it's easy to just go to court to get it back? It's a serious cost in time and some money. Why not avoid it in the first place?\n\nSeriously, if you are using debit cards for everyday transactions, you are putting yourself at completely  unnecessary risk. [I'm far from the only person who thinks this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbarro/2012/04/03/why-you-should-never-use-debit-cards/#2858e3b5eb6b). [More good reason not to use a debit card](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/01/14/why-you-should-never-use-your-debit-card.aspx)","The issue with this is that a 17 year old is much better off with a debit card than a credit card, they can only spend money they have. You are saying its this kid's fault his brother is a shit head, and it's not. I had my purse stolen and they used my debit card to buy some things, I called the bank and the money was back within days.","&gt;You are saying its this kid's fault his brother is a shit head\n\nWhere did I say this? I specifically said it wasn't (and his brother definitely should be punished in some way). I'm saying that his financial management skills are shit and that clearly needs guidance because he didn't notice for *2 months* and he's using a debit card for everyday expenses. He has zero recourse to ever get his money back because of both those things. In the real world that could have easily been his entire checking account and now he can't pay rent and he gets evicted.\n\nHere, let me put it this way: Imagine if I leave $600 in an envelope on my front porch and don't check on it for months on end and it ends up missing. Yeah, it's not my fault that it's stolen, but I also shouldn't have been as careless with it.\n\nIf this were with a credit card, that would be one thing. You have much better legal protections with those. There's a reason why most financial advisers tell you never to use debit.","Just to offer a different perspective, I check my credit card and bank balances online (on mobile) every few days. I keep a budget, as well as a ledger of everything I spend, so I keep close track on my spending, keep receipts, watch balances, etc etc.\n\nSo it's definitely possible to be vigilant about your finances.

","I'm American and where I am we say both. Given my experience, not very many people know there are other queens. There is the Queen of England and that is it. It wasn't until my last year of high school some of us learned that Spain had royalty too. So when people say \"He/she went to go visit the Queen\" or \"The Queen is coming\" they either mean Beyonce or the Queen of England.","Alternatively if they say \"Queen is coming\" then Freddie Mercury is apparently back from the dead.","FYI she's not the Queen of England; that's not been a title since 1707.\n\n&gt;[Anne became Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland on 8 March 1702. On 1 May 1707, under the Acts of Union, two of her realms, the kingdoms of England and Scotland, united as a single sovereign state known as Great Britain. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain)","Here's a question for you then. Is she  still the Queen of England, in the same way that Canada happens to have the same Queen as we do? Is it legitimate to call her the Queen of, say, London, or Berkshire, or wherever? Because it seems to me that 'Queen Of England' is a subset of 'Queen of Great Britain' \n\nGenuinely asking here, if you happen to know. ","No, because the Acts of Union 1706/7 dissolved the kingdoms of Scotland and England and replaced it with a single Kingdom of Great Britain. Canada is a separate kingdom. The current kingdom is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Queen of England is always wrong, because there is no kingdom to be queen of.\n\nEqually, Queen of Great Britain has been wrong since 1801.","So there is no such thing as Scotland or England? ","Yes, but they're not kingdoms. Have you never played CK2?","So there is an England, and it is part of Great Britain? Wouldn't the Queen of the kingdom be the reigning monarch of all descending territories in that kingdom? ","I think that they are trying to say that while yes she is queen over the territory of England, amongst other places, \"Queen of England\" is not her correct title. It would be like calling Obama \"President of Texas\". Correct from a certain point of view, but not the done thing.\n\nMind you, if you want to be properly correct you have to say \"Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\".","It's like saying Obama is the President of New York. New York is not a country to be president of, it's a state. Yes the USA includes New York but that's not the same thing.","I'm American and I very rarely here \"the Queen of England.\" Most of the time it's just \"Queen Elizabeth\" or \"the Queen\" if the topic is already established. As for the rest of the royal family, I've noticed a divide in males and females. I feel like most men just say \"William\" or \"Kate\" whereas the girls I know always say \"Prince William.\"","Queen of England isn't even an existing title so they must clearly be referring to some long dead monarch of at least 300 and potentially 400 years ago so it's good that they don't say that","Right, but very few Americans know that. To them (us), she is \"the Queen of England.\" I don't know why that mistake is the default here. And agreeing with many others: I think it's fair to say that for most Americans, if you say \"the Queen,\" they automatically think of Elizabeth. \n\nEdit: bad grammar","\"Prince Charles\" is pretty ubiquitous, though. ","We even gave him his own comic here with his twin brother Gallant! ","We (Americans) will often call the Queen \"the Queen\". See? I just did it. Yes, we also might say \"the Queen of England\". The distinction between Britain and England seems to be lost on a lot of people here.\n  \nI'm in Massachusetts, for the record. ","American in Oklahoma here.\n\nI don't know anyone who specifies \"of England.\" Everyone just calls her \"The Queen.\"","To be fair, there's no Queen of the Commonwealth. She's the head of the Commonwealth, sure. But each Commonwealth Realm is a separate Kingdom that just happen to be in a personal union. So she's the Queen of the United Kingdom and also the Queen of Australia and Queen of Jamaica and Queen of Belize etc.\n\nBut OMG Queen of England is one thing that still tickles my inner pedant.

For Republicans, if any candidate ( Trump this time is more likely) gets 1237 delegates in the primaries, it will be extremely difficult and 'unseemly' ( though not technically impossible, as far as I know) to deny him the nomination.","On the Republican side though, you have a huge disconnect between the Republican party leaders and the voters of said party. Trump is overwhelming popular with Republicans yet the party leaders hate him because he would be such an unknown. They aren't a fan of Ted Cruz either because he is massively anti-Establishment. \n\nThey are now doing everything they can to stop Trump reaching 1237 delegates so that he doesn't win the first round of voting at the convention, hence co tested convention, free vote for all delegates and they can pick someone else. Rumours are, since Cruz and Trump are unpopular in the party, they will pick Kaisch or the party will enter an extra candidate purely at the convention. \n\nSo basically, Trump and Cruz, jointly with overwhelming majority of the votes now it's a three horse race could both NOT be the nomination in favour of someone who dropped out months ago like Jeb Bush or Kaisch who has barely any votes in comparison. And the Republican Party desperately wants it. May be within the rules of the convention, but that is MASSIVE voter disenfranchisement ","Yes ,  I agree. But as much as I hate the RNC Establishment ( I am a Rand Paul supporter ), it is not really a case of voter disenfranchisement, is it?  It is often said that RNC and DNC are private bodies, and the public will definitely be able to vote in the general elections.","But if a huge majority of Republican voters say effectively say \"We want Trump\" and \"We want Cruz\", then the party says back \" We heard you, but here, vote for Jeb Bush, even though you didn't vote for him earlier and he dropped out as a result\". That's the definition of voter disenfranchisement  ","See, I agree with you in spirit. What I'm trying to say is, if the people can convince Trump/Cruz to run 3rd party ( if they are 'seized' of the nomination), then the people can vote for Trump/Cruz. Else vote for RNC/DNC/Libertarian/GreenParty/Write-in-someone. I agree that the contested convention will seem evil, maybe it is indeed evil (heck, I hate it) , but it is legal and unfortunately, right ( from the perspective of RNC's rights).","America and third parties doesnt really work because of the way the media, election system and funding works. Ok, this would be slightly different as they have had a lot of publicity during the primaries but still, it would be unlikely.\n\nAnyway, the issue is voter disenfranchisement. It's impossible to argue that effectively overruling the voters in NOT disenfranchisement as it is the definition of it. Legality of what they are doing is besides the issue. Its a moral issue, not a legal one\n","oh, BINGO!, my family think I'm a tin-hatter for muttering about Governments being mere mouthpieces for Big Money, but I know it's true.

A country that not only takes billions in aid from the US but also hasn't actually done anything close to what Europe has done for the US in its entire existence. All major politicians and all major demographics in the US speak consistent on this issue with the exception of a very small minority so it's not just Trump.\n\nWhen the US tells us to fuck off, when they say Britain or Europe is weak and contributes nothing.

They'll triumphantly announce how weak they think Europe is and how Europe is constantly stabbing America in the back whilst soldiers are dying on the battlefields and billions are being spent ....right as they speak on their podiums, then they lap up Israel whilst Israel takes billions from them and contributes nothing.","&gt; A country that not only takes billions in aid from the US\n\nUS spends $3b a year defending Israel.

It's strange that the small amount of aid to Israel receives such disproportionate attention, would it be better for the US to let the only liberal country in the middle east get invaded and destroyed?","Like I said, the mentality in the US is that Europe does nothing for them. Despite spending billions on wars and (I know nobody cares but) actual lives lost too. Yet the American media, government and populace constantly likes to pretend that Europe never does anything for America and that Israel is the only true great ally. \n\nSo how many more dead soldiers and stupid wars and terror attacks does a country even need if it's still just going to be considered a worthless ally. The US offers nothing. Europe doesn't need to pretend to hate Russia so it has to pretend to need 200bn of US military aid so that the US can pretend to say Europe does nothing. \n\nAll whilst Americans talk about how worthless the world is despite the fact that so many non-Americans die fighting stupid American wars but the only country that doesn't do that, is the country that is considered the best ally.","I don't know where you're getting that the average American thinks of Israel as this great ally. To be perfectly honest he average American probably doesn't think of Israel much at all. As the other commenter said, most Americans would consider Europe to be Americas greatest allies, especially because huge portions of America have ancestry all over Europe. ","Realistically,  Americans per se don't care about Israel nearly as much as you'd think from watching the media here.  Politicians give it way more time than it deserves soley because every politician that spends money on Israel gets a chunk of it back in political donations.  To vote against anything Israel is to vote against yourself at the next election so most politicians are afraid to do it.\n\nJust one more way how unlimited campaign funds causes democratic elections to break down.","Maybe if we didn't have to keep breaking up Europe's little \"world\" wars we would respect them more.

There's a principality and a number of dukedoms, but no sub-kingdoms.","I never said that it was the case, just that it would be possible. The person I replied to didn't seem to understand this.","I imagine there was a pretty heavy opinion penalty when they destroyed two kingdoms at once. But I guess it's probably gone after 300 years.","You'd think that, but the Scottish independence vote recently suggests otherwise :)","You need an armed insurrection in that country","They are historical nations, not nation-states in the legal sense. Legally, they function more like provinces or states.\n\nSo yes, she's the Queen of England in the same way that she is the Queen of Quebec. \n\nBut neither of those is an official title.\n\n","There's no such thing as the *kingdoms* of Scotland and England. They are still political entities.  ","Yea. I know. I was being pedantic and trying to say while they are not kingdoms, they are part of the kingdom she is monarch of, so her reign would extend to them. Like someone else said, you wouldn't say Obama is president of Texas, but since Texas is part of the US and there is no other president of Texas it is technically true. Same with the Queen. She is the queen of England, but only because England is a defined entity inside the Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. ","But it's not technically true. It's technically *not true*, since there is no defined office of President of Texas. The same way the President of the EU wouldn't be the President of the UK just because the latter is a member of the former. Offices do not 'extend' or filter down to other official positions, especially when they're not even defined. The dean of a university isn't 'Dean of Mathematics' by extension; not technically, officially, nominally, symbolically, or even practically. ","Our commander in chief is all over that shit right now, period.  Amrite?","Not as independent kingdoms.","Interesting, thanks for the answer. ","Yeah but we call our PM \"The Prime Minister\". Not much different when you think about it.","Meh.  It's what's understood I imagine.  Other countries have Presidents but yours doesn't and, beyond just habit,  the others just don't have the status of the Pres of the USA.  I doubt anyone was confused.\n\nAnyway, I believe the proper title for Mugabe, is \"The Dishonorable Right Cunt, Mugabe\"","Well you are preparing to leave one Union why not join another .","osama bin bama","Well, even world wide, soon as you say \"The President\" you automatically think of Obama (or at least the US president).  The only other president that might enter your mind is Putin.  I don't see it as an issue personally.","Er, no.  Though I suspect that's exactly what they're promoting.","Who do you think of when you hear the word President?\n\n","Shevardnadze and Micheal Heseltine.","How old are you?  I suspect that would be why you don't associate it.  I don't know who them two people are, google to rescue.  Georgian president... yea nope.  Irrelevant country with no political power or world stage at all.  And a British MP? Why was he called President... I wasn't alive during Thatchers reign.","Old enough to have paid a damn sight more licence fees than you³.   Your ignorance, despite the zeitgeist and BBC3, doesn't make you right.\n\nGet off my lawn.\n\n³  This gives me more say.  Obviously.\n\n(Heseltine was President of the Board of Trade and made the BBC call him President.  It was ludicrous at the time, such that the title is meaningless now.)","I'd expect so, I've only paid for about 3 years worth of licenses XD.\n\nThey called him President, the The President.  There is a difference to me.  Eitherway, the association of words changes depending on the time or context.\n\nAt the moment if you say The President anyone under the age of 50 (although I expect quite a lot of people over 50 would still) will associated The President with who ever is US president at the time.\n\nI've already tested the 20 people I work with in my team, and I just spoke naturally, using \"The President\" and all of them assumed I was talking about Obama.  Only two are over 50 though.","I'm curious, given the BBC is paid for by us, do you think that's a good thing?","I don't really see any issue with it.  I mean there are only two power presidents in the world, Putin and Obama.  Every other President is pretty irrelevant on a world stage, at least enough for us to care about, and out of Putin/Obama, Obama is by far the more powerful.  So natural assumption is he's the defacto \"President\".\n\nIs that correct, probably not, but doesn't it cause confusion? Nope, not unless your over 40 at least, in which case your on your way out anyway XD.","This is what I said would happen if they didn't drown Nick Grimshaw.
