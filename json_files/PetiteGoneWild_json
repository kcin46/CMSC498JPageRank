I'll have to revisit it and see if I can watch it in the correct order.","Out of order all the characters seem bipolar. They're friends one episode and hate each other the next. ","Man, that is too bad.  I REALLY liked him in it.  ","I don't understand reddit's love for this show. It was so generic. ","It was a police procedural.  The characters and people made the show.  ","There was a lot of solid futurology in the details as well, though unfortunately that's pretty niche.","I demand those in charge to immediately make this happen. In fact it is unacceptable the filming hasn't started yet. Cinema is a dead medium, no space for storytelling - this project has to be serialized and with that helmet Dredd has great staying power. Urban could be in these episodes for decades.\n\nI am Dutch. I was in San Francisco, just 100 meters off Turk Street in the Tenderloin in 2012, visiting for a few weeks. I was feral, high on several types of stimulants (modafinil, ritalin) and hypercharged. The days were sweltering hot, and I was just in transition, on Progynova and in a haze of adventurous spirit. I visit the Singularity University, Google Campus, Land's end, Chinatown, the whole lot. Then I noticed the premiere of Dredd in the cinema. So I went, late in the evening.\n\nI got kinda deep in the movie. *I forgot I was in the US during te movie*. So halfway the movie I was asking myself, \"where did I park my bike\" and I was thinking about getting some Showarma before going home. The movie blew me away, it was amazing. Then at 0100 at night I walked out of the cinema, out of full DREDD immersion and in to the sprawling hellish Dystopia that SanFran has become, hearing crazy homeless people howl from the tenderloin. *That was some surreal trip*. ","I really like your writing style.","Why thank you sweetheart","I didn't realize this was a thing I wanted.  Now I can't Un-want it.","I would love to see this happen. There are HUNDREDS of episodes worth of Dredd comics, as source material.","Fuck yeah ","That would be wonderful. Hope it's Netflix because I forget about Amazon Prime.","Shut up and take my money!","It's sad that Dredd fell under most people's radars. Even my friend who is the biggest 200AD and Dredd fan didn't see it at the cinema and I took me to show him a couple of scenes before he watched it. And then he regretted not seeing it sooner. I don't know if it was just bad marketing or what, but this has been the case with so many people. Dredd is a fantastic film and deserves so much more respect and recognition than it got. I'm rooting for Urban to make more!","&gt; my friend who is the biggest 200AD and Dredd fan didn't see it at the cinema\n\nI dispute his fan credentials!\n\nAlso here, you dropped this: 0","And too late for a ninja edit as well!","That would be amazing.

Film was undeniably good, but I really like comic dark comedy cannon.","He nailed that role. His scowl was perfect, his attitude, he truly embodied the role. I think a Netflix series like Daredevil would definitely be the best home for more Dredd.","Karl Urban is Dredd to me!  HE'S DREDD!!","In this instance, I agree with Karl Urban.","That would be awesome.  And if for some reason they don't go for that, maybe retry \"Almost Human\" again.  That show had a ton of potential.","This movie needs a series, there is so much source material to draw from. The writer, director, cast, everything, they did a fantastic job across the board.","So, I would watch Karl Urban in anything, but Dredd was awesome and sequels/series/anything else would be amazing. ","There are so many weird and awesome stories they could do. The movie we saw was pretty tame compared to all the weird robots, mutants, criminals, and the general world of Megacity and its outskirts. ","You had me at Karl Urban","Oh good god please. ","Hells yes.  I am very much down with this.  ","That would be nice.","So let him! There is so much they could do with Dredd and that whole world.","Was just talking about Dredd with the BF the other day.  Told him I'd kill for a sequel. A Netflix series would be aces.","OMG! I was just talking about this a few months ago! \n\nIs there anything I can do hey Netflix interested?","Who can we contact at Amazon or Netflix to make this happen? A series with Karl Urban would be epic, it could explore mega city one and have the series finale show a glimpse of the Dark Judges...see it is writing itself.","Dredd is a property that doesnt require a lot of cg, I think it could deff work well as a netflix/amazon show.","Yes please","I want Karl Ubran to do a Dredd series for Netflix or Amazon Prime.","yes please.","Yeah.","A Dredd Procedural would be Littttttt","Who currently holds the ability to license Dredd? Reliance Entertainment?","This would be amazing.","YES!! I loved this movie, one of my favorite Karl Urban performances.","An Almost Human Judge","That would be cool. Comics are pretty well suited to TV adaptation. Netflix has had success with Jessica Jones and Daredevil, so there's certainly a market there. ","This is one repost/xpost I am glad to upvote...\n\nThis needs to happen!","As much as I want to see this, I don't want it to be a low budget endeavour. Hopefully the series will happen and the producers give iiit a good budget.","I find it funny reading these posts, that could be summed up as \"actor wants a job.\" That said, I'd watch it.","I loved Keith Urban's rendition of one of Americas oldest folk tales. \n\nI think this Nextflick deal will be a huge step toward progress. ","What folk tale did he do, out of curiosity? ","The one about Judge Judy. ","This really just boils down to \"actor would like work\". ","Of course he does, it's a paycheck. That doesn't mean Netflix or Amazon want to.","I want Karl Urban to do a Dredd Series for Netflix of Amazon Prime! And I don't even know who Karl is.","I liked his Dredd, but it's best to leave it be and move on.

Interestingly, written at a highly transitional time for every single band member.  Nicks and Buckingham were in an extremely turbulent relationship which was coming to an end, John and Christine McVie had divorced and were barely speaking, and Fleetwood had just learned that his wife had been having an affair (to divorce soon afterwards).  I think it was the personal upheaval that caused them to put so much of themselves into each song.  Phenomenal album from start to finish.","if you listen to Go Your Own Way, its about the turbulent relationship that Nicks and Buckingham had.\n ","If I recall correctly Nicks began to hate Buckingham for the line\n\n\"Packing up, shacking up is all you wanna do\"\n\nHere's the exert from Wikipedia, it tells so much about the band at that time:\n\n\"Stevie Nicks asked Buckingham to remove the lyrics \"Packing up, shacking up is all you wanna do\", but Buckingham refused. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Nicks gave her thoughts on the matter. \"I very much resented him telling the world that 'packing up, shacking up' with different men was all I wanted to do. He knew it wasn't true. It was just an angry thing that he said. Every time those words would come onstage, I wanted to go over and kill him. He knew it, so he really pushed my buttons through that. It was like, 'I'll make you suffer for leaving me.' And I did.\"","The first three albums that ushered in the Buckingham Nicks Era of Fleetwood Mac were all truly astonishing.  Of those, Tusk is the one that really captures what I love most of this incarnation.  As far as \"The Chain\" goes, there is an incredible demo of this that has a slow instrumental build; highly recommended.","Holy shit, yes! Everyone likes to put Tusk down but I think it is truly some of their best songwriting especially for Stevie (even though the album was Lindsey's baby).","Big shout out for The Ledge, mainly because of its bonkers production: http://youtu.be/DuQFnVKrHuY\n\n","My 4 year old knows Tusk by the first bar and runs to the speaker! ","I absolutely agree.  Engineering and production feats aside, of all those period albums, Tusk still sounds new.  This probably has to do with its post-punk/ new wave edge paired with their signature song craft.  Who knows, but it speaks to me on an entirely different level.  I only hope these will get the Steve Hoffman Half-Mastered treatment soon.","that sounds amazing, you got a link?","https://youtu.be/CEIEFdNg7ZA","It's an album all about people cheating on each other.

Needs good headphones with some decent  bass to get full effect.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/lpVCL00fPAc","The Dance is how I first got into Fleetwood Mac years ago after searching through all of my mom's CDs. I loved it so much I bought the DVD. It's such an amazing live performance.","Me too! I basically grew up on the live album. My parents had that on CD, but most of the others were on records and i wasn't allowed to use the record player as a kid. Listened to The Dance so much that I prefer the live versions of most of the songs now. The live version of this song might be my favorite from Fleetwood Mac altogether. ","How the hell is that audience sitting down during this performance. I'd be standing ON my seat. ","I was a teenager when The Dance first aired, I think on VH1, and it was the year I'd first learned to play guitar. I was into mostly metal and industrial at the time, but had an ear for classic rock too, so I'd heard of Fleetwood Mac but never really listened to them.\n\nI watched this and I was hooked from the intro of The Chain all the way through the end. I remember seeing this and Big Love later on in the show and thinking, \"How the hell does he do that?\" I learned about Travis picking and practiced for years until I could finally nail both of those songs. This live show and album completely changed my personal playing style as a musician, and definitely hooked me into a more eclectic musical fandom where I was willing to draw inspiration from anything.\n\nThanks for posting this! Lindsey will forever make my list as one of the greatest guitarists of all-time, and most definitely in the top of the list of most underrated guitarists of all time.\n\n[Big Love, from The Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZp76M4NGc)","The bass solo is amazing!","John in such an under appreciated genius. I think he is one of the best bass players of all time but I may be a tad bias since they're my favorite band.","Every bass player I've ever played with has whipped this one out at least once in rehearsal.","Their song [Rhiannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_aYibUx1B8) and their live rendition of [Landslide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK2HAfb3rC0) are also fantastic","I was so annoyed the other day when i went to listen to both of those songs only to find I don't have a copy of \"Fleetwood Mac\" on LP...\n\nThat album plus Rumours are fantastic. ","\"The Dance\" is one of the best live albums of all time.  \n\nI grew up on that album, many hours riding with my parents absolutely SCREAMING along to [Tusk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrRVW-p8SJ8).  I can't even imagine how badass it must have been in person to see Mick Fleetwood come back out on stage and start banging that shit out.\n\nEdit: [This was what they played next in case anyone was wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgwRYjDhK_E)\n\nAlso amazing: [From their 2003 show in Boston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dff2XCh3Ass)  - Solidified Lindsey Buckingham as one of the most badass dudes alive IMO.

I believe Stevie described the concert as, \"As magic as it gets...it was.\" I tend to agree.  That whole performance is amazing.  ","They're both always amazing live as is Silver Springs (but especially on The Dance). Landslide is going to be my father-daughter dance song for my wedding in July. Had to incorporate The Mac in there somehow!! :)","If you are too cool for Fleetwood Mac, you might just be too cool.","Saw them in Perth last year whilst it was pouring down rain, was fantastic, thoroughly enjoyed it.","This has always been my favorite song. I heard it for the first time while camping with a bunch of hooligans. Great introduction to music.","This one is great, but my favorites are Never Going Back Again and Gold Dust Woman.

","Good old Steamy Nicks.","to the day it reminds me of damon hill in his williams car in formula one,the bridge used to be the opening music of F1 on the BBC when i was a kid. ","favorite part of 2015 was randomly hearing this on the radio in a heavy rainstorm just driving down the 5 in California. ","I wish music like this was still in fashion ... M83 tried to use this type of vibe in their new album, but it fell a little flat.","I'm pretty sure The Pixies based their entire sound on the outro of this song.","Bummmm Bum Bum BUM Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bummmmmm","That guitar solo is so damn good.","Oh, god, I love this song. My favorite is definitely the version off The Dance, though. Actually, The Dance is probably my absolute favorite Fleetwood Mac album ever.   \n\nMy best friend and I used to listen to it constantly. Her wedding song was actually Big Love (the guitar work on that song is nothing short of incredible). I remember that her parents used to make fun of us constantly because it was more their generation’s music than ours.  ","I feel like posting any song off of Rumours in this subreddit is like cheating haha ","Not sure if someone has already mentioned this but for those of you who love the Rumours album and this song in particular, check out the super deluxe album release and the demo version of The Chain. It's much different--only Stevie; acoustic. The riff in what we now know as The Chain is featured in a song that Christine sang, called Keep Me There. ","That bass line tho ","I cannot stop listening to this song! Plus im a huge fan of 80's music, classic rock, 80's pop, generally any 80's music especially Fleetwood Mac!","It's amazing that this album came out in 77, at that!  Rumours was so ahead of its time for sure.  ","Fleetwood Mac has been my favorite band since I was 15 years old (now 28) and I was so amazingly fortunate to get to see them live about 3 years ago. Gah! They're just so amazing. I still enjoy the music they're putting out more recently but nothing compares to Rumours. It's an untouchable album imo.","I've been a fan since I was about 15, too, though I'm a few years older than you (wocka wocka). I often joke that my memorabilia collection is my kids' college fund, but it's a joke because I can't see myself selling anything (I specialize in artwork/photography and records - I've even got all the old bootleg albums from the 70s). I've seen Stevie solo 5 times, Lindsey solo once, and the Mac as a whole twice. Perfection every time. I even got Lindsey to sign my Tusk lithograph - next to Stevie's Rhiannon painting, it is my most prized piece.","I've collected all of their LPs (and some before Lindsey, Stevie, and Christine joined) and a few of the their old posters but besides that I only have current concert/fan shirts. I am completely blessed to have such a sweet fiance who got me Fleetwood Mac tickets for our first Christmas together 3 years ago (which he always says he set the bar too high lol) and it was literally one of the highlights of my life. As soon as they started to perform I immediately broke into tears because I thought I'd never get the chance to see them. Of course, Christine wasn't with them at that concert and she rejoined shortly after we saw them (which is a bummer since Songbird is one of my favorite songs) but it was still amazing and they went for around 3 1/2 hours!!","\"Oh Well\" is the only Fleetwood Mac song I ever liked. That bassline was fucking sick. The rest of their music reminds me of all the other soft rock they played at my orthodontist's office in the early '90s. ","That's because that was a completely different band. The original line up, fronted by Peter Green, with Danny Kirwan joining later, was outselling both the Stones and The Beatles. Check out \"Rattlesnake Shake\", and \"The Green Manalishi\"  from *Live in Boston* to listen to them in their prime. ","\"Man of the world\" is also absolutely sickening song","I can't believe that slipped my mind, it's one of my favourites!","The night is so black that the darkness cooks","**DUH DE DUH DE DUH, DUH DUH**","That makes a lot of sense. I never understood why a band capable of such awesomeness wiild spend decades being not very awesome. Thanks for the info.","No problem! \n\nThe reason for the change in line up was essentially Green leaving for disputed reasons, Jeremy Spencer running off to join a cult (Children of God in LA I believe), and Kirwan becoming an alcoholic and uncooperative. There was a period that straddled the pop and the blues iterations which featured Bob Welch and Weston also.","The reason for the change in line up was essentially Green leaving for disputed reasons.......\n\nThis makes me so sad, I believe if Green hadn't have took that trip he'd have been recognised as one of the best, some have all the technique but no emotion, the opening of \"need your love so bad\" gets me everytime, same  as \"I loved another woman\"\n\n\"He's the only one who gave me the cold sweats\" ","Fleetwood Mac was much better before they got the chicks. Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.","I like to just think of them as two separate, awesome groups that shared a common name.  Kinda the opposite of Jefferson Airplane/Starship","For the life of me, I will never understand how this sub works.","That's okay. You'll be okay.","Why have I never heard of this band? I've been listening to my local classic rock radio station for years and never once heard of them. \n\nPeople keep mentioning *Rhiannon*.

As well, you have the spotify type service that works well and has a decent selection. Then you also have the photo backup. Personally, I would get rid of Netflix and Spotify before Prime.

","Sure lesson learnt, but there are some lessons that you can learn without being stupid af.\n\nDo you really need to drive over the speed limit, get into an accident, possibly get injuries, to know that speeding can cause accidents?\n\nNo.\n\nSomething more nuanced like not exercising your employee rights properly and then overworking/getting paid less or something like that can be a lesson learn from experience. But strictly stupid things are stupid.","In some cases, you probably do need to get into an accident before realizing that you shouldn't speed.  Sure, people know that speeding could cause an accident.  However, there is a massive difference between \"some people get in accidents when they speed\" and \"if I speed, there's a good chance that I will get in an accident\".  It's easy to rationalize things away with \"others could, but I'm better/smarter/faster/etc so it won't happen to me\".\n\nAlso, you have to ask the right question before you can find the obvious answer.  Say there's a pot of boiling water on the stove.  Someone goes to pick it up without pot holders and burns themself.  Is that a stupid mistake?  Yes.  Of course the pot is hot, its been on the stove for the last 20 minutes.  And of course hot things can burn you.  Is that a mistake that a smart person shouldn't have made?  Eh.\n\nIn day to day life (assuming you don't spend much time in the kitchen), you can generally pick up just about everything without worrying about heat.  In that case, you probably assume that temperature isn't an issue without every consciously thinking about it.  Now, you are dealing with a new experience (cooking on a stove), and that assumption is no longer valid.  However, the whole point of an assumption is that you aren't consciously thinking about it.  Therefore, you continue to assume subconsciously that heat isn't an issue and you burn yourself on a hot stove.  It is extraordinarily stupid, but it is a perfectly understandable mistake to make (once, at least).","&gt; Do you really need to drive over the speed limit, get into an accident, possibly get injuries, to know that speeding can cause accidents?\n\nyeah... even though I agree with you, I just read that you don't own a car so... maybe you should choose another example until then...

Still saying it's a bad bad idea, but my point is it's not an idea, there is no decision process involved here...

There is no lesson to be learned here. Even a driver, who HASN'T been in a speeding accident, knows that he is mistaking a mistake by speeding. \n\nIn conclusion, some lessons don't require mistakes to be made to be learned. Those are called common sense. And I am arguing that this $600 was not a simple mistake necessary to be made to learn that spending someone else's money IRRESPONSIBLY has repercussions. ","&gt;wait wait wait. WTF. Just because I don't own a car doesn't mean I haven't been in one.  \n  \nbut you haven't been like ten thousand times in a situation where pushing that gas pedal just a little more without even thinking about it could save your ass... is what I meant.   \nAnyways I indeed got kinda lost in my own comment at some point and don't remember exactly what I really wanted to say about games and microtransactions at first. Something like \"buying another microtransaction is like driving over the limit by a couple mph, it seems harmless and the more you do it the more it seems like you can get away with it, until you fuck up big time\"  \n","Are you really trying to argue that going 1 mile an hour over the speed limit is always a mistake?  Going too fast is clearly a mistake.  \"Too fast\" doesn't necessarily have a close connection to the speed limit.  There are a lot of places where the speed limit is X and I know damn well that it is completely safe (in good conditions, at least) to do X+Y.  If it is raining/snowing/dark/whatever, sure, I will slow down (possibly to below the speed limit, depending on the conditions).  That doesn't mean that going over the speed limit is always unsafe.\n\nFor that matter, there are also a lot of situations where going 10 over the speed limit is safer than going 5 under the speed limit -- if everyone around you is going at a given speed, matching them will be safer than praying that the guy behind you notices you and doesn't rear end you.\n\nI guess this might be culture dependent to an extent.  In the US (or at least the mid atlantic/northeast), people tend to assume that the enforced speed limit is actually 10mph higher than the listed limit, and I think that listed limits are often lowered to counteract that.  Is that a pretty stupid system?  Yes.  Fixing it is somewhat harder, though.","Difference being I had the foresight to never HAVE to learn from my mistakes. \"oops lol sorry bro guess you're out 600 dollars\" isn't justified because you \"learn you lesson\" afterwards.","What's it like to be born with perfect foresight?

Hell, if you're growing up with technology and gaming you know what microtransactions are and that they need money","I remember (and this was back in the day of those Nokia bricks) managing to rack up a $300 phone bill in a month by sending texts and IMs in about 2003. 14 year olds are wildly irresponsible. ","1) Kids are idiots. Adults are simply bigger kids.\n\n2) You'd be surprised how little kids know about the actual worth of money. $600 to me seemed so little to me when I was a kid, until I started interning and working and realizing how much $15 meant (an hour of hard labor). You bet your ass I'm economical. Within reason. Accounting for biases and habits. And liquor. \n\n3) Kids can get emotional and angry and spiteful and vengeful and wanting to get attention etc. I've seen far worse than spending stolen $600. ","I remember looking at car advertisements before I ever had a job and I knew 40k was an expensive car, but a 12k car? Anybody with a job could afford that! I can very easily see the scale of things being lost on a 14 year old. ","As /u/that_badest_dude said, people can be dumb, but there is a lot of value in finding the cause of a problem.  Even if the kid knew he was spending his brother's money, it's unlikely that it was out of malice.  \n\nIt's important to learn why the kid thought it was OK to use his brother's money.  This develops a base level of trust in the kid's character that he needs to know his parents have in him.  \n\nUnderstanding this will allow him to direct future discussions of his mistakes into \"this is why I did this, why am I wrong?\"  This question is important because his mistakes will get more complicated as he gets older, and it is a question he will have to ask himself in adulthood.","My 20 year old brother has his bank account tied onto a Clash of Clans account and GTA 5 online. My 13 year old brother uses both of them and got into the habit of spending money on in game transactions. I don't know what he was thinking, or if he was not thinking about it at all, but he managed to rack up about $2,850 dollars worth of purchases total. \nMy older brother is incredibly passive and allows people to step on him alot so he was going to keep it a secret. I, not wanting it to happen again, informed my parents who were livid about it. They told him that what he did was not something that you could classify as just a little thing. They told him that he would be working every summer from here on out to repay him for what he has spent.","When I was that age, I was dumb enough to believe a porn site which said they didn't need your bank account information for money, they just needed it to confirm your age.

One month later $600 in charges had been racked up thanks to the website apparently sharing the account information with a bunch of other sites I had never even heard of.\n\nObviously this isn't exactly what happened here, but we also have little to no information from the parent other than \"I think he's lying\". It's dumb to assume that this was as malicious as everyone is making it seem. The microtransactions seem most likely, and coupled with the fact that $600 is so far beyond the scale at which most 14-year-olds would think, I feel like this was probably a mistake that the kid either doesn't realize happened or now that he's been confronted with it is petrified of admitting to it because he's realizing what actually happened.","I need to know what happen next.","To me? Nothing really. My dad wasn't very happy but got all the charges cancelled/refunded and we never talked about it again.","Happened to me with MapleStory NX cash when I was bout 12.

Having assumed guilt before investigating thoroughly and driven someone to tears, you should explain what they did wrong and ask for an apology. If they lie then you should take something away from them. That's parenting advice, not workplace advice.

The latter could be phishing.","Elsewhere in the thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/4fq6v9/serious14_year_old_stole_600_of_17_year_olds/d2c7os1\n\n&gt;OP here: thanks for the help everyone. The purchases made were in the form of \"points\" mostly at $19.99/transaction. They were purchased to be used on two sports games only the 14 year old plays.\n\nThis is pretty clearly not a phishing practice. Phishing generally would be someone spending all that money on ps4 gift cards and then reselling it to others.\n\nIt's almost 100% certain that the 14-year-old is guilty, and that he knew exactly what he was doing. Almost every microtransaction requires a verification process for the purchases to be made on the card. I do agree with /u/This_Vicious_Cabaret in that microtransaction opportunities can be difficult for younger children to understand, like 8-10 year olds who are still fuzzy with real world transactions, let alone video game ones. But a 14 year old? Unless he's got a serious learning disability, at this age he definitely knew what he was doing. I was very very clear at that age what required real money and what did not.","I think you're right in that he likely knew he was spending real money and that it was wrong, but I can see the point that it could have been the *scale* that escaped him. I've seen it in kids and even young adults before who are new to managing finances. Put some money on the card, give it a week...hey, nobody said anything. I got away with it. And now it's out of their mind; it's like it never happened, and they go ahead and do it again. It's not until the bill comes due that they realize how much they spent.\n\nApparently these charges were over the span of a couple months. It's not like he sat down and burned $600 in one night. He probably spent $20 here, $40 there, never kept track of how much it was or took the time to add it up, and then OH SHIT dad and bro are PISSED because it's...$600? Holy crap did I really spend that much? Nah...nah, couldn't have. *Deny deny deny*. Same thing happens to many adults when they get their first credit card bill and realize that all those little this-and-that purchases add up to a bunch of money *that they still have to come up with*.

The whole goal behind this is not to show that if you get caught you get punished, but regardless of what happened or who is to blame, the family unit has to deal with the consequences.","14 year olds do not have a lot of empathy yet.

Ideally, it should be something constructive (like a repayment plan or some other, less direct restitution)*\n\n\nRepaying the money is not optional, or \"one of the options\", it's critical, the 14YO stole from the 17YO, if the 14YO is not able to be responsible for this the parents need to step in and make up the difference. I'd damn well expect the parents to empty the 14YOs bank account and sell all his posessions to make up that $600. Even if the parents pay for some of it they need to make sure the 14YO is the one who suffers, \"no sorry we can't pay for your guitar lessons because we gave you the money your brother stole\" is just as bad as leaving the 17Yo without the money.\n\n\nAnyone who thinks this family unit is going to function if the money is not paid back is divorced from reality, if the younger brother is allowed to get away with this without paying back the money then the family is done for.

This money was hard earned, he did hard dirty work for. If I was that 17YO everytime I saw them spend money on somemthing like ice cream for the family I'd be seeing that as my money, apparently there's money to spend on my little brother who stole $600 from me but not money to give me back some of that $600.","Given the information the OP provided, it seems that the 14 year old used the brother's card for his video games. We can discuss intent all we want, but in the end, the younger brother (possibly by accident) ended up costing his brother $600. \n\nPersonally, I think this is a great time to teach the 14 year old and the 17 year old a few lessons. In the real world if you cause someone harm, even without any mal intent, you still need to pay. Just today I saw someone unloading their van, and they hit the car next to them, causing a slight dent. The person who did the damage did not do so intentionally, and wasn't even particularly reckless, he just made a bad move and now needs to pay. Similarly, I will assume the 14 year old was not being malicious, or even understood the impact of his actions, but guess what, he caused harm and should pay up. He is old enough to get a part time job (a few hours each weekend) doing dishes, working for McDonalds, bussing tables, etc. to pay off the debt.\n\nAs for trust, the father needs to present the evidence and ask the 14 year old one more time if he did it. If he refuses to admit fault, he loses privileges to use the PS4. If not he has full right to use it, but under a separate account. The PS4 is a privilege, and if the 14 year old cannot even admit to his wrong doing, he loses the privilege. Being an adult is owning up to your wrong doings.\n\nAs for the 17 year old, you need to teach him the ability to accept apologies, and forgive wrong doings if the 14 year old works to pay him back. It also is a good time to teach him to review his account information to ensure false charges do not go through.","u/This_Vicious_Cabaret gives the kind of weak parenting advice that makes for the kids that steal your car stereos. 14 year olds already had a chance to learn about honesty.

Before then I just didn't check it that often (maybe once a month?) because I just never used a debit card. For my credit card, I'd just look through my statement quickly about once a week and see if there was anything that I didn't pay for and dispute it if needed. I've had to do this maybe 3x in my adult life. The disputes are usually resolved within the month and I don't have to pay for it. It took ~5 minutes a week. With my current budgeting app, it's automatic and I don't really have to do anything.\n\n&gt;The bank won't care, but small claims court will (if they're both adults).\n\nGood luck with that when (as has happened to one friend of mine) your debit card is skimmed from a machine and you are out over $1k and you don't even know who did it. And even if you knew the person, do you really think it's easy to just go to court to get it back? It's a serious cost in time and some money. Why not avoid it in the first place?\n\nSeriously, if you are using debit cards for everyday transactions, you are putting yourself at completely  unnecessary risk. [I'm far from the only person who thinks this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbarro/2012/04/03/why-you-should-never-use-debit-cards/#2858e3b5eb6b). [More good reason not to use a debit card](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/01/14/why-you-should-never-use-your-debit-card.aspx)","The issue with this is that a 17 year old is much better off with a debit card than a credit card, they can only spend money they have. You are saying its this kid's fault his brother is a shit head, and it's not. I had my purse stolen and they used my debit card to buy some things, I called the bank and the money was back within days.","&gt;You are saying its this kid's fault his brother is a shit head\n\nWhere did I say this? I specifically said it wasn't (and his brother definitely should be punished in some way). I'm saying that his financial management skills are shit and that clearly needs guidance because he didn't notice for *2 months* and he's using a debit card for everyday expenses. He has zero recourse to ever get his money back because of both those things. In the real world that could have easily been his entire checking account and now he can't pay rent and he gets evicted.\n\nHere, let me put it this way: Imagine if I leave $600 in an envelope on my front porch and don't check on it for months on end and it ends up missing. Yeah, it's not my fault that it's stolen, but I also shouldn't have been as careless with it.\n\nIf this were with a credit card, that would be one thing. You have much better legal protections with those. There's a reason why most financial advisers tell you never to use debit.","Just to offer a different perspective, I check my credit card and bank balances online (on mobile) every few days. I keep a budget, as well as a ledger of everything I spend, so I keep close track on my spending, keep receipts, watch balances, etc etc.\n\nSo it's definitely possible to be vigilant about your finances. And its well worth it, in my opinion.","My bank's app sends me notifications every day about how much is in my account and will send me an alert if my savings dip below a certain point. It gives me peace of mind after having gotten ripped off in the past.","This is sort of accurate. My family isn't 1%, but definitely upper 10%. But for people living in the bottom 50, even someone having just crested over 50% is seen by them as \"rich\"\n\nThe difference between making $18k a year working at starbucks, and 50k a year working the average 9-5 is seen as some kind of personal attack against the less wealthy individual.\n\nThats why Bernie Sanders has been so successful in gaining traction from the uneducated, unskilled working populace who have little to no income in comparison to what [even CNN claims to be the median](http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/income-rank/).\n\nIf people would take a step back and examine why they truly are in the situation they are in, it would be clear its because they didn't invest in themselves as an individual. I don't even live under my parents anymore, and I am *fucking poor* now in comparison. Sure I have that safety net if shit ever truly hit the fan, but the way it is now, I'm on my own with zero assistance. I have taken loans for school, instead of using family money. I drive a car from the 90s, and am rather frugal about my spending. (Simply because after bills and expenses, I am broke)\n\nYes I had a decent upbringing, yes I generally had everything I could need, and a good bit of what I want. But dismissing me as an individual based on the fact that I come from a family which has the means to provide for itself and can afford multiple houses and vacations is just silly.\n\n-------------------\n\nJust as a side note. 50% (median income) is $52k a year. top 10% is $160k... 1% is $450k a year.\n\nThe difference between those three numbers is astronomical, and usually most of that money isn't sitting as cash in a bank account, I truly doubt the majority of top 5%+ have access to a majority of their money.","Buddy, no one was hating on you, they were just observing that, yes, your parents are rich. I don't know why you had to make this all political.","He is talking bullshit, 450k is not 1%:\n\nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/the-top-1-percentand-01-percentof-every-age-group-in-america/382094/\n\nAnd all in all his entire post is kinda BS","Then they should invest in themselves, and while working at mcdonalds go to school. We all did it, but I do not feel we should be suggesting that a lifelong career as a part time drive through cashier is something to aspire to.","15k is full time at minimum wage, not part time. ","Working at McDonald's (or any minimum wage job) doesn't even come close to paying for college tuition, so you're saying my choices are\n\nA.) Work minimum wage forever, or\n\nB.) \"Invest in myself\" putting myself thousands of dollars in debt and hoping I'll land a better job once I'm out of college?\n\nI'm glad there are people like you out there who are fortunate enough to have their parents ease them into early adulthood, but the fact is, for the vast majority of us, it isn't that simple.","&gt;I'm glad there are people like you out there who are fortunate enough to have their parents ease them into early adulthood\n\nI paid 700 a month rent living with my parents until I moved out. Not because they needed the money, but on principal. \n\nI put myself thousands of dollars into debt taking loans out for college (with no benefits of coming from a struggling family like you would get) \n\nI don't want to hear about how bad it is for you with all the social programs setup to help people like you. ","I actually get zero benefits currently with the way the system is set up. I am too poor to afford college and most leisure based activities, and have within the past few years, had to decide between food and rent multiple times. Yet make slightly above the limit to receive food assistance and other types of assistance. There are zero industry based jobs where I live so even if I did go to college and put myself in crippling debt I would likely only be able to get a job in middle management at somewhere like target (which, yes, requires degrees for middle management, no clue why.)\n\nI will say that you seem to be an exception to the \"rich parents\" rule, which is fantastic and I'm glad you are being a decent human being and building character for yourself. I had wrongfully assumed your parents had paid for your college (as most do nowadays) and for that I am sorry. I have too many people in my life who are spoiled little brats getting by on daddy and mommy's money and telling others they just need to \"like, go to college.\" So that sort of mindset rubs me the wrong way. Again, sorry for assuming.","&gt;I am too poor to afford college\n\nhttp://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/index.html\n\nhttp://www.pheaa.org/funding-opportunities/state-grant-program/\n\nhttps://fafsa.ed.gov/\n\n\n&gt;here are zero industry based jobs where I live so even if I did go to college and put myself in crippling debt I would likely only be able to get a job in middle management at somewhere like target\n\nMove\n\n&gt; I have too many people in my life who are spoiled little brats getting by on daddy and mommy's money and telling others they just need to \"like, go to college.\"\n\nHow do you know those people if there are no good, lucrative jobs near you? How do their parents have money?\n\nYou just contradicted yourself.\n\nEDIT: Also, one of my best friends enlisted. He is now receiving college education for free, in addition, he is receiving additional money for housing. Though I didn't want to bring that up since most people don't want to serve under current administration.","1.) Yay, $4,000 in loans! Just what I needed, thanks! .... You really think I haven't looked into financial aid?\n\n2.) Moving costs money.\n\n3.) Most of my friends are through the internet and in different states.\n\n4.) Not willing to risk my life in exchange for an education because that's fucked up.","There are a lot of people who work two part time or even three part time jobs at min wage to take care of their kids. When exactly should they go to school? If you invest 40 hours a week somewhere, you should not live on food stamps to survive. Not all people can just go to school, learn a trade or work their way up to assistant store manager for a whopping $11 an hour, which is still not enough to live on. People need to survive. The US is one of the richest countries in the world, and yet almost 50 million people live in food insecure homes. No matter who it is, someone will always have to flip your burgers and do the dishes and serve your food. Those people deserve to be able to feed their families. Not everyone is smart enough to go to college or work their way up a bureaucratic ladder. Everyone deserves to get paid enough money to live on. If minimum wage had kept up with inflation, it would be over $20 by now.  ","And there are lots of people who make a ton more what's your point?","Reddit is home to the bernie crowd, so yeah. They are probably upset that over a decade ago I spent their yearly income in a month.","I make enough money that I comfortably spent roughly $30k last month and I still think you sound like a bit of a prick. ","&gt;comfortably spent $30k last month\n\nExtrapolating on that, I'd wager a guess that you are top10. Or that was a one off expense (such as buying a car, which generally wont happen again for half a decade)\n\nIf its a one time expense, that was saved up for and expected, and still \"comfortable\" then I'd say thats not out of the ordinary. Infact, buying something like a car outright is such a better decision than accepting a 5 year loan.\n\nIf however you mean that in a way where you could do it again in a few months, I'd say you probably make in excess of 300k a year.","And why does that even matter?\nHis point is that he doesn't make 15k a year which you accused all your critics of doing.
