I noticed it right away on the first go round while viewing on my phone! Maybe 30 hours for it is a bit intense, but it was still awesome.\n\nAlso: Did anyone else feel strangely sorry for the little tank as it fell? I know it's silly but I got emotionally invested in the little feller.","opinions are like assholes ","Not every asshole has an opinion though.","As someone who knows nothing about rendering this simulation looks like you pointed the physics tank up hill and pressed play on the simulation. What are the render times for? Is that just how long it took for the program to calculate all of the physical effects going on or did you have some sort of manual input? ","I think the render times are for the graphical rendering. If you play pc games it's like setting the graphics to ultra and it goes frame by frame. Though intense physics can also make it go frame by frame","So why is it that I can get an physics engine that works in realtime like Algodoo or Nvidia Flex, but cool stuff like this takes hours to render? I was hoping to be able to mess around with this in realtime with Blender.","The time is primarily for rendering - I.e. Generating realistic photos and/or video.\n\nYou can mess with realtime physics in blender but you won't have all that nice simulated lighting you have herd","Oh cool. I know that the point of everything here is for it to look good so good lighting's important, I might mess around with ugly physics.","If you want realize that falls under the government of video game engines. When working with 3d assets utilizing blender, cinema4d, 3dsmax (the list goes on and on) the physics must be simulated and rendered. Simulation is exactly what you think, the process of calculating dynamics (using math none of us would ever want to do) and rendering is the calculation of light, materials, camera placement, motion and much more to determine what color pixel x of millions is (almost 1 million for one frame @ 1280x720.\nThe reason why it's not real time is its all done with the cpu. Video games utilize engines that preload and cache shaders, have already done the necessary calculations and have preset algorithms in place so that they can utilize a gpu to handle everything. Physics are still done on the cpu but video game physics aren't as accurate as fully simmed physics so they're less taxing. \nHope that helps...\n","It does, but what if you had physics with no shaders? Just gross black and white or random colors?","It still has to calculate geometry, you could have 1:1 perfect simmed physics of say for instance 2d particles, which is where plugins like x-particles and other point based physics systems come in.\nAs long as there is geometry and complex dynamics, the OP posted the non-rendered software display which doesn't look bad but it's not pretty. ","Simulation time refers to calculating the physics in one go and cache the simulation result to my RAM or Harddisk. This allows playback at near real-time to look for errors or behavior I don't want, it also allows me to animate my camera to something that I know isn't going to change.\n\nBut graphically what I get looks like [&gt;this&lt;](https://gfycat.com/RingedUglyGalapagosdove) basically looks like a videogame or worse.\n\nRendering is what turns it into well shadowed, glossy, motion blurred beautiful video.","That is very interesting. Thanks for explaining it.","What are your system specs?","* **processor:** core i7 5930K OC to 4.4GHz\n\n* **RAM:** 64 gigs\n\n* **GPU:** GTX980 Ti 6144 MB\n\nOnly reason I got the Ti instead of a normal GTX980 was because I wanted moar RAM for rendering\n\n","Our PC specs are almost the same, except I use an i7-5820K OC'ed to 4.3GHz. I don't regret getting 64 GB RAM for my 3D stuff. Money well spent.","Do you actually need that much RAM to do 3D rendering work or do you just like to have it just in case?","While I don't *need* that much RAM it's very nice to have.\n\nI do a lot of particle water stuff and cache it all to RAM because it's much faster. I can now simply leave multiple large projects open for the duration of working on them, have old revisions open for reference, stuff like that. I can easily walk past 30 gigs and not bat an eye.\n\nPreviously I would have to close one set of things to make way for another set and waiting for 5-10 gigs worth of stuff to load off the harddisk and into programs is a pain when I might be flip flopping between projects a lot.\n\nP.S. It comes in handy with games too, I can stuff MGS: V The Phantom Pain onto a 30 gig RAM disk and load maps faster than any SSD could.","Nice.","Damn, that's amazing. Now I want 64 gigs of RAM.

I'm always test rendering stuff, just when I'm finishing for the day or whatever, to see if I'm going to run into something unexpected etc. Also, there's a few decent online render farms where you can upload your file to render in minutes. I'm on a 2011 i7 iMac, so I use them a bunch for my 3D stuff.

","I just stumbled across this subreddit and this looks dope as shit, do you know if you can do these simulations on a cluster computing network?

The smoke just vanishes unnaturally at that point.","&gt; The smoke just vanishes unnaturally at that point.\n\nYup, got frustrated how many errors and bad frames I was getting at that point. Stopped rendering and faded it out in compositing hoping no one would notice (or care)","Stick with particles for now, unless the smoke is the focus of your piece. Much easier to work with, and non-graphics-enthusiasts will never notice it, plus it should be faster. Other than that, this was fantastic work.

How did you learn about blender and how to use it? 2. What hardware is best to render something like your simulation? Thanks","Learning a program like Blender is kinda like trying to learn a game like World of Warcraft, except you start at level 100 and there wasn't a tutorial.\n\nYou have to strip it down to the basics and take it in bite sized pieces like how the interface works, how to manipulate objects in 3D space, etc.\n\nThe best way to do this is to simply set yourself small incremental goals and use Blender a lot. Watch tutorials and copy them. [This is a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHVYYMG3QVY); in the lower left corner it shows which hotkeys he uses and can give you a good idea of what features and keys get used most for moving objects and the camera around.\n\nWhen you get stuck try finding more specific info or tutorials about that issue, sometimes if you're **really** stuck, looking up the methods behind a feature can help, for example what does rigid body actually mean? what does convex hull collision mean?\n\nThe good news though, computer simulations are better-suited to work with very simple 3D models. Minimalistic designs can still be very good looking.\n\nAs for rendering, I used Blender's Cycles renderer which allows ray-tracing to be done on my graphics card. nVidia was the fastest at rendering and supported the most render features for a while but I hear AMD is catching up. Although rendering on your CPU isn't the end of the world if it's relatively new and high-end.\n\nMaking a render look *nice* is actually a skill-set itself separate from how technically good your render is(just look at the original Toy Story). Looking at references like how professionals light products or general real life lighting tutorials can mesh well with learning how lights work and look good inside a 3D program.\n\nLearning something new will always be frustrating but eventually the payoff will outweigh the pain. Hope this was helpful. :D","Thanks man really appreciate the reply will try this out.","\"Learning a program like Blender is kinda like trying to learn a game like World of Warcraft, except you start at level 100 and there wasn't a tutorial.\"\nI was a java web application programmer before I retired, which is probably one of, if not the most complicated system to learn.

But big buildings is going to be a looong while off. \n\nThe best option for things like that is split the building into bunches of bricks, you'd get better performance but it won't look as good.(it's essentially big bricks)\n\nAlternatively, \"build\" the buildings out of something bigger. I'd suggest some sort of panelling, but then you need to consider indentations from other rigid bodies. \n\nThere's too many variables to say for sure.","Rust is kind of like that.","Actually a real-time specialized physics engine could probably do this fast enough to build gameplay around it.\n\nAn example that comes close is a game called [Besiege](http://store.steampowered.com/app/346010/)\n\nMy tank by itself without the broken ground or the 5000 brick building simulates at 23 frames per second and could probably go faster with some optimization.\n\nBig game companies ignore massive physics because\n\n* console CPU power isn't going to get faster for a while\n* it's very hard to sync so many object over multiplayer","I have besiege. There's very few physics objects in the game, and the calculation like takes exponentially longer as you add more objects.","The simulation is so-so, but I love the smoothness.","Guys, pls no downvoterinoing this poor soul.\n\n/u/obviously_suspicious speaks the truth, everything surrounding the tank took maybe 30 minutes of setup. Though the tank took longer to make work it's still very simple (really, look at the .blend file. it's just hinges and motors).\n\nThe real reason people like my animation is because of the presentation and rendering like 60FPS to make it smooth, vivid colors so people click the thumbnail, not having any dead time at beginning or end to make it easy to watch over and over again.\n\nBut the fact still stands that if it were only the tank with nothing to crash into it would be 'so-so'.

It differs from show to show, but most of them are like that. ","Most *bad* kids shows are like that. Good ones have characters that work on two levels, one where they're amazingly stereotypical, and one where they're really fleshed out and have long running motivations that you can read into if you pay attention. \n\nBut really, it seems like every show with multiple writers and a decently sized cast does that. Star Trek almost always had a big enough cast that some characters are just around to fulfill their stereotype and then get out of the way of a story. Kirk runs into an injured life form, waves over McCoy, who scans it with the tricorder, frowns, says something, Kirk doesn't get it, Spock gets it and makes a comment, Kirk keeps looking confused, McCoy explains better, Kirk understands, asks if McCoy can do anything, \"Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a _\" and then Kirk runs off to shoot/punch/screw somebody/thing. \n\nThere, I just described roughly a quarter of the original series. I could do the same with Ponies (to a lesser extent as the series went on), but I could do the same with House (\"It's never lupus\"), or any of a ton of other formulaic shows like that. The characters take their turns developing behind their stereotypes, but the stereotypes don't change much. That's just the nature of most TV, and even the shows which attempt to avoid that kind of slice-of-life-ness seem about evenly split between older and younger audiences. \n\nEdit: I guess the full sequence actually has Spock explain what McCoy said, and then Kirk goes \"but what does that have to do with _?\", and then McCoy drops the bombshell plot twist, and then Kirk asks if McCoy can do anything..., or there's a commercial break.
