{"politics":[],"pics":[["Any self-respecting board designer finds somewhere to sneak in an easter egg here and there.  \n\nInternally we used X-Men for codenames, there are X-Men silhouettes etched into inner copper layers on every PCB I've designed in the past few years.\n\nEdit: I just remembered that I once sent a prelim set of manufacturing files to a coworker for review and somewhere several layers in there was an elaborate dick drawn all across one copper layer.  This was before we were using version control though, so I don't have the files to prove it.","Is it possible to see? If you shine light through it or something?","It depends on the setup.  Circuit boards are made of multiple alternating layers of copper and fiberglass.  The light will shine through fiberglass and not copper.  If you want a \"watermark\" effect, you need to cut a positive on one copper layer, and a negative on all the rest of the copper layers, or at least a keepout area around the positive.\n\nI typically work on the 12-20 layer count side of things, so I rarely have room to spare on every layer to accomplish the watermark, but I have pulled it off on some 4 and 6 layer boards.\n\nEdit: I recently had a customer's co-worker suggest I throw a \"Hello Kitty\" logo onto the silkscreen of the board.  I happily obliged.","Jesus 20 layers!! Do you altium?","Unfortunately, yes.\n\nNot that I don't love Altium, but jesus christ when you hit 10,000+ vias and 3,000+ components, you might as well dictate your routing commands to somebody on the phone in India using Allegro who has no idea what they are doing.","Yeah, totally.

So sort of. \n\nI think you'd be surprised how many people need boards like that. Just having DDR3 on a board will push you close to ten layers in nearly every application.  There are a lot of low volume builds out there that aren't terribly cost sensitive, they just need a problem solved.","Dance Dance Revolution 3 was totally the best one.

Really, someone who full combos with all greats gets a higher score than someone with all perfects except one good?","&gt; There are a lot of low volume builds out there that aren't terribly cost sensitive, they just need a problem solved\n\nThis is the kind of job I want.","What… I design boards with DDR3 and have only ever needed 4 layers... granted I do some very cost sensitive high volume design, but you don't need 10 layers just for DDR3. I think what you're trying to convey is that there are many cases where signal integrity is a priority and cost isn't an issue and in those cases you can get 10 layer boards easily for the sake of best case design habits, but you definitely do not need 10 layers just for functional DDR3.","Out of interest, what did you study and do to get where you are now? If you don't mind me asking:)","[deleted]","It's the Bat Server.","how do you feel about people still being petrified of bga parts?","BGAs are the devil's package\n","For amateurs. ","I just finished my first board in Eagle and what is this","Oh man... my company has licenses for Allegro, PADS, Altium, and Expedition, and honestly Altium is the most painful to use of the bunch. Allegro is an absolute dream to use once you have the skill scripts set up the way you want them.\n\nAny time we have 200+ hour designs to do, we pretty much do all of the routing in Allegro and translate it to whatever software the customer wants.","Allegro is definitely the best of there. Now if only Cadence would make the user interface work better. Or really just eliminate the need for animal sacrifice before starting a board. ","How does Altium compare to EAGLE? Also, how long does it take you to do a board like that? It takes me like 4 hours to just to a simple 4 layer board.\nOh man is that a processing power issue or a software issue? ","Comparing Altium and Eagle is like comparing a BMW 7 series to a Kia Rio. Sure the Kia Rio will get you somewhere, but that's all it's got going for it. Meanwhile, in the BMW 7 series you can sit back and relax as your driver takes you around town and then drive it fast yourself when you need to. \n\nRealistically, Eagle sucks. Altium is a good, easy to use (as far as professional EDA software goes) software that is lacking in a very very very serious manner: no UNIX support.\n\nThat last point is the only major problem with Altium. It's like they want to keep shooting their regenerating foot off. If you go to any major design firm, EVERYTHING is in Linux or a form of UNIX. That means Altium is not even considered for EDA software. Not because it doesn't meat the board design needs of the company, but just because it doesn't run on Linux. \n\nAs for a comparison began Eagle and Altium. There really isn't one. Eagle is a piece of junk EDA suite made popular by people that were intimidated by the more serious low-cost EDA software such as KiCAD and GEDA. Altium on the other hand is best in market in terms of ease of use, customer support, and user reviews. Eagle can do up to 4 layers before it starts to shit itself. Altium goes up to n layers where n is the number of layers just before the board designer rage quits their job and becomes a hermit.\n\nI can't really give a ton of specific differences between the two because the difference is basically the difference between a black hole and a bunny rabbit. Sure you can try to compare them, but it's not really going to be useful. ","Altium has a ton of capabilities that EAGLE doesn't have. Altium is far from perfect, but it can do just about any design. In particular, it has very poor performance with larger designs, regardless of how you're treating the planes / pours.\n\nMy company has a handful of designers, and most of our boards fall in the 30 to 120 hour range, but some of the larger ones can be 400+. A handful of those hours will also be changes requested throughout the design process.","I've seen 30+ layers. The majority end up being ground and power planes. This ensures that not only do the signals on different layers not affect one another but also the power. You end up with layer stack-ups like ground, power, ground, signal, ground, power ect. This isn't always the case but it makes high speed routing much easier.","Top layer\n\nPower plane layer\n\nHorizontal traces layer\n\nVertical traces layer\n\nPower plane layer\n\nHorizontal traces layer \n\nVertical traces layer \n\nEtc. \n\nEtc. \n\nEtc. \n\nPower plane layer\n\nBottom layer \n\nAbove is contained the secret to good signal integrity and exponentially increasing costs. Use it wisely padawans. ","Yup, high speed bus design looks a lot like rf black magic. We looked into designing a new backplane for product last year. The instrumentation upgrades were going to cost more than my house.","Back in the days,  we layout graphical design on top layer metal on a vlsi die. If you shine light at certain angle,  you can even see the design.  But then two things happened.  Lawyers,  copyright,  something,  something.  And design rules getting more and more complicated.  Nobody is going to risk a million dollar glorified silk screen (read mask) on the off chance that a sonic the hedgehog's spike is violating an obscure design rule and cause a do over and delay. ","Exactly.  You do it where you can, mostly if it doesn't matter.  My boards get fab in the &lt;1k pieces range.  \n\nI am often the only one that looks at the final design files, other than the manufacturer.\n\nI always have room to spare on one GND layer.\n\nFlying pretty below the radar on this one.","Man, I wish I had thought of this when designing my boards.","I did the same thing with servers for demos.

Of course, the difference between AAVE, the dialect shown, and General American English isn't as big, but the point still stands. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkzVOXKXfQk) is a link with more information on the same concept.","There's a very big difference between a completely district language and this, where English is used as a base, and other, existing English words have their meanings completely changed, seemingly at random.\n\nThis kind of ignorance and lack of education shouldn't be defended. It's a serious problem that needs to be solved. I say the same about U.S. Americans who continue to misspell words and have trouble annunciating properly.","I don't see what's wrong with defending a dialect. In fact, African-American Vernacular has internally consistent annunciating and spelling rules. This means that the dialect is correct. For example, the spelling of color varies depending on dialect: it's color in General American English and colour in British English. Neither is inherently right overall, correctness only depends on which is being spoken or written. The main reason that AAVE isn't seen as legitimate is because people want to enforce General American English. It'd be absurd to enforce ex-pats in the UK to speak British English, so I don't see why people think the same should apply to AAVE. It's very pedantic and backwards to try enforce what language people should speak, because languages don't actually stay the same. Trying to change that is impossible.

Pioneers of the genre include bands such as Possessed, Death, and Morbid Angel.\n\n&gt;This genre often utilizes abrupt changes in tempo, key, and time signature, although this is not present in all forms of this music. Guitars are heavily distorted and down-tuned, and are often played using techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking. Chromatic chord progressions are often featured in Death Metal songs. Death Metal drummers typically play in very fast patterns and often employ double bass drum techniques and the use of blast beats to create a highly aggressive sound.\n\nJust because the genre has a unflattering title doesn't mean the music is anti-peace.","Isn't that just multiplayer? \r\rTo replay the campaign you actually need, well, the story","My college has all their servers named after Greek/Roman gods and demigods.

I thought there was just 2 layers, top and bottom? \n\n","Many years ago, yes, but we've well moved beyond the point where you need more than two layers to route complex circuit boards. So nowadays there are inner layers that you can't directly see from the outside (though they show through the fiberglass layers sometimes).\n\n4-layer boards are very common these days. They usually have one inner layer that is almost entirely ground, and one inner layer that is almost entirely power. This frees you from having to deal with power connections on the outside, so you can use the outer top and bottom layers entirely for signals. As you move up to more complex circuits, you start needing more layers. 6- or 8-layer boards are common whenever there is a larger CPU or System-on-Chip. A typical PC motherboard has 6 to 10 layers. See [this](http://www.gigabyte.com/webpage/16/article_12_ud3_clip_image004.jpg) image from Gigabyte for how one possible layer stackup might look. Different layers can have different copper thicknesses, for different current carrying capability.\n\nLayers are connected with vias, which are little drilled connections that are plated through and make a connection across layers. Vias have also evolved - they used to always go through the entire board (and only connected to the layers that required it), but now we have blind vias, which only go through from one side of the board and stop at given layer, and buried vias, which are entirely contained within the board and connect two (or more) inner layers. You can't see buried vias from the outside.\n\nThe smaller the design, the more layers you need, and the more fancy features are required. The iPhone 4 PCB has 10 layers, the vias are laser-drilled instead of using mechanical drills, and it has blind and buried vias. They need to do this because there is basically no space to route things between components - both sides are packed chock full of parts, so all the routing has to happen on the inside of the board. At that point you're thinking vertically more than horizontally, and the board practically becomes a 3D puzzle.\n\nDesigning complex circuits with fewer layers is an art (and isn't always possible - some chips require a minimum number of layers to route/use, otherwise you just physically can't fit the connections). The more layers you have, and the more fancy features you need (buried/blind vias), the more expensive the board. Consumer products tend to be optimized for lower numbers of layers, to reduce price. Things like servers and networking equipment are less cost sensitive (people *will* pay ridiculous amounts of money for a Cisco), so a lot of the time they just go with massive layer counts as there is no need to optimize, and this lets them have more optimal routing for better signal integrity. The other day I looked at a 10GBit line card for a Cisco ASR router and the board had 22 layers (some boards have the layers numbered on a little guide along the edge, that's how I was able to tell the exact number).","That's just..............WOW! \n\nThanks so much for the explanation, it makes a lot of sense. Are you an electrical engineer by chance? I am studying that at the moment","My degree is in CS, and I'm more of a software/systems engineering guy, but electronics has been a hobby of mine for very long. I don't actually have practical experience routing anything more than a 4-layer board, but I'm always interested in complex systems and the boundary between hardware and software.\n\nIf you're curious about ridiculous layer count boards, you might enjoy [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewz4RAzQTOk) [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHqN6CTOdzA) videos by mikeselectricstuff of an extreme teardown of a SPARC64 CPU module :)","Wow that was awesome. Thanks","As a newly graduated Electrical Engineer who gets to do some board design every once and a while, how and where should I look for jobs that focus more on this skill? I've got some decent experience doing 4 and 6 layer PCB routing using OrCAD, although I've also used Altium in the past back in college a bit. \n\nI'd love to find a job where PCB design is the main focus, but is that a reasonable goal for me, considering I'm just in my first job fresh out of college? ","I'm afraid I'm not really qualified to answer this, as I'm actually in the software field myself (I only did something related to PCB layout professionally once), but what you ask doesn't sound unreasonable. There are many, many companies building hardware who need PCB layout engineers. Pretty much anything that isn't just a rebadged Chinese board, built out of modules, or outsourced, is going to have someone designing the boards. I don't have any specific leads though, sorry.\n\nIf it helps, as an example, I once worked for a small company building irrigation control systems. I wasn't doing PCB layout, but I designed a tool and wrote the firmware/software for it. They had a person specifically doing the schematics/layout, so I actually just sketched out the rough schematic on a piece of paper and handed it to her to make it happen (I could've done the whole thing myself, but they were using Altium which I had no experience with, and it wasn't worth learning it when they already had a person for that). I was only there for a short time, but had I stayed of course I could've gotten more involved with the EDA side of things. There are lots and lots of companies like that, building custom boards for some niche market.\n\nNowadays I'm actually freelancing, and I'm looking forward to getting involved with projects where I can design boards too, but it's probably going to start off with ones that I drive myself as opposed to working directly for clients. Things like building my own tools for the job.","Thanks for your reply. \n\nI'd love to be a board designer for niche stuff. There's just something about PCB routing and placement that allows me to really get in the zone and suddenly it's the end of the day and I feel like I've made progress. Can't ask for anything better than that in a job. But I don't exactly get to design boards all that often. ","I guess part of the issue is that, with smaller companies, you aren't really going to be designing boards all day. You make a product, go through a few test iterations, then it gets released and it's more about the support, firmware, etc. until it's time to make a new product or module. So you probably end up having to do a bit of everything. It's probably only larger companies that end up with people who basically *just* do board design. But if you're also good at things like component sourcing, design for manufacturing, dealing with fabs and vendors, and firmware, that's plenty to make up a full time job. I have a friend who's an excellent board designer who runs a 2-person company doing custom and open hardware and he has lots of stories about how he basically taught himself how to run the entire pipeline, from boards to Chinese vendors to injection moulding to getting books printed.","Yeah, I work in a smaller branch of a company that only has a couple handful of people in the building. I feel as though I'm actually pretty lucky in that regard that I landed my first job out of college in something that gives me a taste of the whole design and testing process. \n\nI'll give you a hint which part I don't like so much: testing and validation. ","Heh, I don't know exactly what kind of validation you mean, but personally I quite enjoy tracking down the odd bug or unexpected behavior. I enjoy reverse engineering, and tracking down weird bugs feels like reverse engineering your own design to see where it isn't doing what you wanted it to do.\n\nFormal validation/testing can be pretty boring, though. I'm more of the guy you call when something unexplainable is happening (more on the software/firmware side, but I also enjoy doing it for hardware), not so much to do formal validation.\n\nIt's good that you got a job that exposes you to more of the whole process though. There's always time to move on to other things as you figure out what is it that you really want to be doing. I had a couple odd/short jobs before finishing college (the one I mentioned above was one of them - got it via a connection to a board member, otherwise it wouldn't have happened), then moved to another country to work for a big multinational (where I'd have loved to find an excuse for a side project involving PCB design, but that didn't happen, though I did find one to work on some low level firmware bringup once), then decided I really wanted to live elsewhere and ended up freelancing. I'm still discovering what path to take but I'm trying to make sure it involves more hardware. I should have something interesting (though probably not money-making) coming up soon writing HDL for a device designed by the aforementioned friend :)","With a EE you're really overqualified to do place-and-route full time. Get something that pays better but still has a component of that. Small shops are the best source of such gigs: you can be jack-of-all-trades. In my area, the avionics places would be where you'd look. YMMV.","Having entire positions dedicated to turning electronic circuits into actual boards is very common in the industry. ","Most companies either have dedicated PCB designers, which is more of a Associates Degree level position, where they do nothing but turn schematics into boards (and maybe do some schematic entry as well), with an EE overseeing the design (choosing a board stackup, layer/route sizes, etc.).   Although when I was an EE, I was contacted as a headhunter that offered a contract position as a PCB designer that would have tripled my pay (as a contractor with no benefits), so it's not an unlucrative career, just you don't have a ton of say in the design, you're just routing what someone else tells you to.\n\nSmaller companies either have the EEs do it themeselves, or outsource the work to a PCB design shop.  But even in those smaller companies, you may be doing PCB design every couple of years as new boards come along, not as a daily task.","I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the routing is automated with a human reviewing and adding a tweak here and there.  Chances are the design rules are pretty straightforward for all but the most exotic signaling, and an algorithm can find a more optimal solution (and maybe even more quickly).","Yeah I figured in companies with more boards being churned out there would be a higher level of automation involved. \n\nI dunno, I guess I'm just trying to figure out what I want out if my job. I'm sure getting a second one in the next year or so will help a lot with that. ","The software to layout boards usually has an 'auto-route' option, but most designers I have talked to say it sucks. It isn't able to take into account vital design considerations like EMI. ","You can absolutely get a job as PCB designer.

This is why I tend to like some motherboard makers over others. Some go for extra layers and tend to have much \"cleaner\" designs. I noticed, they not only have more layers, although not anywhere near 22, but also are more picky with the ICs &amp; power SM stuff and place them in a more organized, pleasing fashion. Some board makers, even if server grade, seem to just BLAM, throw it all on top, everywhere, cluttered.  It's not a real issue but I suppose for me aesthetics mean something. ","Yeah, it's not a certainty, but there is definitely a correlation between aesthetics and design quality. Good layout engineers want to be proud of their work. There are electrical implications too; signal lines have to have matched lengths and the like.\n\nLayer-wise though, meeting the design goals with fewer layers is a greater achievement. More layers makes it easier to have more headroom for better signal integrity, but making it with fewer layers might mean the layout engineer had more experience. Of course, ideally you'd have both a good engineer and some budget to spare :)","&gt;Question, what are those \"layers\" and what do they have?

And if they're doing any extremely high speed, the only options are DX Designer and Allegro. But because Mentor Graphics is so expensive, the only real option is Allegro. Now if only I could get the simulation environment of Allegro with the layout environment of Altium. My life would be perfect. \n\nIf you're interested in trying out professional EDA software, OrCAD, the lite version of Allegro, has a free-to-use version for non-commercial use. And Altium has released CircuitMaker which is essentially a stripped down version of their Alright Designer. Or heck, even try out KiCAD. CERN is developing it to replace the extremely expensive professional EDA suites. It's different from everything else though.  I've seen people layout 10G+ signals with no issues or manual calculations needed in KiCAD by setting the electrical rules properly.

Eagle filled the niche for a cheap/free EDA tool that could be used for simple designs and wasn't completely useless like some of those random PCB layout tools that came and went.\n\nKiCad is good though, especially as of late. Nowadays there is no reason to use Eagle when you have KiCad.

Forward/back annotation was quite poor, the PCB layout side was pretty sad, making component packages was a PITA (you either made them all manually or used *m4* of all things to create parametric packages). I mean, sure, it worked, but it felt like a cobbled together toolchain without much in the way of user friendliness. Not the \"nice to noobs\" kind of user friendliness, but the \"makes you productive\" kind of user friendliness. The user interface can't really be an afterthought for an *EDA* tool; PCBs are inherently graphical. I remember having to sed my way through project files to fix some component ID mess - text based formats at least make that *possible*, but I shouldn't have had to drop down to that level.

If all you're doing is the standard-fare 2-layer run that falls within their free/hobbyist license, sure, go for it.

Histor roughly means educated, wise man and Herodotus was defintely that. ","Ahh thanks ","&gt;Edit: the other days are named after Gods, not other celestial bodies.\n\nWell, kinda sorta.  \n\nThe original 7 Greek *planetes* (things in the sky that move, as opposed to stars which don't) were the Sun and Moon and the planets we now call Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn.  They were identified with seven gods (Helios, Selene, Ares, Hermes, Zeus, Aphrodite, and Cronus), but the reason there's seven of them is because that's how many moving things there are in the night sky.  (The other three or four planets are invisible without a telescope.)\n\nThe Greeks also had a 7-day week - thanks to the Babylonians - and they were the ones who first associated each day with one of the planets.  (Originally, each *hour* of the day was associated with a different planet, in order of apparent orbital time around the Earth; if you do that and look at the name of the same hour on seven consecutive days, you get the modern order of weekdays.)\n\nWhen the Romans conquered the Greeks, they assumed the Greek gods were the same as theirs, just with different names. So they attempted a mapping, and came up with Sol, Luna, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. For the planets, those names stuck through into modern English.  But weekday names took a more roundabout path, probably because the Romans didn't adopt the 7-day week right away; they continued to use their 8-day market system.\n\nThanks to Christianity, the 7-day week eventually caught on across Europe, with one of two naming schemes: simple numbering (in the more religious countries, with \"Lord's Day\" and \"Sabbath\" in place of 1 and 7) or the local mapping of the old Greek god-names.  As English is a Germanic language, we inherited the Germanic version of the latter: Ares became Tiw (Norse Tyr), Hermes became Woden (Norse Odin), Zeus became Thor, and Aphrodite became Frige (Norse Frigg).  Cronus kept his Roman guise of Saturn, while the Sun and Moon kept their common-noun-based names.","French is Lundi and moon is lune","Jamaica Day","Ohh!

","Or they were trying to slip \"redacted\" info past a supervisor they didn't trust.","There are easier ways to do that. Also, it can be traced back to them. Some lawyers have a side business of doing this kind of thing for uninformed clients and charging a fortune for it. 20 min. worth of research on Google will inform anyone on how to do it properly. ","I can't wait to see the redacted part of the redacted part.  ","I realize this is a common practice, but can someone please explain to me how information, requested under the FOIA, is allowed to be redacted? Doesn't it defeat the whole purpose of FOIA?","Sensitive information is exempt.\n\nFOIs would be disastrous if anyone could say, ask the IRS for your SSN and personal information. Or the names and location of every person currently in witness protection in the US.\n\nThose are just hypothetical of course. But an actual one I saw redacted myself was for all documents to do with an ongoing gov't tender. Becuase it would have screwed us over (and the taxpayer) if everyone tendering the offer could see emails where we said \"our budget is X, but we're trying to negotiate down to Y\" - they'd just up their bid to X.","You don't get classified information just by asking for it. That would  defeat the whole purpose of classification.","FOIA has specific exemptions for privacy, national security, etc. These exemptions were written in the original law.\n\nTo put it another way: you can't use FOIA to read my tax returns or the president's medical records. You can't use it to obtain nuclear launch codes. If that sort of information is in a document, it's best to remove that portion of the document - rather than withhold the entire document.","Who gets to decide what's too sensitive and what's not. What's stopping the CIA from just handing them 400 completely black pages and saying \"we blacked out th4 sensitive information \"","Theres nothing stopping them","One of my law school professors used to work for DHS and had to make a FOIA request for a memo she wrote herself. When she sent the request in (to someone who used to work under her), she said \"I need this memo, but I'm guessing you'll probably black out footnote 7, and that's fine, I just need the memo.\"  Months later when she finally got it, sure enough - footnote 7 was blacked out, even though she obviously remembered what the note said.","They didn't necessarily redact the memo to keep information from your proffessor. When you release a physical copy of a document that contains sensitive information it is impossible to guarantee who looks at that document. What if your proffessoror had lost the document, or left it on a desk for unintended eyes?","No, I know. I just thought it was a funny anecdote.","While I'm usually in favor of FOIA requests and transparency in government, there's another side of this that people don't consider. \n\nNo, the Saudis are not our \"allies\" beyond face value, in that they are very good at speaking fairly to us, though ill they mean, to work towards their own benefit. That's what they do best, and it works very well for them.\n\nBut one of the things that having this \"Alliance\" and at least tacitly hiding direct Saudi ties from the public does is that it at least keeps them somewhat willing to only covertly support the islamist groups, reducing their available options, and at least somewhat keeping things disorganized. \n\nIf you make this public, as with a *lot* of the intelligence that is gathered, then you're going to:\n\n1. Galvanize the anti-US parts of the Saudi family and give them ammunition to push to more openly defy and fight against the US.\n2. Galvanize many vocal Islamist groups into backing the anti-US parts of the Saudi family, giving much more power by sheer force of numbers and capability to them, and destabilizing one of the few relatively calm nations in the region. \n3. Give an opening for more fundamental, radical Islamists to seize control in SA, and potentially drive any parts of the Kingdom that do genuinely side with the USA out of positions where they can at least keep the fires to a dull roar. \n\nYes, it's a great coup for the families and for democracy to get the full pile of info and to one-up the government secrecy machine. But in the longer term, the more we expose anyone who even halfway supports an alternative to the fundamentalist Islamists who are very much our enemies, the more power we give to those enemies by virtue of their ability to rally the people to their cause and cause a shift in government. \n\nOne of the absolute worst eventualities we could ever have in the region is if the fundies not only gained control in wider swaths of the region, but if they got enough control with enough powerful people to actually create a unified, well-funded, technologically-advanced state. \n\nThen you wouldn't be fighting \"Terrorism\" as this knee-jerk buzzword used to describe poor, poorly educated brainwashed idiots blowing themselves up and generally being a bush-league rabble for all their ability to coordinate and fight. You would be fighting a state with a much greater ability to raise a real army, with real training and advanced equipment (much of it provided by us to allies in the region). \n\nThen you would be facing a real war with a much, much higher death toll and a much much higher cost than anything we might do in the name of counterterrorism right now. \n\nLooking at this realistically, we can laugh and question the efficacy/necessity of our drone programs and our current half-assed operations because of the absolutely amateur attacks and lack of threat that jihadis pose right now.  \n\nHave them have a chance to solidify and become a single nation with the powers of any of the more 21st-century powers...I don't know that the US has the support, the money, or the will to fight a real, honest-to-goodness war with another nation's organized army. I doubt we'd even be able to react quickly enough or capably enough to prevent something truly horrific from happening.","I agree with the top half, just like many of our actions we are supporting the lesser of two evils at this point. As much as the house of saud sucks, there are worse blocs within it that could use any excuse to upset the royal balance of power in their favor. And even if they failed, we have more than enough evidence around us of the true horror that would be a power vacuum in an oil rich region. \n\nI completely disagree with the second half, we could absolutely wreak havoc on a single organized state with actual violent aims towards us. It's basically our specialty. The rebuilding is where things get tricky.","&gt; it at least keeps them somewhat willing to only covertly support the islamist groups\n\n\"Covertly\" provides them with more oppurtunities to export violence and monarchism to neighboring countries and suppress Arab democracy throughout the region.

And their priority would still be dealing with Iran.\n\n&gt; halfway supports an alternative to the fundamentalist Islamists\n\nFundamentalist Islam is also creation of the monarchy through its state funded mosques, schools, and media. Without continuing to spread ideological education through state funding, it would be extremely hard for the monarchy to remain in power, so they are inextricably linked.\n\n&gt; but if they got enough control with enough powerful people to actually create a unified, well-funded, technologically-advanced state.\n\nThey are getting the money, weapons, technologies, and political power from us already. It's schizophrenic for the US to continue exporting weapons, bombs, censorship\\surveillance tech and continuing to facilitate their foreign interventions. If KSA monarchy is no longer propped up, you would most likely see a shift towards a regime of anti-Iran hardliners emphasizing militaristic \\ nationalist propaganda to justify the introduction of taxes rather than a purely religious outcome.\n\nRelease the pages unredacted and halt weapons exports.\n","The US could easily demolish any non-nuclear nation in a conventional war.  The problem is fighting asymmetric wars (guerillas, insurgencies, terror cells), and stabilizing and rebuilding.\n\nTake Iraq for example, the Iraqi army was defeated in a few months with hardly any US casualties.

If they become antagonistic towards us, the flood gates of one of the largest, richest and most influential middle eastern nations will open in support of those extremist organizations who have declared war on the west. \n\nYou have to realize that the economy and oil prices MASSIVELY effect our elections as well. So much so, that if the economy is good and oil prices are low then the incumbent party is shockingly more likely to retain control, while if there huge economic issues or oil price instability or huge foreign policy crisis, the parties are likely to switch.

[Here's the full transcript](http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/disinfo/alibis/whitehouse_cheney.html):\n&gt;MR. RUSSERT: What's the most important decision you think he made during the course of the day?\n\n&gt;VICE PRES. CHENEY: **Well, the--I suppose the toughest decision was this question of whether or not we would intercept incoming commercial aircraft.**\n\n&gt;MR. RUSSERT: **And you decided?**\n\n&gt;VICE PRES. CHENEY: **We decided to do it. We'd, in effect, put a flying combat air patrol up over the city; F-16s with an AWACS, which is an airborne radar system, and tanker support so they could stay up a long time. It doesn't do any good to put up a combat air patrol if you don't give them instructions to act, if, in fact, they feel it's appropriate.**\n\n&gt;MR. RUSSERT: **So if the United States government became aware that a hijacked commercial airline was destined for the White House or the Capitol, we would take the plane down?**\n\n&gt;VICE PRES. CHENEY: **Yes. The president made the decision, on my recommendation as well, wholeheartedly conquered in the decision he made, that if the plane would not divert, if they wouldn't pay any attention to instructions to move away from the city, as a last resort, our pilots were authorized to take them out.** Now, people say, you know, that's a horrendous decision to make. Well, it is. You've got an airplane full of American citizens, civilians, captured by hostages, captured by terrorists, headed and are you going to, in fact, shoot it down, obviously, and kill all those Americans on board? And you have to ask yourself, \"If we had had combat air patrol up over New York and we'd had the opportunity to take out the two aircraft that hit the World Trade Center, would we have been justified in doing that?\" I think absolutely we would have. Now, it turned out we did not have to execute on that authorization. But there were some--a few moments when we thought we might, when planes were incoming and we didn't know whether or not they were a problem aircraft until they'd diverted and gone elsewhere and been able to resolve it.\n\n&gt;MR. RUSSERT: And that will be the policy of the United States in the future?\n\n&gt;VICE PRES. CHENEY: Well, the president will, I'm sure, make a decision, if those circumstances arise again. It's a presidential-level decision, and the president made, I think, exactly the right call in this case, to say, \"I wished we'd had combat air patrol up over New York.\"\n\nSo Cheney was pretty clear that he did NOT shoot down that airplane. He merely said that we scrambled jets to fly over DC (which absolutely did happen).","https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7vV3fjfeb9Q \n\nMaybe he misspoke twice then.","Let's say that they shot down the plane and lied about it. So what?\n\nWhat does that change?","I wouldn't blame them for a second it was the right thing to do, sadly. But it changes the truth. ","More importantly, when you watch the entire interview, it's clear that he did NOT shoot down that plane. \n\n[He said he would have given the order to shoot it down had it been necessary.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/feds-would-have-shot-down-pa-jet/)","You got me.

It had been Deputy Secretary of State Rich Armitage,** who told the Justice Department that he had leaked the information to Novak, but kept what he had done from the White House. **Armitage would later admit that he had even earlier told journalist Bob Woodward about Wilson’s wife’s employment.

It's a success in terms of getting him to admit to the crime in some degree. But at the same time, it's sad.\" \n\n&gt;The commission's former general counsel, Dan Marcus, now an American University law professor, separately expressed surprise at how little the Justice Department told the commission about Berger and said it was **\"a little unnerving\" to learn from the congressional report exactly what Berger reviewed at the Archives and what he admitted to the FBI -- including that he removed and cut up three copies of a classified memo.**\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/20/AR2007022001344.html\n\n\nYes genius, this all happened so the Clinton administration could cover the Bush administration's ties to Saudi, keep telling yourself that. \n\nOr maybe open your eyes and drop that partisan blindness and realize who is really fucking the American people.","I always went with the Jew conspiracy, but this works too I guess.

That will leave the US military well-staged to invade Syria and Iran, setup the Turkish Stream pipeline, and threaten Russia economically.\n\nIf the Saudi Arabian government makes sufficient reforms, maybe - just maybe - it will be politically feasible for Russia to step in to defend them, as with Syria.\n\n(What worries me is that the whole \"blame Saudi Arabia for 9/11\" thing may actually be a ruse *with the consent of Saudi Arabia* to provide cover for moving massive numbers of US troops and weapons to the staging area. If Saudi Arabia is in on the game, then Russia's only counter-move (as I see it) would be an uninvited, preemptive invasion of Saudi Arabia, making Russia the aggressor and potentially incurring international rebuke -- certainly portrayed as \"Russian aggression\" in the western media anyhow.)\n\nConsider.... what will the Muslim world's reaction be when the Great Satan invades and destroys Mecca, which is in Saudi Arabia?

Most of the things people are pissed off about (smart people, at least) happened before he took office. He's just an establishment guy trying to do his thing, and that means keeping the secrets of the previous decision makers.","President Obama appears to have no personal agenda other than securing his families' position in elite status. He is merely a speech giver and charismatic person. He does the tasks that others tell him from behind closed curtains.\n\nThe general public has no clue.","Would Deep Throat count as a whistle-blower?

They aren't for the the people, when they actually might be for the people, they get killed.","Maybe it's just because of the rise of the Internet that this has been more of a concern for governments now. If you want something heard you can release it to the public and the whole world can see it the day it's blown. ","That's a terrible analogy. Before the nineties, there were no \"whistleblowers\" - just traitors. The whistleblowers we do have are more inclined to come forward, because the threats that used to exist to balance the scales, to,give them reason to believe their actions were justified have grown distant and small. So there are more people coming forward, leaking documents and dissenting. And they are able to with less and less brutal repercussions. Yes, there are still reprisals and prosecutions, but it's hardly surprising. \n\nIf Obama *were* to take the steps necessary to safeguard people coming forward, he'd get crucified by senate and congressional intelligence &amp; security committees. He'd be pilloried by the Republicans and it would be used as political propaganda to attack him, and every other Democrat seat. So, of course he doesn't. Whatever he believes, he simply is not able to make those kinds of moves. Just look at how hard it has been for him to shut down Gitmo. He really wanted to do that, but others have blocked him at every turn. The President is not all powerful in the ways some seem to imagine. \n\nThe government is a collection of people, and most of those people are mostly good, because that's how people are. Some might be cynical, or deluded, but a lot of them simply disagree with *you* about how things should be. And maybe they're right, and maybe they aren't. But change of this nature, structural, societal, takes a LONG time, and it has to start somewhere, and it has to be protected and encouraged. It takes decades or more for those kinds of changes to occur, and the one thing that helps nothing is unchecked cynicism. ","\"We don't do the right thing because it's too hard.\" Okay then, pack it up everybody.","First of all, I think you're point is really well made and I agree with most of what you're saying.

I also said (in a kind of a dopey, reductive way) that his administration is fielding leaks and allegations that have nothing to do with his policy. He really is the sap who happens to be president while this change is going on, and he is very limited in what he can do.\n\nYou're apparently arguing that there is *nothing* more he could do. That's wrong because Liam Neeson has a whole speech at the end of Schindler's List about how even he coulda done a *little* better. I'm not qualified to argue exactly what he could have done differently, but I have every reason to think that the democratization of information wasn't as high up on his list of priorities as I would have liked, and as a voter and tax-payer, I get to complain about it.\n\nSo here's what I don't understand and I think you do: is our new, whistleblowy environment the result of Obama policy, or is it just part of the natural advancement of information technology? Should Obama get credit for some advancement in the democratization of information, or has he just kind of towed the line?\n","Yep.

Because I don't. I want equality of opportunity, and freedom, not equality of wealth and outcomes. Equality of wealth promotes laziness and stifles innovation.","To an extent, yes, I do.  Wages have been stifled for decades and while the average CEO makes something like 5 times what he did a few decades ago, the average worker makes nearly the same (less, if you account for inflation).

Likewise, RT and Sputnik News will be the first to play up revelations about mass surveillance, because it sows discord in the United States and between the U.S. and its allies.\n\nYet, as much as they are keen to do that, that doesn't lessen the veracity or outrageousness of any of those things.

They didn't. Or they thought the benefits outweighed the cost.\n\nI have one reservation about the Mitrokhin Files: they were copied from the Russian archives by hand and the \"authoritative\" book which was released was ghostwritten by the official historian of MI5. \n\nAs such they would have been in a position to insert, distort or withhold anything they so desired. It represents an excellent opportunity for a smear job against political dissidents.\n\nHere is a CIA memo from 1967. I quote an excerpt.\n\n&gt;  PSYCH\n\n&gt; **1. Our Concern. From the day of President Kennedy's assassination on, there has been speculation about the responsibility for his murder.** Although this was stemmed for a time by the Warren Commission report (which appeared at the end of September 1964), various writers have now had time to scan the Commission's published report and documents for new pretexts for questioning, and there has been a new wave of books and articles criticizing the Commission's findings. In most cases the critics have speculated as to the existence of some kind of conspiracy, and often they have implied that the Commission itself was involved. **Presumably as a result of the increasing challenge to the Warren Commission's Report, a public opinion poll recently indicated that 46% of the American public did not think that Oswald acted alone, while more than half of those polled thought that the Commission had left some questions unresolved.** Doubtless polls abroad would show similar, or possibly more adverse, results.\n\n&gt; **2. This trend of opinion is a matter of concern to the U.S. government, including our organization.** The members of the Warren Commission were naturally chosen for their integrity, experience, and prominence. They represented both major parties, and they and their staff were deliberately drawn from all sections of the country. **Just because of the standing of the Commissioners, efforts to impugn their rectitude and wisdom tend to cast doubt on the whole leadership of American society.** Moreover, **there seems to be an increasing tendency to hint that President Johnson himself, as the one person who might be said to have benefited, was in some way responsible for the assassination.** Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American government. Our organization itself is directly involved: among other facts, we contributed information to the investigation. **Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this dispatch is to provide material for countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such claims in other countries. Background information is supplied in a classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments.**\n\n&gt; **3. Action. We do not recommend that discussion of the assassination question be initiated where it is not already taking place. Where discussion is active, however, addressees are requested:**\n\n(...)\n\n&gt; **b. To employ propaganda assets to answer and refute the attacks of the critics.** Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. The unclassified attachments to this guidance should provide useful background material for passage to assets. **Our play should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (i) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in, (ii) politically interested, (iii) financially interested, (iv) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or (v) infatuated with their own theories.** In the course of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful strategy may be to single out Epstein's theory for attack, using the attached Fletcher Knebel article and Spectator piece for background. **(Although Mark Lane's book is much less convincing than Epstein's and comes off badly where contested by knowledgeable critics, it is also much more difficult to answer as a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of unrelated details.)**\n\nhttp://www.namebase.org/foia/jfk01.html\n\nPerhaps I should mention, about the CIA's glowing review of the \"impeccable integrity\" of the Warren Commission as seen above, that LBJ blackmailed a ***crying*** Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren to head the commission and subsequently bragged about it. The same LBJ mentioned in fear in the CIA memo above as speculation about his involvement became more widespread. RFK and Jackie Kennedy both suspected him, too. The reasons behind all this are too complex to get into here.\n\n&gt; **This fascinating conversation between President Johnson and his old mentor Senator Richard Russell is very revealing. Johnson begins by reading to Russell the announcement of the formation of the President's Commission to study the assassination, to which he has named Russell. Not realizing that it's a done deal, Russell complains that he \"couldn't serve on it with Chief Justice Warren--I don't like that man\" and pleads with Johnson to reconsider. LBJ tells him that \"Dick, it's already been announced and you can serve with anybody for the good of America, and this is a question that has a good many more ramifications than on the surface and we've got to take this out of the arena where they're testifying that Khruschev and Castro did this and did that and kicking us into a war that can kill 40 million Americans in an hour.\"**\n\n&gt; **Toward the end of the conversation, Johnson re-invokes the image of 40 million Americans killed in a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union, and then tells Russell how he got Warren to serve on the Commission. After Warren refused several times, Johnson called him to the Oval Office and told him \"what Hoover told me about a little incident in Mexico City,\" whereupon Warren began crying and told Johnson \"well I won't turn you down, I'll just do whatever you say.\"**\n\nhttp://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/lbjlib/phone_calls/Nov_1963/audio/LBJ-Russell_11-29-63_2nd.htm\n","700 Billion in treasuries won't hurt us.

George Bush authorized Leo Wanta, George Soros, Gerald Corrigan, Alan Greenspan, and others to destabilize the ruble and facilitate the theft of the Soviet/Russian treasury with the help of rogue KGB agents.  The West backed 4 Russian oligarchs and had them takeover the prized Russian and CIS industrial assets in oil, metals and defense. This was done by financing and managing the money-laundering for the Russian oligarchs through the Bank of New York, AEB and Riggs Bank. \n\nThere is way more to the story, but the purpose of the \"economic war\"  launched the collapse the Soviet economy and began the western takeover of it’s key assets.

I've easily worked with over 100 students from countries like Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Ireland, Macedonia, you name it. Western or Eastern Europe. \n\nNow, nearly everytime these kids come over, they always get so excited as to how much they get paid (starting $9 an hour). Like they want to work 6 to 7 days a week, as many hours as we can possibly provide. Many of them, specifically from Eastern Europe, always say \"I make more than my parents do\" (unless their parents are doctors or dentists). Some work in factories and don't even have stability of work every week. Some of these kids stay in America illegally and send money back home to support their families.\n\nMy point is, people come *here* to work GLOBALLY. They don't go to Germany. They don't go to Denmark. They come here to work their asses off, save money for themselves or their families, and even stay here. Because this country is fucking awesome in wages comparatively. \n\nIs it perfect? No. But I think this site consistently nails it down without considering the global perspective.","America! You have to be from another country to appreciate the benefits!^TM","Ironically, sorta kinda! There's a reason why the world wants to come here to work.","Yep how ironic is that, IMMIGRANTS  tend to do very well here with all the new found possibilities, while we say they're the reason we're unimaginative and have very little motivation...","Well, think about it. If we had lower standards like the immigrants we wouldn't be Americans and we'd have a country like theirs that reflects it.","Except people do go to other countries. Germany for example is #2. \n\nAmerica isn't the best at work-life balance. Sure we attract people for the American Dream, and sure a lot of foreigners have it better off here, but remember we are fallible and could do better. ","And we're #1. So there's that.","lol.\n\nOf course we are-- we were a world superpower with high quality of life and freedoms that made everyone envious of us for nearly 60 years.\n\nWe also have a pretty shitty attitude about work and government and religion so there's that.","I disagree on work attitude. I think working hard and accomplishing things is important. I think if I had lived in Germany, I would have accomplished far less in significantly more time because of the difference in attitudes about work. I take pride in the work I do, and because I am young I am willing to work a lot and accomplish a lot before I end up finally settling down. \n\nAs for government, I think our government is oft-maligned despite doing a very good job. Every government failure seems to be magnified as a failure that should never happen and every success seems to be minimized as something that should have happened a long time ago, when the exact opposite is true for businesses. Failures by small businesses go unnoticed, because no one ever knew they existed, but successes are trumpeted as proof that businesses work better than government. Our government has saved millions of lives through disaster relief efforts abroad, programs like PEPFAR, peacekeeping efforts etc. Our government has given support to the sciences that continue to keep US universities as the best in the world and keep the US as the world's best research hub. Our government has done a lot of good, but sadly people ignore it.\n\nAs for religion, can't disagree.","I'll probably have to maintain my disagreement. After working in the states and then two other countries, I've seen very dedicated and hard-working coworkers, but at the same time there's more caring on the part of the employer.\n\nBoth my previous job and my current one enable me to save lives and do good for our entire world. I am accomplishing a lot of my goals in life but it doesn't come with the same poor attitude. I just can't really see myself working stateside where we don't have statutory maternity leave, paid sick time, mandated vacation, full universal healthcare and a general concern for workers' rights.\n\nI used to work with the federal government, and trust me, there is a lot of great things it does. I am a strong federalist and I believe that we need to do more for our people. It's really hard, honestly, because no country is perfect but we obviously see more flaws manifested in the ones we've lived in our entire lives.\n\nI had a great university education but our k-12 is falling behind in a lot of ways. The more interesting thing to note is that in the western countries I've lived in I haven't seen as much dichotomy in poverty levels and income. I want us to be better but we need to face the facts that we aren't #1 at everything.","Agreed on K-12. Maternity leave, PTO, and vacation days are all taken care of in California and in other states. Worker's rights is vague as hell. The NLRB handles a lot of abuses relatively well. The ACA will eventually get us to 100% coverage as it is a universal compulsory insurance program. Expect to see medicaid expansion in some states and an expansion of subsidies to fill the medicaid gap if Clinton is elected. While I would prefer single-payer, when all of ACA rolls in by 2020, and the provisions that have been rolled out have time to do some work, cost growth will begin to resemble that of Europe, if not be lower due to our high starting point.\n\nK-12 is fucked, admittedly and I really don't know what the solution is.","I'm confused, Germany has a higher minimum wage plus perks like healthcare and education. I know a lot of poor countries have been sold the idea of America (the Phillippines has especially) but that doesn't make it best for them, and immigrants settle everywhere. Yes, people go to Denmark globally too, people move around a lot. Again I'm confused by your comment, it seems ironically circlejerky.","You get a higher minimum because you get a 45% income tax to pay for your education and healthcare. ","I am not going to comment on Germany's tax system as I know nothing about it, but it certainly isn't true in the UK (which is a rich European country and an immigrant hotspot - both from Eastern Europe and from the US and other rich countries).\n\nYou don't even pay any income tax unless you're earning over £11k, and then it's 20% of anything between £11k and £40k, then 40% from £40k to £150k, 45% of anything above that \n\n20% sales tax too. You will definitely be paying to study at a university (whether directly or through the student loan system), same as anyone who lives in the UK except Scotland\n\nIn the US you'd be paying taxes, tuition fees and health insurance premiums, so the gap isn't that big - and at least you don't have to worry about having adequate healthcare coverage in the UK","Sure, on anything earned after $280,000 a year. So that's definitely up in the 1%. I'm not German (btw), but this is pretty basic stuff.","&gt; They don't go to Germany.\n\nUmm, yes they do. Even AMERICANS do.","&gt;Look I'm not saying it's perfect here, but I think this is the most ignorant circlejerk on Reddit.\n\nBut youre saying the same thing?","I think the reason why wages look good here is our low taxes. In all of the other wealthy countries you named, taxes are much higher.\n\nFor example: in the US you make $10 an hour and are taxed 33% of you income. Let's say that in Germany you make $13/hr and are taxed 50% of your income.\n\nWhich one pays better? The US job because $6.66 after taxes is better than $6.50.\n\nI don't think that the US has \"fucking awesome wages\" compared to most other developed countries. I do think that we tax people considerably less which makes it appealing for people who want to work here and send money home.","&gt; My point is, people come here to work GLOBALLY. They don't go to Germany. They don't go to Denmark. They come here to work their asses off, save money for themselves or their families, and even stay here.

Ireland is itself one of the rich European countries of course. No visas needed due to freedom of movement. Plus going home to see their parents is a 1 hour plane ride rather than an 8+ hour expedition.\n\nAnd our minimum wage is more than $9 an hour.","You are overlooking the exchange rate. I dont know to what degree it affects wage comparison but i would bet its a pretty substantial reason why some foreigners go to the US. Especially if the send back most of the money they earn. ","Your examples are poor. If they are making $9 an hour, no wonder they want to work as many days as possible: they don't have a choice. Also, those people can't possibly afford health insurance or college on that kind of money, or buy a house. The cost of college in the US has been going up at several times the rate of inflation for decades. Housing has become incredibly expensive. Health care is incredibly expensive.","Doctors come here from around the world to work here. People want to come because there's so much opportunity in America that isn't there in many countries.

It doesn't matter if you personally have the coverage or not, but you are paying for other people who do. Whether you're covered for something you'll never use is irrelevant.\n\n&gt; You think it's a great thing people are paying for things which, mathematically speaking, have 0% chance of occurring.\n\nDefinitely. I think it's great that people with genetic disorders can pay for treatment they need to stay alive or live a meaningful life.

","Are you suggesting that the expense of health insurance plans (premiums vs. coverages) would have gone up to the same degree even if the ACA was not passed?

The market there went from the self-employed to self-employed plus the unhealthy who lost old coverage, so the risk in that segment became pretty obscene for insurers. I'm really glad that I stopped freelancing around the same time. Since most people don't know the actual rates on their group plans thanks to corporate benefits, it makes sense that the sticker shock of that would create the most attention.","That's interesting because I was self-employed before and after the ACA passed, and indeed, the premiums went up, but not by a surprising amount.","\"employer sponsored\"\n\nBTW what happened to deductibles?

And both have an explanation as to why, even though in reality we don't even agree on the facts and certainly don't have the depth of understanding to draw conclusions even if we did.\n\nIt reminds me of the infamous town-hall meetings before the ACA.

Any invasion would unite the Islamic world against the US.\n\nSecond, Saudi Arabia is the key backer of the petrol-dollar. The petrol-dollar helps keep the US dollar strong and maintain its value on the global markets. A strong US dollar encourages foreign investors to buy US treasuries and bonds. This allows the US government to maintain its debt and spending level. \n\nThird, the Saudis invests tens of billions of dollars on US industries, in particular oil and defense.

That being said, it'd also goes both ways, meaning victim's families of every drone strike under the Obama admin can sue the US, as they perceive that as terrorism.  it just sets a horrible precedent that can't be reversed. ","I think that would be a **great** precedent. A little thing called justice.","i essentially agree with you, but I imagine there would be sort of a domino effect that would have negative connotations in the US in terms of an economic fallout which would affect citizens that had nothing to do with any sort of terrorism or drone strike or what have you.

","Could you elaborate on how you think it would affect citizens? Curious to hear your thoughts. ","well, i'm no economist by any means, so I'm spitballing here, but: \n\nif the US throws the Saudis under the bus, they'll dump their bonds which would be a huge blow to the Fed, which would probably make them print more money to ease the pain. From there, other countries follow the lead of the Saudis and dump their US debt as well, causing the US $ to spiral.  More bonds being dumped = more money being printed = more inflation. cost of living goes up and up. corporations realise it's too much to do biz in the states, so they start pulling out. jobs are lost, employment benefits start being cut, etc. Stocks would likely drop, and in the process, start wiping out retirement funds and pensions and some would be left with nothing.  I'm probably completely wrong, so you can downvote me into oblivion, I don't really care. It's not like these things would happen over night, it'd be rather gradual as the grandstanding and pissing contests go on and on.

They would sell their bonds, which would be purchased, but not at the same price as today. However, they would have to move their money into another asset (not USD). So that asset would be sold by other investors, who could in theory buy US bonds at their cheaper prices. So, although it would have an effect, it would not be the end of the world. ","genuine question: if the money was moved to another currency, wouldn't that entice other entities to drop the dollar as well? And why would people buy up the US bonds knowing they could very well turn into junk? To me, personally, it just doesn't seem like  smart move. ","Only if the Saudis selling meant that the US government would be unable to pay back the debt (without inflating the currency). As long as everyone else in the world still believes they will be paid back their investment, they won't sell. I don't believe the Saudis have that much influence. Also, the US could always cut spending or raise taxes to offset some of the effect of less buying of the debt, which would give confidence back to the market. My opinion anyways.","How about we allow the people to be sued personally, not the government itself? ","You're right - our masters are only acting in our best interests.

AM DOG","You have to imagine the glass to be totally invisible for a dog. We sort of already know there is glass because we know how doors work, and we know how houses work, we know the purpose of a door, or glass. And a dogs vision is worse than us. Imagine there is suddenly an 100% invisible force field on the street. Basically like 'under the dome'. Just there, without any reason. After running into it a few times you will just assume it's there. And if something suddenly passes you would first walk very carefully to make sure it hasn't moved a few meters (because why not, you would know nothing of this force field)","[removed]","Is there 1 more stair?

He bolted out the front door and put his foot right where the plank should have been. He went face first into concrete....","I agree sort of with what you're saying, but I definitely think dogs can still see both glass and screen doors when they try.  Their vision isn't really so bad that things are just invisible to them.  After running into it a few times, my dog definitely can just see when either the glass door or screen door is closed now, without trying to touch for it or even before he gets near.  It's proved to me because he slows his charge way early when approaching closed glass/screen, and simply whisks straight through it when they're both open.  Only occasionally in weird lighting would he stop to double check but lots of people including myself are just as guilty with screens.. .\n\nI think some dogs are just more or less apt to change their methods of testing for it. Mine adopted checking the way humans do while some dogs just insist on relying on the original primal cues, like pawing for it or seeing a person \"animating\" it open.  Even if a dog is stuck in his old ways I'm still like 99% sure you could train him out of it pretty quickly if you wanted, unless you enjoy watching him be a bonehead.","I think its maybe an old dog because of the hair coloring around his face.

That's cold.","[removed]","Do dogs understand object permanence?","Yes. The glass is invisible to them, though. Imagine closing your eyes and wandering around your house. You know the layout, but then you find open space where you expected a wall to be. You would have a vague idea that the wall is still there and somewhere close. You'd probably exhibit behavior similar to the dog in OP's gif.","Wait, why is glass invisible to dogs? Can't they see smudges/reflections?","Animals with eyes closer to the ground tend to have poorer vision and animals with eyes further from the ground tend to have better vision.","So bigger animals have better vision than small animals?","Taller, not bigger. Birds are the exception.","So giraffes must have eyes like binoculars.","Well, there's other factors. Animals that climb trees, like humans and monkeys, have better vision than animals that don't.  Humans and other primates also stand upright.  Birds have to have good enough vision to clearly see the ground while flying so they tend to have very good vision, even tiny birds, although the ones that soar very high up like hawks, eagles and vultures probably have better vision than birds like hummingbirds which stay very close to the ground.  Insects tend to have very poor detail vision but it's very specialized to defense and avoidance of threats and can often see motion at a decent distance.  \n\nAlso there are probably animals that buck the trend entirely.  The evolutionary pressure that makes vision more important with a raised perspective is not absolute.  I can't think of an example because I don't really study biology or animals.","I love how similar that is to any human trying to navigate their house in the complete dark","Or drunk\n\n\nOr drunk in the dark","Drunk in the bark","I'm so proud of this dog","He conquered his fears of the invisible wall for bacon!","&gt;for beggin\n\nFTFY","[Source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-KhOAgPlQ4)","*ya gonna come?*\n\n","phrasing!","No, /r/SexWithDogs","Theres your risky click of the day.

Between March 21st and September 21st, the South Pole becomes tilted away from the Sun (the \"polar night\"), allowing lower temperatures to cool in the Antarctic stratosphere. As a result, by late May, thin polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) form. At the edge of the ozone hole, near the polar vortex boundary, warmer temperatures lead to fewer PSCs and the associated ozone loss is not as severe.

","That would be because Auckland is a rainforest, they just chopped all the bush down and built overpriced substandard housing all over it.","NZ varies a*lot*.\n\nThe southern coasts of the south island are cold, windy and rainy. The central regions of that same island can be intolerably hot and dry in the summer and then bone-chillingly cold in winter.\n\nAs you head further north, it becomes much more temperate and humid, although the central North Island has the same extremes of temperature that the South Island does.\n\n\nCompared to Norway though? I would say we are generally warmer. Snow is not persistent except on the highest of alpine mountains. I believe there aren't too many arid parts of Norway, but NZ definitely can feel as hot as Australia sometimes. But overall, I would say a Norwegian wouldn't feel to shocked by our climate.","The central north island doesn't get anywhere near the south for cold. \n\nWhen does the north have a week long average of -4c? ","About 35c max in summer. About -10c minimum in winter. ","European living on the southern end of NZ.\n\nThe summer is similar to a summer in Denmark and southern Norway/Sweden.\n\nThe winter is much warmer than in northern Europe. More like a winter in northern Italy or France. We have a few snow days and I have never seen snow laying longer than a day. So for skying you need to get on top of a mountain.\n\nEdit: This is for the southern end. The north is similar to Spain / Italy summer and winter. Feels more humid though but maybe I imagine that.","The southern coast of the South Island is one of the closest land masses to Antarctica. ","You'll probably find New Zealand to be super comfortable. Temperature wise, the worst that the South Island gets to is around -10C and the North Island will barely dip below 0C.\n\nHowever, the wind can be very, very cold. It's predominately southerlies straight from Antarctica, so the wind chill factor can make some South Island winter days very cold indeed.","Went swimming there one summer when I was a kid (this lake or one near it I can't quite remember), and it's like a bloody ice bath","You can swim in it - it's just bloody cold.","It's near freezing.

I would rather have a bunch of dumb teenagers fucking around on birth control than a bunch of kids that have limited access. It makes a huge difference. ","Why are you arguing for contraceptive availability. That's not part of my argument. My argument is that even if every woman was on contraceptives she still chose to have sex, she still chose to gamble her womb.","\"Gamble her womb\"?\n\nSo you subscribe to the theory that a baby is punishment for the woman daring to have sex? Do you then also subscribe to the theory that that baby deserves some kind of support from the same government that forced its existence, or should it just live its life unwanted or in poverty?\n\nOr, rather more simply, do you just believe that sex is evil and the woman deserves to be punished for having it?","Why are you okay with abortion in the case of rape? Is it because it wasn't the woman's \"fault\"? Are you filtering your opinion of abortion through the lens of whether or not the woman was at \"fault\" for getting pregnant? Do you care about the life of the baby at all?","Why are you quoting the word \"fault?\" Women have agency, they're intelligent people with the ability to make decisions based on consequences. If a woman gets pregnant after consenting to sex then yes she is at \"fault\" for getting pregnant. \n\nIf she said \"no\" but got raped then she never consented to the fetus being there in the first place and thus has the right to take away consent from the fetus. \n\nOr, more probably, if she knew the man was using a condom but if he took it off without her knowledge and bust inside her then she is not consenting to the pregnancy. But only if she doesn't notice. If she does notice he did then it is her responsibility to take the morning after pill, etc.\n\nI'm basically bridging together the rights of the host with the responsibility of the host. Trust me, I'm not taking this stance based on feelings but rather straight logic. Life is secondary. (And btw, a zygote is alive and is a person and is a human).\n\nIf you can convince me that a woman never consented to the pregnancy while still consenting to a potential pregnancy then I **will** change my stance. I used to be wholly pro-choice because I'm a libertarian but my world view evolved.\n\nEDIT: I'll reply to your other comment here. Yes, a woman gambles every time she consents to sex and if she gets pregnant then she has to live with the consequences. At least until she gives birth. The fetus didn't choose to be conceived so it's not its fault don't blame the baby. The woman can give it up for adoption and the government will take care of it. As is the case today. If you ask any single person today if they would rather die or live in poverty you would see that people are glad they're alive or they'd commit suicide. ","&gt; If a woman gets pregnant after consenting to sex then yes she is at \"fault\" for getting pregnant.\n\nFault. n. \"responsibility for an **accident or misfortune.**\" (emphasis mine)\n\nThis implies that the act of getting pregnant is either an accident or a misfortune. Why do you consider \"getting pregnant\" to be an accident or misfortune only for the woman? Do you not consider the man partially responsible for this accident or misfortune?\n\n&gt; If she said \"no\" but got raped then she never consented to the fetus being there in the first place and thus has the right to take away consent from the fetus.\n\nWhy? Is all life sacred, full stop? If so, why allow the woman to terminate the baby? If not, then why not allow the woman to terminate the baby in other situations?\n\n&gt; Or, more probably, if she knew the man was using a condom but if he took it off without her knowledge and bust inside her then she is not consenting to the pregnancy. But only if she doesn't notice. If she does notice he did then it is her responsibility to take the morning after pill, etc.\n\nSo what if she did notice that the man had deceptively finished inside of her but was too poor to afford the morning-after pill at that time? Should only rich people have sex?\n\n&gt;(And btw, a zygote is alive and is a person and is a human).\n\nThat is extremely debatable. A zygote is a parasite. It cannot sustain life outside of its protective womb, and feeds off of the nutrients in the blood of the mother. Without that direct blood transfusion, the zygote dies. Is it a human? Yes. But it is also a parasite until it's capable of living without that direct transfusion.\n\n&gt; Yes, a woman gambles every time she consents to sex and if she gets pregnant then she has to live with the consequences.\n\nSo sex is a sin and pregnancy is the punishment? Is that what you're saying?\n\n&gt; The woman can give it up for adoption and the government will take care of it. As is the case today.\n\nSo you would put the woman through a grueling, possibly life threatening, and expensive procedure (birth) just to have the unwanted baby taken away and put into the hands of the government? What kind of libertarian are you? You're advocating for a massive expansion of government in order to handle the welfare of all of these babies.","Alabama?\n","Well.

Plus, I would think that gun ownership rates would be lower in the cities. In any case, I think we would ride out the zombie apocalypse just fine here in the US :P","yeah looking at some statistics i am surprised by how few large population centers the US has. only two, really. new York and Los Angeles could sustain that size of militia and with all the guns owned by people and gun stores can likely arm that many too. a handful might manage 300-500 thousand. the rest can likely only manage about 100 thousand or less. but there is a lot of cities so combining militia's could bring about very large state militia's.\n\nnot a lot of countries can mobilize so much so fast. it's definitely an advantage when defending the country, all tho it has not been necessary. ","&gt; new York and Los Angeles could sustain that size of militia\n\nThat's like 30% of everyone living in NYC, though (also half or more of LA's population). It's just not feasible, even if you handed them all guns. They just wouldn't know how to use them properly. Maybe a few thousand at best for the biggest cities. The rest would have to flee as refugees. Gun culture in the cities is a far cry from rural or even suburban America. If it came to it, several states might be able to raise something around a million or so.\n\nIn less urban areas, however, I would expect to see a higher percentage of people owning their own guns and being able to use those guns effectively.","traditionally, militia are armed peasants. doesn't have to be military age males, its a militia not a professional army. im pretty confident they could amass than many guns, and enough ammo for everyone to have a little bit. in an event of a large scale conventional war you can bet your ass more than a few thousand militia would come from new york. \n\nif new york was unable to be evacuated and faced extermination, they would just arm everyone with whatever they can effectively forming a probably about 4 million man strong militia. wont do you any good against armor but armor does not hold cities, infantry does. and you would need a full size army to take on 4 million, even much less than that. even if they are very ineffective, as militia frequently are, that's just too many armed people potentially all over the place for anyone to really seriously consider a manned invasion of the country.\n\nthe reality is, of course, that professional army's are way more effective, the US one is so effective i don't think any nation would actually be able to get troops into the US in any significant number, and certainly not with armor. best option is to land in canada or mexico and work the way up or down from there, but by the time they get there, there will be tens of millions of militia prepared with some basic training and some basic armor/weaponry. that's if the US feels their professional army wouldn't be able to to the job.i personally think that in any situation possible today, the US army could do the job without having to directly involve the populace. ","&gt; traditionally, militia are armed peasants\n\nYeah, but you won't really find them at all in cities.\n\n&gt; im pretty confident they could amass than many guns, and enough ammo for everyone to have a little bit\n\nYeah, and then what?

I don't think so. I live in Upstate NY and I would say that guns are far more prominent here. Realistically, the military would set up blockades *and* evacuate the city as quickly as possible in order to avoid the risk of targeting American citizens (we're gonna assume this is an invasion by sea or paratroopers or whatever). That help from other states would be from the armed forces, not militia groups.\n\n&gt; 4 million man strong militia\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. You expect every other NYer to pick up a gun and fight? They're gonna be leaving so the army can do their job. I would hope that every American would allow the better-equipped US army to do its job regardless of whether they [individual citizens] have the capacity to fight on their own or not. It's not a matter of cowardice or anything (and you never said anything of the sort, but I just feel like expanding here), it's just that the army should be able to do its job effectively without worrying that it's bombing its own citizens. Would come in handy against that armor, too.\n\n&gt; that's just too many armed people potentially all over the place for anyone to really seriously consider a manned invasion of the country\n\nYeah, you're absolutely right. I've seen so many foreigners joke about America having two armies (the armed forces and every gun owner, lol), but America seems to be unique in that sense. I could see armed militias filling in the gaps for the army if it was getting overwhelmed, but that would require (in a non-nuclear attack) a massive global alliance to even get there.\n\n&gt; the reality is, of course, that professional army's are way more effective\n\nYeah, exactly. If someone tried getting in through Canada or Mexico, we wouldn't stand by. Both nations are among our top trading partners and are US allies.

You have a list of everybody with an registered gun.\n\nPass a bill prohibiting civilians of owning guns. And say that anyone in the list of registered gun owner, that doesn't go and give their guns back to the government (with some kind of cash compensation) will be issue a warrant for their arrest 2 years after the bill has been passed.\n\nThis will obviously not be a popular law... but most gun owners are law abiding citizens that will complain about the law but will nevertheless obey it.\n\nAnd to make things more efficient (about disarming the populace), you increase the punishment for owning a [unregistered] gun, and say that anyone, while in those 2 years, that have a unregistered gun and give them up, will not suffer any penalties. So some people who currently owns a unregistered gun will prefer to give them up as well.","And that is how you get a revolution kids.\n\nIf you think that plan would go anywhere close to smoothly you clearly do not know many American gun owners.

When time ends... Police will fulfill the warrant... Most of them again, will not start shooting police officers for just doing their jobs.

However you propose passing a bill calling them criminals for owning firearms. Guns are a huge part of American culture and the right to bear them is enshrined in the Constitution. \n\nYou think you can just tell a group of people they are criminals and disarm them? People are already skeptical of the government, and you want to take away their rights and demand they give their firearms to the government? It will never happen. There are already right-wing militias in place who actively want a fight with the government and your proposal to criminalize firearms would radicalize even more people. This country was founded on overthrowing tyranny.\n\n&gt; Only a minority of a minority will actually try to violently held onto their guns... these people will be put in jail.\n\nNo, it would end in a complete fucking bloodbath.

Stop grandstanding. Your timeframe doesn't exactly line up with the existence of guns or of the United States but it's a good point regardless of how poorly you made it.

Most developed nations' prison system don't have a recidivism rate of 50-80% over 1-5 years, for instance. Yet do we adopt a different system? No, because just as with the weapons industry, the prison system is privatized and those companies are not interested in improving the system and lowering their profit margins. Our mass shooting death per capita rate is actually not #1 in the world, but it's still high, and there are other countries that we can look to in an attempt to lower it.

I'm neutral on chemtrails because they don't exist (and if they were effective, nobody would care, would they?), I'm pro-GMO because they provide a cheaper, more productive, more resistant food source in an era of increasingly difficult food production and lacking space, and global warming is, undeniably, true.","I like you too ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","r/HailBigPharma","Well... if your decision negatively impacts the lives of other children around you...","How is it hypocritical to want to both keep your guns and use tax dollars to fund relief for natural disasters?

Maybe when my kids are older I will get them but the fact is, they give a lot more now, and in a different manner than when I was a kid, and it is literally impossible to know the future effects because they haven't been doing it long enough to know, no amount of science can see the future.","She's right.

She knows.","I don't believe this occurred at all.","Being pro 2nd amendment is a liberal stance.  The right to bear arms is a liberty, liberals by definition are for individual liberty.","By definition, liberal is \"open to new behavior or opinions and willing to discard traditional values\". Whereas conservativism is not willing to discard traditional values. \n\nWhat this means varies from country to country. In the US, this means the social conservative opposes gay marriage, but is pro-gun-rights. Whereas the liberal is open to challenging either or both of these values. \n\nThe liberal-conservative divide, thus, has nothing to do with individual liberty, and more to do with the willingness to challenge traditional viewpoints. There isn't really a coherent philosophy or beliefs that unites either groups, it's more of what-is and what-isn't regarded as traditional values.\n\nSome liberals, for example, may want to push tolerance towards all religions. Other liberals may however believe that religion is the problem and that we should value reason and science, dismissing religion as supersititoin. Meanwhile the social conservative may believe that Christianity is the traditional value of the country and we should strive to preserve that. \n\nMost people have a mix of conservative and liberal viewpoints, but may lean towards one side more than another, based on their overall willingness to challenge traditional values.  ","Yeah dude is confusing liberalism with libertarianism. ","No, you all are confusing liberalism with progressivism.  Only in the US does \"liberal\" mean what Americans have perverted it to mean.","I don't think so. I think progressivism is a belief that change is necessary. That's different from how /u/Romaine603 has characterized liberalism. ","I think he pretty clearly characterized it as progressive.  Each example he gave was a \"change\"","He states that liberalism is an openness to change. This is not the same, though it may overlap with, believing change to be necessary. ","But it isn't. Liberals are generally open to change, when juxtaposed to conservatives, which are by definition resistant to change, but that's just incidental and is not the core of the philosophy.\n\nThe etymology is the biggest clue here.\n\nhttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=Liberal","The traditional definition of \"liberal\" as referring to liberal politics and the liberal arts refers to the study and exercise of being a free person.\n\nClassic liberalism, and the liberal arts, very much espouse individual freedom.","American liberalism strays from classical liberalism, which promotes the rights of the individual such as those guaranteed by the 2nd amendment. ","If only that were actually true. ","The democratic party has plenty of non-liberal (authoritarian) views.

Which btw...that point made by the other guy...Disney is not \"forgetting the prequels.\" \n\nThey still sell prequel merchandise and promote the old films a bit in collections. Also Disney is just currently leaning on the OT because many of the stories in the new films are directly influenced by that era (Sequel trilogy/Rogue One/anthologies).\n\nI'm holding onto a Clone Wars SWBF2 until official word says otherwise!","I would love a clone wars era battlefront. \n\nI respond every time someone says this in the hopes that someone influential may take pity on me and actually make this game. ","It was a remake. I agree it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been and DICE definitely isn't it's old self as proven by Mirrors Edge Catalyst, but it's fun to pick up and play a match or two when you're bored. Yeah it's a bit shallow and basic but it captures the feeling of Star Wars and it's great fun, and that's all I need from it.\n\nThe connection issues suck though.","It was absolutely not a remake and please don't ever call it that. The original had *significantly* more maps. The original allowed for *significantly* larger battles. The original had a campaign, galactic conquest and space battles. The original had *significantly* more vehicles. The original had 6 classes.\n\nThe \"remake\" has ~~well~~ under 75% *less* content. That's my estimate being very generous. ~~It's probably more like 90% less~~. It doesn't remind me of the original games at all. It just has the words \"Star Wars\" on it.\n\nThere is no excuse for this. It is 2016. If anything, there should me *more* content.\n\nEDIT: the math was done!","I apologize. I meant Reboot. It is a reboot. I think your estimate is a little off though. Battlefront 1 has 16 exclusive maps and ~24 including the ones also in Battlefront 2. DICEs Battlefront has 15 maps in the base game +4 more in the paid DLC. Even if you don't pay a dime after the base game purchase, there's still more free maps and content patched in every other month or so. Unless I'm doing math wrong that means the new battlefront only has 76% of the content of the original. And we're not even getting into the absolute beauty of the game itself compared to the original, heck, it makes games that came out *last year* look only decent graphics-wise.","76% is pretty close to my nice estimate, I changed my comment accordingly! That's still pretty bad though :(\n\nBut A+ for the graphics, Dice. You really have to appreciate that one. Ever see the mods for it though? It's difficult to tell what is a picture and what is the game with some mods run through a 4K (or higher) PC.","I agree. The graphics were one of the main selling points for me. Just Gorgeous.","Puhleaze, prequels for all its flaws were superior because of Lucas who actually has an original voice.\n\nYes jar jar sucked.\n\nBut I believe it was unfairly criticized. The prequels got crap for green screen which led to wooden acting and compared to OT but Lucas is the founder of ILM so of course it makes sense he's going to push it to its limits and now we see may films with heavy use of green screen and cg so it was ahead of its time and a pioneer. Also, there were more practical sets and models used and if you compared the percentage TFA used and PT, the difference will be negligible. Lucas was getting back into the director's chair after more than a decade away, cut him some slack and the movies got better as it went on especially with episode three which stands right behind episode six. And I think there was a case of the fanboys knowing too much about how the sausage was made in the OT regarding its origin eg certain discarded ideas which led to denigrating of Lucas' ability when any good story will have been rewritten and contributed to, but Lucas as director then producer had the most responsibility for its quality.  The highly regarded Clone Wars had Lucas as consultant to the writers.\n\nThe OT gave us so many inarguably awesome things, Darth Maul, the Duel of Fates, Obi Wan who they now wanting to make a movie on, the Jedi Council, a thought-provoking commentary on a republic turning into a totalitarian government which is all the more relevant now, a moving arc for Anakin that leads perfectly into the OT, the duel on the volcano, expanding the world.\n\nI hated TFA because it slavishly ripped off entire moments from the OT, when it wasn't ripping it off it was leaning on it too much, and when it wasn't leaning too much it was giving us weak storytelling and directing. Yes TFA did have some good points in a sea of bad but it's fatal and unforgivable error was being a copy.","Neither, I'm just saying J.J. Abrams is not a George Lucas.","Come on, Lucas didn't get lucky he worked hard and made something great","Nah, did you hear? The effects and the editing are why that movie is great... seriously, somebody said that.

The way this shook out last year is Merc ended up with their series 4 engine and all of their customers were left with series 2 or 3 engines. Ergo, the engine manufacturers currently control everything today. The race for the P1-4 is between Mercedes and Ferrari right now. It's still not really a race, Ferrari has a lot of catching up to do. \n\nIn terms of difference between the teams, the chassis and engine combination design is where the formula sings. In regards to your original question, there can absolutely be differences between the teams, so long as their conform to the rules for constructing. The front wing is a great example of difference. Haas is basically the American Ferrari B team, and a Ferrari customer for power, they've been fiddling with the design their front wing (aerodynamics) so far this season. \n\nAll of that is specific to formula 1, but since you just said \"formula\" in your comment, I feel compelled to add some info about spec formulas like FormulaFord or FormulaRenault. They are spec built cars, meaning all the cars on the grid are the same, to really showcase driver ability, rather than constructor's design. ","This is old. Like 2013 old.

But still, it's interesting that they're following the same line, regardless of whether it's due to driver ability or slip stream suckage. But you're right, it might not be that it's the fastest line, just an effect of a slip stream. Does anyone know more about slip streams?\n\nEdit: yes I know drivers actively try to utilise a slip stream. But I reckon to an extent the car is drawn into a slip stream as well. No? Also, a slip stream allows cars to drive more efficiently, not faster, as they would crash into the car in front if they went faster.","It's not an \"effect of the slip stream\" that somehow funnels him into the same path, it is because the driver behind does his best to stay right behind the car in front since that means he has less air resistance and thus can drive faster than the guy in front of him.\n\nIt is something drivers actively try to do, not something that just happens because of physics.","This interests me, I know it's a thing in nascar with the generally car shaped cars, but in f1 following too close messes with the areo on the front wing, it's why drs is so important to overtake in f1, so in indycar with the different aero setups for the different types of courses I wonder how following close effects the car","The issue with f1 cars following each other is through corners. Down a straight they draft like anything else. When they get to the corner though, they have less grip than the guy in front. Any car that relies heavily on aero for grip is going to experience this effect. Indycar is a little less sensitive than an f1 car. They get more downforce from the floor, and overall just have less downforce. ","Thanks, answers my questions","&gt;f1 following too close messes with the areo on the front wing\n\nIt messes with the aero in the corners which is why it is a negative but on a straight you still get the 'tow' from the car in front.\n\nThat is why when they overtake on a straight the overtaken car will pull back in immediately behind the car that overtook them to try and get a bit of a boost and if really lucky make a move.","Thanks I'll have to keep an eye out for that during the upcoming Russian gp","Then I would buy a flying car if I won the lottery.

The metals are welded on top of each other, drawn out and folded back over itself. You do that enough and you end up with a pattern like this, albeit not visible. The etching of the knife in the Ferric Chloride brings out the pattern by etching one metal. So after it being in the Ferric Chloride for a couple minutes, you end up with this pattern. ","Thanks for the explanation! ","Anytime ","It is a really interesting process. The first couple minutes of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k7KjLyD9so) video do a great job of explaining it.","Is this purely for aesthetic purposes or does this have practical benefits?\n\nEdit : [should have read further down](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/4g6ad4/pattern_welded_damascus_steel_dipped_in_ferric/d2ezhke)","If I buy a cool pocket knife from Cabelas and then buy some ferric chloride and dip it, can I get the same pattern?","No, factory knifes are stamped out of plate steel and ground to shape then quenched&amp;tempered ","If the knife was made by the process of folding layers of  different Steel then yes.

Modern attempts to duplicate the metal have not been entirely successful due to differences in raw materials and manufacturing techniques. Several individuals in modern times have claimed that they have rediscovered the methods by which the original Damascus steel was produced.[5][6]\n\nAlso the knife in the gif doesnt look as fine/detailed as [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/Watered_pattern_on_sword_blade1.Iran.JPG)","I'm trying to figure out what the knife is made of too","After the dip it looks like damascus steel knives in csgo ","CS:GO knives looks like this.
