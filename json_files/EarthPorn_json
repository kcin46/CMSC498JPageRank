The planets don't rotate at the other point, they rotate around two points, with the sun being at one point and an empty point near it, due to the sun not containing 100% of the mass of the system.","You're telling us the earth does not revolve around the sun? ","Imagine two suns rotating together. It's not so that one of the suns is rotating the other, they're actually rotating around a common gravitational point in the middle of them. \n\nNow imagine one of the suns is a planet. Same applies, but the common point is probably still at the center of the sun, but not exactly at the center. ","Right, the earth essentially orbits around the sun because the center of mass of the system is so close to the sun. The sun is so massive compared to the Earth that the Earth's mass can be effectively ignored (a one-body problem).

Histor roughly means educated, wise man and Herodotus was defintely that. ","Ahh thanks ","&gt;Edit: the other days are named after Gods, not other celestial bodies.\n\nWell, kinda sorta.  \n\nThe original 7 Greek *planetes* (things in the sky that move, as opposed to stars which don't) were the Sun and Moon and the planets we now call Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn.  They were identified with seven gods (Helios, Selene, Ares, Hermes, Zeus, Aphrodite, and Cronus), but the reason there's seven of them is because that's how many moving things there are in the night sky.  (The other three or four planets are invisible without a telescope.)\n\nThe Greeks also had a 7-day week - thanks to the Babylonians - and they were the ones who first associated each day with one of the planets.  (Originally, each *hour* of the day was associated with a different planet, in order of apparent orbital time around the Earth; if you do that and look at the name of the same hour on seven consecutive days, you get the modern order of weekdays.)\n\nWhen the Romans conquered the Greeks, they assumed the Greek gods were the same as theirs, just with different names. So they attempted a mapping, and came up with Sol, Luna, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. For the planets, those names stuck through into modern English.  But weekday names took a more roundabout path, probably because the Romans didn't adopt the 7-day week right away; they continued to use their 8-day market system.\n\nThanks to Christianity, the 7-day week eventually caught on across Europe, with one of two naming schemes: simple numbering (in the more religious countries, with \"Lord's Day\" and \"Sabbath\" in place of 1 and 7) or the local mapping of the old Greek god-names.  As English is a Germanic language, we inherited the Germanic version of the latter: Ares became Tiw (Norse Tyr), Hermes became Woden (Norse Odin), Zeus became Thor, and Aphrodite became Frige (Norse Frigg).  Cronus kept his Roman guise of Saturn, while the Sun and Moon kept their common-noun-based names.","French is Lundi and moon is lune","Jamaica Day","Ohh!

[It has a yearly cycle of activity](http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/25TOMSAGU.html):\n\n&gt;Each year, the Antarctic \"ozone hole,\" a dramatic thinning of ozone, begins opening in July and shrinking in November. Between March 21st and September 21st, the South Pole becomes tilted away from the Sun (the \"polar night\"), allowing lower temperatures to cool in the Antarctic stratosphere. As a result, by late May, thin polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) form. At the edge of the ozone hole, near the polar vortex boundary, warmer temperatures lead to fewer PSCs and the associated ozone loss is not as severe.

I've got this silly routine where I must swim a minimum of 5K a week, so I brought my wetsuit.\n\nThe water was painfully cold - like the kind of cold that makes the bones in your face hurt.  Normally, I warmup when I swim, but in this water, I'd get colder and colder.  I could only go about 30 minutes at a time.\n\nBut I'm from Texas, and we're kinda pussies when it comes to cold water.  There were little kids playing in the water like it was a bathtub.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tXEaX0m","It's cold enough in that lake that if anyone drowns often the body never comes up - cold enough to prevent decomposition and the gases it generates from the floating the body to the surface.","That's pretty metal.\n\nGlad I didn't know that while I was swimming.","Quote from the chief executive of the Lakes District Council:\n\n&gt; The water temperatures in Lake Wakatipu can be refreshing for a summer dip but lethal all-year-round for anyone trying to survive more than a few minutes.","I live in the Pacific Northwest. What is warm water?","Jesus what a pussy, and that was the warmest month of the year too.\n\nI guess growing up in the South Island we get used to the cold. ","When I was a kid I used to do the same but now there is no way I'm going for a swim here in anything but summer. Why are kids so much more resistant to cold?!","I applaud your being from Texas and yet speaking, on the international communication network, in the International System of Units.\n","Awesome!  We're slowly adjusting.  Most of our lap pools are 25 meters, so we tend to think of swimming in terms of the metric system.","That's heartening.\n\nI don't know how you managed to swim in Lake Wakatipu, given its temperature, even with a wetty. I can recall having a hard time wading through a few South Island rivers. \n\nIncidentally my silliness requires me to do 3K a week - in the pool.","You can but it would be cold as fuck any time of the year","How is the climate compared to Norway? I never expected any part of NZ to be cold. I thought it was summer all year long down there.","bahah, compared to Norway it probably is summer all year long :P. \n\n\n\"Crisp\" is the best word I could use to describe it. It doesn't get humid like east coast Australia, but can certainly be warm. The sun is dangerous given the hole in the ozone layer. Winter there is not snow everywhere, but it's definitely noticeably colder than Sydney for instance. \n\n\nGenerally speaking the South Island is colder than the North. \n\n\n ","It doesn't get humid? I moved to Auckland his summer and fuck me, it's like living in a rainforest","I second this observation","Auckland is at the other end of the country.    Otago is not humid.  The driest part of the country is just over a range of mountains from this photo. ","Well yes I realise that, I've spent a lot of time in central. But we're talking about climate and NZ as a whole. I was questioning the 'it doesn't get humid like east coast Australia' part. ","That would be because Auckland is a rainforest, they just chopped all the bush down and built overpriced substandard housing all over it.","NZ varies a*lot*.\n\nThe southern coasts of the south island are cold, windy and rainy. The central regions of that same island can be intolerably hot and dry in the summer and then bone-chillingly cold in winter.\n\nAs you head further north, it becomes much more temperate and humid, although the central North Island has the same extremes of temperature that the South Island does.\n\n\nCompared to Norway though? I would say we are generally warmer. Snow is not persistent except on the highest of alpine mountains. I believe there aren't too many arid parts of Norway, but NZ definitely can feel as hot as Australia sometimes. But overall, I would say a Norwegian wouldn't feel to shocked by our climate.","The central north island doesn't get anywhere near the south for cold. \n\nWhen does the north have a week long average of -4c? ","About 35c max in summer. About -10c minimum in winter. ","European living on the southern end of NZ.\n\nThe summer is similar to a summer in Denmark and southern Norway/Sweden.\n\nThe winter is much warmer than in northern Europe. More like a winter in northern Italy or France. We have a few snow days and I have never seen snow laying longer than a day. So for skying you need to get on top of a mountain.\n\nEdit: This is for the southern end. The north is similar to Spain / Italy summer and winter. Feels more humid though but maybe I imagine that.","The southern coast of the South Island is one of the closest land masses to Antarctica. ","You'll probably find New Zealand to be super comfortable. Temperature wise, the worst that the South Island gets to is around -10C and the North Island will barely dip below 0C.\n\nHowever, the wind can be very, very cold. It's predominately southerlies straight from Antarctica, so the wind chill factor can make some South Island winter days very cold indeed.","Went swimming there one summer when I was a kid (this lake or one near it I can't quite remember), and it's like a bloody ice bath","You can swim in it - it's just bloody cold.","It's near freezing. These lakes are thus color because they are glacier fed. ","The Aussies drew the short straw with that, nothing here is dangerous or even poisonous for that matter.

However, even pictures can't capture the magnitude of the hills and mountains in that country, it's just incredible.","As much as we love tourists in NZ, some travelers do fuck it up for the rest. I went for a spot of fishing up by Mt Cook and some tourists just dumped a bunch of rubbish on the side of the road. ","People who do that are so arrogant and disrespectful.

And everywhere north of Auckland is quite stunning, too.","Ah ok, ya we're going to visit lots of places in the North since we are on a geological field trip. I just wished I could stay some days extra lol.","It's a great place to visit for geological reasons as it's quite \"young\".

I mean I'm a woman so....\n\n\nAnd I actually still think Carrie fisher looks like Carrie fisher. George Lucas looks like a completely different person.

I'd much prefer if the next Battlefront was based on the new trilogy.","The new trilogy hasn't much more to offer than the OT does. Except for updated skins and Kylo Ren/Rey as heroes. Until the movies flesh it out (with new ships/guns/characters) they should do the clone wars era. Which btw...that point made by the other guy...Disney is not \"forgetting the prequels.\" \n\nThey still sell prequel merchandise and promote the old films a bit in collections. Also Disney is just currently leaning on the OT because many of the stories in the new films are directly influenced by that era (Sequel trilogy/Rogue One/anthologies).\n\nI'm holding onto a Clone Wars SWBF2 until official word says otherwise!","I would love a clone wars era battlefront. \n\nI respond every time someone says this in the hopes that someone influential may take pity on me and actually make this game. ","It was a remake. I agree it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been and DICE definitely isn't it's old self as proven by Mirrors Edge Catalyst, but it's fun to pick up and play a match or two when you're bored. Yeah it's a bit shallow and basic but it captures the feeling of Star Wars and it's great fun, and that's all I need from it.\n\nThe connection issues suck though.","It was absolutely not a remake and please don't ever call it that. The original had *significantly* more maps. The original allowed for *significantly* larger battles. The original had a campaign, galactic conquest and space battles. The original had *significantly* more vehicles. The original had 6 classes.\n\nThe \"remake\" has ~~well~~ under 75% *less* content. That's my estimate being very generous. ~~It's probably more like 90% less~~. It doesn't remind me of the original games at all. It just has the words \"Star Wars\" on it.\n\nThere is no excuse for this. It is 2016. If anything, there should me *more* content.\n\nEDIT: the math was done!","I apologize. I meant Reboot. It is a reboot. I think your estimate is a little off though. Battlefront 1 has 16 exclusive maps and ~24 including the ones also in Battlefront 2. DICEs Battlefront has 15 maps in the base game +4 more in the paid DLC. Even if you don't pay a dime after the base game purchase, there's still more free maps and content patched in every other month or so. Unless I'm doing math wrong that means the new battlefront only has 76% of the content of the original. And we're not even getting into the absolute beauty of the game itself compared to the original, heck, it makes games that came out *last year* look only decent graphics-wise.","76% is pretty close to my nice estimate, I changed my comment accordingly! That's still pretty bad though :(\n\nBut A+ for the graphics, Dice. You really have to appreciate that one. Ever see the mods for it though? It's difficult to tell what is a picture and what is the game with some mods run through a 4K (or higher) PC.","I agree. The graphics were one of the main selling points for me. Just Gorgeous.","Puhleaze, prequels for all its flaws were superior because of Lucas who actually has an original voice.\n\nYes jar jar sucked.\n\nBut I believe it was unfairly criticized. The prequels got crap for green screen which led to wooden acting and compared to OT but Lucas is the founder of ILM so of course it makes sense he's going to push it to its limits and now we see may films with heavy use of green screen and cg so it was ahead of its time and a pioneer. Also, there were more practical sets and models used and if you compared the percentage TFA used and PT, the difference will be negligible. Lucas was getting back into the director's chair after more than a decade away, cut him some slack and the movies got better as it went on especially with episode three which stands right behind episode six. And I think there was a case of the fanboys knowing too much about how the sausage was made in the OT regarding its origin eg certain discarded ideas which led to denigrating of Lucas' ability when any good story will have been rewritten and contributed to, but Lucas as director then producer had the most responsibility for its quality.  The highly regarded Clone Wars had Lucas as consultant to the writers.\n\nThe OT gave us so many inarguably awesome things, Darth Maul, the Duel of Fates, Obi Wan who they now wanting to make a movie on, the Jedi Council, a thought-provoking commentary on a republic turning into a totalitarian government which is all the more relevant now, a moving arc for Anakin that leads perfectly into the OT, the duel on the volcano, expanding the world.\n\nI hated TFA because it slavishly ripped off entire moments from the OT, when it wasn't ripping it off it was leaning on it too much, and when it wasn't leaning too much it was giving us weak storytelling and directing. Yes TFA did have some good points in a sea of bad but it's fatal and unforgivable error was being a copy.","Neither, I'm just saying J.J. Abrams is not a George Lucas.","Come on, Lucas didn't get lucky he worked hard and made something great","Nah, did you hear? The effects and the editing are why that movie is great... seriously, somebody said that. Can't we just admit that he was a talented director once and just lost his vision 30 years later, instead of making up ways to give all the merit to other people?
