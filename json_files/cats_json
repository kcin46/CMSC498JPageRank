Even In a crosswind, the front and rear landing gear should touch as simultaneously as possible for the most control on the ground. Now, often landing in a cross wind, you often land tilted so one side (left or right depending on direction of wind) will touch the ground before the other but front and back should be the time. \n\nTldr: this is actually not how you're suppose to land in a crosswind.

Generating realistic photos and/or video.\n\nYou can mess with realtime physics in blender but you won't have all that nice simulated lighting you have herd","Oh cool. I know that the point of everything here is for it to look good so good lighting's important, I might mess around with ugly physics.","If you want realize that falls under the government of video game engines. When working with 3d assets utilizing blender, cinema4d, 3dsmax (the list goes on and on) the physics must be simulated and rendered. Simulation is exactly what you think, the process of calculating dynamics (using math none of us would ever want to do) and rendering is the calculation of light, materials, camera placement, motion and much more to determine what color pixel x of millions is (almost 1 million for one frame @ 1280x720.\nThe reason why it's not real time is its all done with the cpu. Video games utilize engines that preload and cache shaders, have already done the necessary calculations and have preset algorithms in place so that they can utilize a gpu to handle everything. Physics are still done on the cpu but video game physics aren't as accurate as fully simmed physics so they're less taxing. \nHope that helps...\n","It does, but what if you had physics with no shaders? Just gross black and white or random colors?","It still has to calculate geometry, you could have 1:1 perfect simmed physics of say for instance 2d particles, which is where plugins like x-particles and other point based physics systems come in.\nAs long as there is geometry and complex dynamics, the OP posted the non-rendered software display which doesn't look bad but it's not pretty. ","Simulation time refers to calculating the physics in one go and cache the simulation result to my RAM or Harddisk.

How did you learn about blender and how to use it? 2. What hardware is best to render something like your simulation? Thanks","Learning a program like Blender is kinda like trying to learn a game like World of Warcraft, except you start at level 100 and there wasn't a tutorial.\n\nYou have to strip it down to the basics and take it in bite sized pieces like how the interface works, how to manipulate objects in 3D space, etc.\n\nThe best way to do this is to simply set yourself small incremental goals and use Blender a lot. Watch tutorials and copy them. [This is a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHVYYMG3QVY); in the lower left corner it shows which hotkeys he uses and can give you a good idea of what features and keys get used most for moving objects and the camera around.\n\nWhen you get stuck try finding more specific info or tutorials about that issue, sometimes if you're **really** stuck, looking up the methods behind a feature can help, for example what does rigid body actually mean? what does convex hull collision mean?\n\nThe good news though, computer simulations are better-suited to work with very simple 3D models. Minimalistic designs can still be very good looking.\n\nAs for rendering, I used Blender's Cycles renderer which allows ray-tracing to be done on my graphics card. nVidia was the fastest at rendering and supported the most render features for a while but I hear AMD is catching up. Although rendering on your CPU isn't the end of the world if it's relatively new and high-end.\n\nMaking a render look *nice* is actually a skill-set itself separate from how technically good your render is(just look at the original Toy Story). Looking at references like how professionals light products or general real life lighting tutorials can mesh well with learning how lights work and look good inside a 3D program.\n\nLearning something new will always be frustrating but eventually the payoff will outweigh the pain. Hope this was helpful. :D","Thanks man really appreciate the reply will try this out.","\"Learning a program like Blender is kinda like trying to learn a game like World of Warcraft, except you start at level 100 and there wasn't a tutorial.\"\nI was a java web application programmer before I retired, which is probably one of, if not the most complicated system to learn.

","You should bring in a feather toy or a ball of yarn and see if it distracts her.","Here's the thing about her: she's never actually owned a cat.","Oh gosh. Sounds like some deep-seated childhood issue. Parents said she could never have a cat, but that was okay. After all, the neighbor's cat, Mister Jingle Mitts, would always come over and play with her. But, one day he stopped showing up and the neighbors said Mister Jingle Mitts disappeared (as cats do). So she asked her parents again, but of course they said \"No,  we're sorry sweetheart, but daddy's allergic. We can never get a kitty.\" So she pretended to have an imaginary pet kitty and as she grew up.... she became that kitty.  ","No one is turning themselves into a goddamn cat with my money!","That's literally every fandom","Literally any and all fandoms have weirdos. I love Wreck it Ralph, but I know there is so much Ralph/Vanelope porn. I love Rooster Teeth but I know there are plenty of Gav/Barb ships. I've even seen sexy weeping angels out of the Dr Who fandom. ","I like RT too, seeing how much they look at rule 34, they should have a demo disc looking at rule 34 of rt","It's a good show? I mean, I guess it's well drawn. It's for kids, though. ","It's a good show, but you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it. It can be enjoyed by all ages. ","My wife watched every single episode of Phineas and Ferb and the episodes I saw with her were fantastic. I don't think something being made mainly for children makes it bad for adults. Some shows are just super fun for all ages. If Phineas and Ferb is great for an adult, why not MLP?","Normally a show for kids is made simple, has simple plots and simple characters. It differs from show to show, but most of them are like that. ","Most *bad* kids shows are like that. Good ones have characters that work on two levels, one where they're amazingly stereotypical, and one where they're really fleshed out and have long running motivations that you can read into if you pay attention. \n\nBut really, it seems like every show with multiple writers and a decently sized cast does that. Star Trek almost always had a big enough cast that some characters are just around to fulfill their stereotype and then get out of the way of a story. Kirk runs into an injured life form, waves over McCoy, who scans it with the tricorder, frowns, says something, Kirk doesn't get it, Spock gets it and makes a comment, Kirk keeps looking confused, McCoy explains better, Kirk understands, asks if McCoy can do anything, \"Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a _\" and then Kirk runs off to shoot/punch/screw somebody/thing. \n\nThere, I just described roughly a quarter of the original series. I could do the same with Ponies (to a lesser extent as the series went on), but I could do the same with House (\"It's never lupus\"), or any of a ton of other formulaic shows like that. The characters take their turns developing behind their stereotypes, but the stereotypes don't change much. That's just the nature of most TV, and even the shows which attempt to avoid that kind of slice-of-life-ness seem about evenly split between older and younger audiences. \n\nEdit: I guess the full sequence actually has Spock explain what McCoy said, and then Kirk goes \"but what does that have to do with _?\", and then McCoy drops the bombshell plot twist, and then Kirk asks if McCoy can do anything..., or there's a commercial break. ","You mean literally every fanbase ever that has more than just 12 year old kids in it?","Oh shit, when I was the editor of our literary magazine we had a brony submit fanfic, too. His wasn't about pony sex, though, it was the introduction to an entire book he had written about some kind of pony war. ","The same goes with fans of anything. Harry Potter, Doctor Who, Anime, MLP, Star Trek, even Hockey or Football. As long as you don't go overboard, it's chill.","Also, I don't think you should make a big deal you watch it. No one is really interested, :/","I used to be pretty into it. I have some shirts and other merch, and I even went to a con once. I kinda fell out of it, but I can still honestly say I like the show,  even if I mainly watch it with my 4 year old sister now. ","I would like to go to a bronycon. How was it? ","It was fun. It was DerpyCon, in New Orleans. It was really small, but there were a lot of cool people there and the cosplays were pretty neat. There wasn't much in the way of panels or anything, but the artists tables were awesome. ","That sounds really cool, thanks for sharing","I had a classmate who openly admitted to jerking off to MLP.","That's definitely a healthy sexual fantasy with no concerning underlying psychological issues.","/r/clopclop","yep","nope, that's why they have the free time and numbers to DV you\n\n**TRUMP 2016**","what?"],["Oh jesus christ, I've done this.
