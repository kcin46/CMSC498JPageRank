One of the key features of the adaptive immune system is the ability to distinguish 'self' from 'foreign'. This property is key to fighting off pathogenic invaders. And in Type I diabetes, the idea is that the adaptive immune system is \"confused\" and \"thinks\" that certain proteins/carbohydrates expressed by cells in the pancreas are from foreign pathogens. So it destroys them.\n\nThe major advance of this paper is that it finds another commonly \"confusing\" protein that often triggers the adaptive immune system to attack the pancreatic cells. This will by no means be the last such molecule identified by researchers. And it by no means provides a complete picture of the areas the immune system attacks in Type I diabetes.\n\nThe whole \"five major auto-antigen\" narrative in the article is also a bit laughable. I can think of plenty of auto-antigens not named by the authors, such as: heat shock protein, islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein, PDX1, chromogranin A and more.\n\nCool research. Has potential therapeutic implications. Terrible title.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people lamenting how breakthrough research never lives up to the hype. I look at it like this: If Reddit was around in the 1920's there would have been a post, *Canadian researcher isolate small peptide from pancreas of dogs; use it to cure diabetes*.\n\nSince that was the foundation of insulin therapy, I say keep swinging for the fences. The nice thing about breakthroughs is that it just takes one good one to really shake everything up.","As someone with an incurrable illness, SirT6's edit has it right. It might not seem exciting to you, but people like me are just excited that any research is being done. There's research right now trying to link Crohn's to MAP bacteria, and while one outcome of that study could lead to new treatments it's really just more exciting that anyone is working on the problem at all.","Same boat.  Diagnosed Ulcerative Colitis last June.  On my third gastro now who isn't convinced it's not really Crohn's.  Just how little does the scientific community know about auto-immune diseases?  Genetic keeps coming up which at least gives me some peace of mind that I couldn't have caused it myself but I don't hear/read enough to really believe that.  I've eaten like shit for years and grew up before transfats and the like were fully known and sometimes wonder if our western diet isn't at least partially to blame for this not so rare but permanent disease.","My immune system decided to eat my left optic nerve last year. \n\nFour neurologists in, having received wildly differing prognoses and diagnoses, I've come to two conclusions; we know very little about the brain much less the immune system and neurologists use migraines in the same way many doctors blame viruses for inexplicable symptoms.\n\nDiet wise, I agree (I'm also Diabetic). Hardest thing about being diabetic is wondering if you did this to yourself somehow.","Curious about the details. I was diagnosed with mild Graves' disease a few years ago, but it's been in remission for a couple of years. \n\nI get migraines that often feel like somebody's kicking the back of my eyeball (usually one side at a time), and often wonder if my immune system is up to no good. Severe Graves' can cause eye problems, and it is an immune system problem.","T1D here with similar migraines, would love this answered as well.","In my case it's hopefully(!) acute disseminated encephalomyelitis which caused or occurred in tandem with optic neuritis; if not then I probably have multiple sclerosis. The only reason the diagnoses is important is the percentage chance of it being MS and the potential for beta interferon therapy. I have no idea what to do.\n\nMy picture of migraines stems from my mother's hormonal migraines. Each time she mensurated she would spend three days in bed in agony and vomiting. Apparently migraines can be much more than that - I have a mixed bag of symptoms that run from seeing things that aren't there and hearing loss to speech disturbance and episodes of exhaustion all of which can go on for weeks.

The body then attacks those mechanisms that it now believes are foreign due to the fungal proteins they contain.\n\nAnd presto, autoimmune disease.\n\n&gt;In the present study, we show that corpora amylacea from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) contain fungal proteins as detected by immunohistochemistry analyses. ... Additionally, CNS samples from patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) also contained CA that were immunoreactive with a range of antifungal antibodies. However, CA were less abundant in ALS or PD patients as compared to CNS samples from AD. By contrast, CA from brain tissue of control subjects were almost devoid of fungal immunoreactivity.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27013948\n\n&gt;The possibility that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has a microbial aetiology has been proposed by several researchers. Here, we provide evidence that tissue from the central nervous system (CNS) of AD patients contain fungal cells and hyphae. Fungal material can be detected both intra- and extracellularly using specific antibodies against several fungi. Different brain regions including external frontal cortex, cerebellar hemisphere, entorhinal cortex/hippocampus and choroid plexus contain fungal material, which is absent in brain tissue from control individuals. Analysis of brain sections from ten additional AD patients reveals that all are infected with fungi. Fungal infection is also observed in blood vessels, which may explain the vascular pathology frequently detected in AD patients.

This comes at a cost. In the first decade it's easy enough to have, as you feel absolute nothing from what happens after 20 years.

If I could go back and slap the younger me over the head with how I should have taken better care of myself, I would.\n\nIt's the long term, slow things that get you, and you won't know that until it's late to fix them.

We don't understand autoimmune diseases well enough.\n\nHowever, treatment is getting better and better, and taking less input from the individual. The \"bionic pancreas\" that's hopefully coming in the next few years is a massive step in that direction. I was lucky enough to meet one of the guys involved in working with it and he told me stories about going to restaurants, ordering whatever he wanted, and not having to think about taking insulin, the pump did it for him. Incredible.","They've been talking about this bionic pancreas shit for years, though, including trials and patients wearing it outside of clinical settings, and stuff. It's been going on for a least a decade, with the same 5-years-away stuff being said the whole time. \n\nAs a type 1 consumer, it's just as much pie-in-the-sky for me as a cure. \n\nMaybe one of these days it won't be.","A glorified pump+CGM combo is not a cure for me.

","Definitely. But the viacyte implant looks very promising too.","He described the process to me. The first time you get put on it, you input your body weight (I believe that was it). From that point on, a CGM tracks your bloodsugar and provides microdoses of insulin and glucagon (they had gone as far as hiring a laboratory to create a more stable form of glucagon that could last outside of a refrigerator for weeks or months, can't remember the exact length of time). He told me that after the first day of being on it, his bloodsugar did not go above 200, regardless of what he ate. He was on it for a month.

Once one of the many groups studying these finds an optimal combination we will in essence have a cure for t1d.","Because stopping the immune system is hard. I'd love a cure, I just don't think it's very likely to happen soon.\n\nAnyways, with stuff like the bionic pancreas coming along, diabetes will be little more than an afterthought if it works as well as I've been shown.","Having a bunch of electronics hanging off your body is not an afterthought. Having to refill the supplies all the time is not an afterthought. Not having enough space on your body to comfortably rotate pump sites is not an afterthought. Paying thousands of dollars a year in medical expenses even when on insurance is certainly not an afterthought. \n\nI agree with your skepticism regarding a true cure. But the \"bionic pancreas\" or \"artificial pancreas\" phrase pisses me off. There is so much hassle, inconvenience, challenge, and risk that comes with managing T1 diabetes, even if the pump/CGM combo gets smarter. ","Transplanting islet cells elsewhere in the body may be enough to trick the immune system, without the need to stop it. It might not work, but if it cures even just 10% of people to fully non-diabetic status, I'd call that a win. And if it cures no-one, maybe we get data out of it.

Totally out of the blue.  \n\nI have had a rather complex theory for 25+ years as to how I may have contributed to its onset. \n\nI was athlete at the time and doing quite a bit of weight-training and weight-gaining. So, I drank a LOT of cow's milk -- gallon, gallon-and-half a day, particularly once I arrived at U.Va. (because of the dining halls and milk dispensers and so forth).  Soy milk wasn't even a thing at conventional grocery stores then; didn't exist at the dining halls either.  And, admittedly, I WAS also drinking alcohol heavily because I had been rushing and it was my first year at University and so forth.  \n\nSo here's my theory:  \n\nThe proteins in milk are supposedly identical to beta cells.  Some of these milk proteins somehow made it in to my circulatory system.  Naturally the immune system responded by killing these milk-protein \"invaders,\" but in doing so, killed ALL similar proteins in the system, i.e. the beta cells of the pancreas.\n\nYou'll ask:  \"But how did they make it in to your system?  That's ridiculous.  What did you do, inject yourself with ...milk?\" \n\nIt's not a popular subject in the medical community, but some speculate that \"leaky gut\" may been a factor.  I was drinking alcohol heavily because it was my first year at University and I was socializing etc., and excessive alcohol-consumption supposedly causes a degree of \"intestinal permeability.\"  \n\nSo, a potentially permeable intestine coupled with perhaps a bit of undigested cow's milk that it allowed in to my system, plus my immune system kicking in to kill it and (ta-dah) I'm suddenly Type 1 Diabetic.\n\nYou'll say:  \"Mmmm...but do you see a lot of little kids or teenagers who are diagnosed Type 1 who have a diet VERY heavy in the liquids you described?  No, but they still get diagnosed with Type 1, right? Average adults?  Pregnant women?   They still get diagnosed Type 1.\"  (Note: Well, I have seen a few children and pregnant women drink a good amount of cow's milk for bone health, and so forth).  \n\nSo, obviously, my theory might be a bit peculiar to me \n\n(Although I have also heard some speculate that, in addition to alcohol, certain medications and treatments can also lead to a degree of intestinal permeability.  Just a bit of undigested cow's milk makes it through in to one's system AND...   But, just a theory.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","Interesting, I was just dx'd t1 at the age of 28 and I was huge into milk and alcohol. Like milk always made me sick to my stomach, but I loved it so much I still drank it","[removed]","/r/Microbiome \n\nhttp://www.microbiomedigest.com/","Sounds like Miastenia Gravis","assuming you mean myasthenia gravis, no, it doesn't.","I'm not really inclined to follow a diet that requires such specialized water intake.

The reason that you will need to do blood tests with a commercial meter is safety. What happens if the sensor detects you as having a high reading but really you're low?

And false readings aren't too uncommon.","[deleted]","It's a start, you can't go from initial research to system that fixes all your problems overnight, it takes time. The next step as I see it will be an implantable meter, that will provide better accuracy that an external meter will.\n\nYou'll still probably have to do blood tests for the forseeable future but compare this system on a kid to just a pump, kid wouldn't need to interact with the pump at all or be taught what to bolus (if they get it wrong, outlook not so good), their parent can check and control the meter remotely.","Can you give us any links you might have? For those who have never delved into this. Thanks.","Thank you for taking the time to post that. \n\nIs this why some research is referring to Alzheimer’s as Type 3 Diabetes? I had understood the root of that path was that the brain had its own insulin receptors and that the research surrounded the idea that insulin resistance in the brain might be the cause.","There def doesn't seem to be enough research.  I have been actively searching for studies to get into for UC but there just aren't any to participate in.  One day, hopefully sooner now that these Panama Papers are out, we'll get all of that money out of politics and into useful places like NASA and medical research.","Thanks for that! Maybe I can get in on the US testing later this year.","Ankylosing Spondylitis here. No cure, degenerative spine and joint problems, immune system deficiencies. Right now the best anyone can offer is ibuprofen and physio, with spinal surgery a last resort to reverse the fusion of vertebrae. Some people use TNF-α inhibitor for chronic cases, and it's remarkably effective, but they're all based on artificial antibodies and the side-effects can be horrendous (e.g. lupus, catching hepatitis or TB, etc.) to the point where they're not worth the risk for most sufferers.\n\nThere's been a massive uptick in research into the disease and its treatments over the last decade and it makes me really hopeful for more effective management and a reduction in symptom progression by the time I approach retirement age, which is when it's likely to do me the most good.","Yeah those side effects are not worth it.  I lost a friend to Lupus who also had Hep C.  I've never even heard of AS either so hopefully we'll all get to see actual golden years and not fool's gold down the road.","Could you elaborate on what an orphan drug is?  I (and presumably others, then) have never run across the term orphan-designated product.","Yea, sorry I was at work. So an orphan drug is a drug that is designed or researched for an \"orphan illness or orphan disease\" which basically just means a disease that is not very prevalent (many immune disorders) OR a disease that is prevalent but the industry has been ignoring due to financial disincentive (ex. malaria - b/c most victims are in Africa and drug companies don't make much selling or giving meds to these areas). \n\nBUT the ODA (orphan drug act) actually covers some straight up research for these illnesses, not just drug research. This is probably the better news for most people.","If it's legal where you are, try Cannabidiol tincture.

Syringes are absolutely more precise, and you can visually confirm that the exact dose you want has been delivered. ","ELI5 What does this mean for diabetics and the disease in general? ","According to the doctors his new diagnosis and young age (4 years old) made the pump less effective for now. Once he is \"stabilized\" they will reevaluated the pump option. I assume that means once his pancreas' beta cells have been completely killed off and he is totally insulin dependent","ohh ok just curious.  My sister has been on the pump for a couple years and ever since her A1c has been really good.  ","[removed]","I've been a type 2 diabetic for about 14 years now, and on two different insulins for about 5 of those years, and it certainly is frustrating. I'm 5'8 and weigh about 140lbs. So I'm certainly not overweight.\n\nWhat frustrates me is that so much of the work being done is for type 1 which comprises 10% of the total diabetics, not the 90% who are type 2.\n\nI take care of myself but still have a terrible time with my a1c. My last one was 9.6. It's very frustrating.\n\nHere in Canada the gov't pays for nothing. I have very limited private coverage so I pay about $300 per month. A pump is covered, but only for type 1 diabetics.\n\nI'm pretty sure that my pancreas has given up entirely at this point but as I'm diagnosed as type 2 I am eligible for basically no assistance. I'd love to have a pump but that seems to be pie in the sky and heaven forbid if I lose my job. No idea what I'd do then.\n\nI must say though that I have a wonderful pharmacist who will give me a month of my slow insulin when he has a card to use. He does more to help me than the Gov't health plan or private insurance. Bless him.\n\nIt is was it is though. Sorry for the rant. Rant over!","If your a1c levels are still high obviously you aren't watching what you eat carefully.\n\nMy ex's dad was like you. Thought he ate healthy ran and was no where near over weight but he developed type 2 anyways. He was always eating fresh fruits, smoothies, while wheat pastas, etc.\n\nI had to sit him down and show him how many grams of carbs he was eating a day. Even if they were healthy. Eventually heist used his diet to manage it but it took a while.\n\nStrangely enough when my ex moved with me from Alberta to Ontario she developed type 1 diabetes and her family was convinced it was the same as her dad's in that it could be fixed with diet and that she didn't need shots 3 times a day. She spent 3 days in the hospital with blood sugar levels of 50+. They sent the blood to 3 different hospitals to confirm (Trenton Belleville Kingston). No diets going to fix that in a quick amount of time ","Oh god, my mom is a t1d and she eats lots of fruit.  She won't listen to me about carbs. She says \"the nutritionist says I should eat fruit/beans/oatmeal because they're whole foods/\"good\" carbs!\"  I've tried to explain it to her, but she likes fruit and that's what she wants to hear.  Can't convince her otherwise. She is thin now, but had been chubby in the past. ","Have you ever been tested to confirm you don't actually have Type 1? It is estimated that 1 in 10 Type 2 patients are actually misdiagnosed Type 1, and that if you take all the overweight people out of that equation the amount of misdiagnosed is 1 in 2. So out of all people with Type2 who maintain a healthy weight, approx half of them are actually suffering autoimmune diabetes. My SO was one of the misdiagnosed. Diagnosed at 28 with Type 2 and a very fast decline into multiple complications before antibody testing discovered he actually has Type 1.5 or Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults. He now has, along with diabetes, retinopathy including being legally blind in one eye, kidney failure, heart disease, peripheral neuropathy, gastroparesis and hypertension. His doctor says these complications could have been slowed dramatically if he hadn't been misdiagnosed for 12 years.","[removed]"," I think in both our cases the joint pain is usually gone by now.

Especially since I'm planning on (finally) getting a CGM soon to watch myself more easily when I start working in a hospital this fall. And risk? Honestly, if you're taking care of yourself, you can take risk out of the equation in almost any situation. I can count on one hand the number of lows and highs that have been out of my control in the last 5 years.","Ah, cool, thanks.  I need to find one of those monitors.","Just look for ones that don't require a large blood sample. I used the Freestyle monitors but I guess availability depends on country","I am not convinced Type2 is strictly self inflicted. Is it not possible that children who have a parent who has type1 could not later develop diabetic symptoms in the form of type2. Are we certain type2 is caused by eating so much sugar or carbs and getting so fat our bodies stop producing insulin or absorbing it or did the chicken come before the egg? \n\nI believe it is possible that type2 could be genetic in some circumstances if not all. I think this way because obesity could be due to the failure of regulatory t-cells performing properly. Your body is meant to regulate your body weight. What would occur that would lead a person to ingest so many calories over a length of time to get this way and overide millions of years of evolution? I think something bigger is happening here and it is being ignored. \n\n","I had no idea that was the case, but now I want that answer as well.","[deleted]","The exaggeration is most often due to media setting the headlines. You can bet that the original publication isn't named with anything containing \"a complete picture\" or \"final piece of puzzle solved\".\n\nConsidering that there are many antigens involved in the autoimmune reactivity that causes the destruction of the insulin-producing cells, I'd also say that this study will be of relevance to some patients, although not all. Not everybody with diabetes will have autoreactivity against all the antigens that have been identified to associate with type I diabetes. I think that diabetes, just like in cancer, is moving towards more personalized medicine where it's important to distinguish between type I diabetes and type I diabetes, at least if we're trying to target the disease before it breaks out rather than fix the symptoms afterwards. Person A with diabetes I will have the same symptoms, but not the identical causes in terms of what antigen they're getting the auto-reaction against as Person B with diabetes I. For that reason, I think it's pretty important with studies like these even if they do not target the full repetoire of potential antigens in diabetes and even if they will not help everybody with type I diabetes. And even if this turns out to not fully cure/prevent the disease because it doesn't target the complete immunoprocess, it's possible that by intervening with part of the auto-reactivity- although you cannot block it completely- you'll manage to delay the destructio process and keep a decent part of the insulin production longer.","I am shocked that our own immune system which we thought was the one who fight back to intruders inside our body was also the one who attacks and destroys our own cells in the pancreas.","I remember there is a recent breakthrough where new beta cells were grown from stem cells, potentially allowing a cure for Type 1 diabetes, though the problem of immune cells attacking the beta cells in the first place could still be a problem.","&gt;Edit: I see a lot of people lamenting how breakthrough research never lives up to the hype. I look at it like this: If Reddit was around in the 1920's there would have been a post, Canadian researcher isolate small peptide from pancreas of dogs; use it to cure diabetes.\n\nIt's also worth noting that research doesn't have to 100% cure something to be useful and effective towards treatment. ","If anything this article might help educate people.  I have been doing emergency medicine for 12 years.  I was a medic in the military.  I worked for a hospital ER for 2.\n\nAnd, not until a friend got diabetes 5 years ago did I know that you could get type 1 diabetes at 30 years old.  He got it from some unknown auto immune disease that attacked his pancreas.  He didn't even know he had it until he started having trouble seeing and went to an optometrist. ","Thanks for clearing this up both for me and others there is a lot of confusion in the public in general about type one diabetes . The media really don't seem to understand and it all just makes it worse.\n\n\nThere has been a number of breakthroughs recently I follow a few but never get my hopes up. 15 years ago when I was diagnosed I was told that within 10 years we would have something.

The everyday water you see contains dissolved minerals and often suspended materials. But, for practical purposes, if you fill a glass from your faucet the water will look colorless to you. The water is in fact not colorless; even pure water is not colorless, but has a slight blue tint to it, best seen when looking through a long column of water. The blueness in water is not caused by the scattering of light, which is responsible for the sky being blue. Rather, water blueness comes from the water molecules absorbing the red end of the spectrum of visible light. To be even more detailed, the absorption of light in water is due to the way the atoms vibrate and absorb different wavelengths of light.

My grandmother was a Clinton supporter for two things. Her name, and the fact that she was a woman*. It took a few weeks but now she likes Sanders after hearing both of their views. Sadly, this isn't in the US but just saying that people can be won over. ","I think name recognition is the best explanation for Hillary and Donald's success. ","Hillary's \"name recognition\" comes from 25 + years of public service. \n\nSecretary of State of the United States of America. \n8 years as senator of the State of New York.\n8 years as First Lady of the United States.\n13 years as First Lady of the state of Arkansas.\n\n\"Name recognition\" \n\n","It's mostly being first lady of the U.S. and then running for the dem nomination in 2008. You can have 30+ years of public service as a senator and not have name recognition because only a few politicians are known by the majority of citizens. Most people can't name a single Congressman or Senator from a state other than their own. And they probably can't even name all of the ones from their own state. Same goes for Governors and Mayors.","It actually came from being the first lady involved in a huge scandal...","Or an extreamly public fight for universal health care. Or her very public denouncing of human rights abuses while visiting China..\n\n","All that needs is \"A lifetime of crime and corruption, priceless\" at the end ","How is voting within the system a revolution? ","A revolution doesn't have to be a violent overthrow of a system from the outside. A revolution can come from the inside of a system, and be peaceful at the same time, without losing any of its legitimacy. All that's required is a radical shift in how the system operates.\n\nNow, I would argue that Bernie isn't honestly all that radical. Most of his ideas are just good, common sense, politically and economically, but the fact that he's gaining so much traction when America has been opposed to these ideas for so long is what makes this a revolution (albeit a very peaceful one, which I consider a wonderful thing).","indeed. in most other countries, bernie doesn't qualify as a radical at all. it's just our political system is so corrupt that having anybody who speaks about actual reality at all in the public sphere is revolutionary.","I don't think we even know what a revolution is. It's been a buzzword in our society for so long that it's lost any intrinsic meaning somewhere in the mid-90s during an ad campaign for children's toys or something. Even if a revolution could happen through a broken voting process, I'm not sure it can come from the presidential seat. Everyone seems to have forgotten the job description of the president of the United States of America and it is frustrating. They are the head of the armed forces. They can pardon people. They can appoint ambassadors and judges to the Supreme Court. Nowhere does it say they can pass laws to stimulate a revolution. Even with the questionable executive order functions of the president, I don't see anything major changing socially. Sure I would love to see real true positive change that I don't have to exchange my freedoms for...but this situation is almost identical to Obama and we all know that hope and change can't make a revolutionary paradigm shift occur. ","It's still no revolution. Even a peaceful one would need to overthrow the political system to be called a revolution.","Well, for 1) Any other kind of revolution would be a federal crime and 2) How else are we going to achieve change? Go ask the pure anarchists how well not partaking in the system is getting the fall of government or sinn Fein refusing to be in parliament is helping out that northern irish cause. \n\n","The RNC prefers HRC over Trump.

There are still a lot of possibilities for him to win the nomination. Assuming there's not voter suppression and fraud in the up coming states (which there will be) he would mostly win all the big states. Now assuming he loses those states based off the voter fraud that has been going on, Bernie can still take it all the way to the convention and try to convince superdelegates that he is better at beating Trump in the general than Hillary, since Hillary only appeals to old loyal democrats, and Bernie appeals to all other demographics, which greatly out numbers the old loyal democrats. As of right now, Hillary doesn't appeal to anything else, and isn't trying to appeal to the demographics that support Bernie, she kind of just expects them to vote for her without doing anything to win them over. But I can tell you that a big % of Bernie supporters hate Hillary, and will not vote for her no matter what. If the superdelegates look at the facts, then turning to Bernie would be the only way to prevent a republican from taking the white house. \n\n\nThere's also the possibility that Hillary will be indicted. Again, if the superdelegates are smart, they would not put all their eggs in the Hillary basket, because if she gets indicted if she is the nominee, that's like handing over Trump the keys to the white house. \n\n\nNow in order for Bernie to appeal to the superdelegates, he may not have to necessarily win most of these states going forward, but he does have to get as many votes as possible in every state. So the Bernie supporters turning on Bernie, or giving up on him are not helping his case if they want him to really be the nominee. \n\n\n","lol u/fedart","Yeah","Likely? No. Legit?

Further, many polls show democrats want the speeches released which shows they do care about it.\n\nAs an aside, I agree with the other guy, you cannot (meaningfully) regulate an industry that financially supports you. It's a conflict of interest. ","She's been asked that question at nearly every debate so it's not just us that wants to know.

But we need to stop crying wolf at every state we don't win so when shit like Arizona and New York happen people can't be like \"oh there they go again saying the system is rigged.\"","&gt;troll amount is well over 10x what it was prior to NY\n\nBecause Bernie was crushed in NY and people on Reddit are sick and tired of constant spam for a candidate who has no hope anymore?\n\n&gt;neither candidate is near being mathematically eliminated\n\nFair point, I should've said that barring a miracle, he's essentially done for, unless you think he can pull off a 58% win in all of the states remaining, including those on Tuesday, and I'm pretty sure he's currently behind in all of them.\n\n&gt;conveniently ignoring shenanigans in arizona, massachusetts, washington, wyoming, new york that have measurable impact on results\n\nWell considering both campaigns have asked for investigations in Arizona, I'd say we can rule that one out. Considering that Bill Clinton broke no laws and it's doubtful that his presence had a huge effect on the results, we can rule that out. I'm not as sure about what happened in Washington and Wyoming. And your point about New York is completely laughable. It was registered Democrats who were purged from the record, who prefer Clinton over Sanders by polling. Additionally, assuming that the purged voters are a random sample of the overall sample, they would've still been mostly for Hillary. All in all, New York's issues actually helped Hillary.\n\nSo really, unless you're saying all of these small things added up to a few million votes, then yes -- Bernie is not as popular as Hillary and is lacking in those votes.","[deleted]","Apparently you're a low information voter and not worth my time.","Just fyi: your subreddit no longer makes the front page.

Add that to the fact that Norway is one of the richest countries in terms of natural resources on the planet, and you get a successful society.

It's one of the big things mentioned in Clausewitz's *On War*, one of the most influential books ever written from a military standpoint. \n\nThe second chapter of the book can basically be paraphrased as \"crush them so badly they'll never be able to fight back.\" \n\nA good real world example of this would be the results of the Franco-Prussian war. The Germans took the industrial region of Alsace-Lorraine from France, and with it most of France's access to iron. They reasoned that without iron, France would be far less capable of waging a war in future. ","I think there's a difference between crushing them so much they won't be able to fight back and crushing them so much that not only do they not want to fight back, nobody else does either.","In the real world, there are very few examples of beating someone else so soundly that no one else wants to fight you - Ghengis Khan is a good example of this, because he combined the threat of complete annihilation with the promise that swearing loyalty to him would be rewarded. \n\nIn most cases, the realistic outcome of completely crushing someone's ability to wage war is that everyone else becomes afraid enough to gang up and do the same to you - such as what happened to Napoleon after his initial conquests or the effects of the Treaty of Versailles on Germany and Austria-Hungary after they lost WW1, to varying degrees of success. \n\nEnder's Game actually borrows a lot of the tactics and philosophies from previous military thinkers, which is not a bad thing since it highlights the fact that a small child is capable of reaching the same conclusions as some of the greatest strategists and tacticians to ever live.

We promised Japan complete and utter annihilation should they not give up with an unconditional surrender. They were already in talks of a conditional surrender, but we weren't satisfied due to our total war unconditional surrender moto during WW2. \n\nSo instead of waiting for the Soviets to join, or merely setting a blockade and continuing with the fire bombings, we decided to test out our brand new nuke technology. However even after the nukes were dropped, despite all the damage, the Japanese held on to a hope of achieving a conditional surrender, since the Soviets hadn't invaded yet. But once the Soviets finally entered the war, soon after the bombs were dropped, that made the Japanese give up any hope in achieving a conditional surrender.\n\nSome (many) theorize that the atomic bombs were more likely used as a power play, to show the Soviets &amp; the rest of the world the complete and utter destruction that the U.S. was capable of, and to make an example of the Japanese, using their non-immediate unconditional surrender to justify the nukes dropped, when they would have likely surrendered soon anyways, even without a land-invasion of Japan.","IIRC the Emperor of Japan at the time balked after the Hiroshima bombing, assuming that we only had one nuke.","Fuck that. This is basically Israel's method of bombing the fuck out of the Palestinians and it doesn't really do much but cause more harm and hatred and revenge. \n\nIronically, it's also the same philosophy Hitler had when he was trying to gas the Jews. ","Hitler was trying to wipe entire peoples off of the Earth with the gassing. You're really referring to the Blitzkrieg strategy which was super-intimidating and discouraged resistance.\n\nAlso, there's a difference between beating an opponent so much nobody wants to oppose you and indiscriminately attacking people (though my use of a *Tropic Thunder* quote was probably ill-advised for this point).","&gt; You're really referring to the Blitzkrieg strategy which was super-intimidating and discouraged resistance.\n\nNo, I'm talking about the entire genocide of a particular culture to the point they no longer exist. That's the entire point of the scorched earth metaphor.\n\nThe entire point of the Blitzkreig aka lightning war was just to invade before anyone knew what was going on. The reason they were invading was to get resources and land gains. It's why the Nazis allied with the Russians to take over Poland and split the loot.","&gt; A scorched earth policy is a military strategy that targets anything that might be useful to the enemy while advancing through or withdrawing from an area. Specifically, all of the assets that are used or can be used by the enemy are targeted, such as food sources, transportation, communications, industrial resources, and even the people in the area.\n\nAnd a paragraph later:\n\n&gt; A scorched earth policy was famously used by Joseph Stalin against the German Army's invasion of the Soviet Union in the Second World War,[1] by William Tecumseh Sherman during his March to the Sea in the American Civil War, by Lord Kitchener against the Boers, and by the Russian army during the failed Napoleonic invasion of Russia.\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article on \"Scorched Earth\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_earth","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthaginian_peace","No, \"Scorched Earth\" is laying the area to waste. Genocide is not inherently scorched Earth, especially not the way the Nazis did it.","Scorched earth is basically decimating the entire region and destroying everything, including people, to the point that it's inhabitable.","&gt; to the point that it's inhabitable.\n\nFirst, I believe you meant *un*inhabitable. Second, that's not how the Holocaust was carried out. Third, I just finished a second reply to your previous comment which covered that it's not that extreme.","Doh, yeah. Uninhabitable.\n\n","Decimating is taking out only one tenth.  It is the opposite of what most people think it means.  Not total destruction but a very restrained meting out of punishment.","Decimating originally meant taking one tenth, but the modern usage just means to kill or destroy a large portion of something. Language evolves. ","I guess I didn't get the memo on that one.  Much like I didn't get the memo that \"literally\" has evolved in a matter of a few years to mean the exact opposite.  ","[It's not as if it's a new development](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/09/does-decimate-mean-destroy-one-tenth/). According to this, the word originally referred to tithing money rather than the Roman practice of punishment. If we treat \"killed or destroyed a large portion\" as an incorrect use of the word, then using it to mean \"killed one tenth\" is just as incorrect. \n\nThe literally/figuratively thing is a very rapid example of a word changing meanings, but considering how different the English language is now than it was a few hundred years ago, it's ridiculous for people to be upset that a word like \"decimate\" has changed meaning over the years.","Now you're just playing semantics.","Thanks mate!","Props here to the guy front right: he sees his mate launch the first paddle and he *instinctively* covers his own nuts with the paddle still in his hand.

Are you sure gay guys have enough patience to actually exchange words before sex? Seems to me like one guy would just start fucking the other one and if he doesn't like it then oh well. \n\nSorry.

","Lol ","&gt; -Sometimes a gay hookup doesn't even involve fucking\n\nThere's a lot of guys that are jokingly known as \"sides,\" because they're not interested in butt stuff. They aren't a top or a bottom, so they're called a \"side\".\n\nI think straight people overestimate how much butt sex is going on between us guys. The majority of all my hookups have been trading blowjobs, mutual masturbation, and frotting. ","\"Frotting\"  short for \"frottage?\"","Is \"docking\" really a thing?","Yes, but it's not that popular, especially in the US since it requires a foreskin.","Huh, TIL.","&gt;causal sex","Every gay sex interaction starts with 4 magical words, \"what are you into?\" In my opinion this is where most gay people get it right and most straight people get it wrong. When 2 straight people agree to hookup it's already unspoken and assumed that this girl is going to get fucked, there typically isn't any, \"what are you into\" talk because there's really no perceived need, it's already known by both parties. With gay encounters, there's typically a conversation after consent is reached, negotiations are drawn up (figuratively) and fetishes are placed on the table for discussion. \n\nEdit: for people wondering about the deleted comment above mine, it was basically just asking how gay people go about negotiating sex. \n","Sounds a bit like mild Game of Thrones politics....

","Unfortunately, as an elected official, Fallin is held to different standards than unelected people. When you use state property as your own to park a private trailer on, it isn't good. Furthermore, as far as I know, the Fallin family has at least one other home...so why did she use state property, which in the end was illegal? It's not an attack on her family, it's an attack on her judgement.","Out of all the harm her and her cohorts are doing to the state, focusing your attention on that actually hurts your case. Most people really don't care about it.\n\nYes, the violation technically is \"illegal\", but so is Jaywalking. Would her getting a jaywalking citation warrant mention a year later?\n\n&gt; Oklahoma City’s city code prohibits travel trailers from being used a dwelling for more than 14 days in a calendar year.  \n\n&gt; The governor’s mansion is exempt because it’s state property.\n\n&gt; But according to KFOR, the trailer violates a different ordinance:\n\n&gt; The Capitol Medical Center Improvement Zoning Commission does state that you cannot have a trailer on state property in a certain area, which includes the governor’s mansion.\n\nIt was a minor zoning violation and with three conflicting laws, it is understandable how she could have thought it was legal. Once the correct law was pointed out, the issue was corrected promptly.. But over a year later you are still attacking her over it. \n\nIt's such a petty thing. It wasn't a political fuckup, it was a relatively minor *personal* fuck up. \n\nAgain, *please don't take this as defending her*, that is not my intention. **She is a terrible governor who is hurting the state.** But focus your criticisms on the things that matter. Personal shit like this makes you look as bad as it makes her look.","Although the zoning law by itself is petty, I don't think criticizing a person in such a high office for something like this is. Allowing nepotism or cronyism to create unfair advantages while not bothering to investigate either the law or the perceptual consequences is symptomatic of leadership that lacks foresight. In the context of my original post, I used this example as an almost absurd combination of the two and not as an ad hominem attack on Fallin herself. So no, this is not \"personal shit\".","I completely agree with criticizing her, as I have said all along.\n\nAnd while *you* might not mean to make it personal, [that certainly has not been the case with  everyone](http://jezebel.com/ok-governor-mary-fallins-loser-adult-kids-are-living-at-1720657894).\n\nBut how do you know that she didn't investigate the laws? That seems like a big leap to me. I suspect she almost certainly DID check with her staff-- and was told that since it is state property, it was legal.\n\nSeriously, if you were in her position, would you think to check the Capitol Medical Center Improvement Zoning Commission rules to verify that they don't override the laws that would apply virtually everywhere else in the state?\n\nTo me, it was an innocent mistake that even a staff lawyer could easily have made. Even the media initially said the arrangement was legal before finding the fairly obscure rule that changed that. \n\nAs for cronyism, I don't buy it. Normally with a zoning violation, the violator is given the chance to address the issue prior to facing fines. That seems to be exactly what happened here. She unintentionally violated the code, and once it was brought to her attention, she addressed it. *That is how the law should work.*\n\nI agree the governor should not get special treatment, but I also think she should not get \"special abuse\". It seems to me that the situation was handled pretty much exactly as it would have been for anyone else (And yes, you certainly can find egregious examples to the contrary, but they are the exception, not the rule).","I'm glad that she had it removed, because in comparison to the lawmakers in the legislature and their actions, she seems rational. As for cronyism/corruption in Oklahoma, it goes back decades at the highest levels. If you truly are a recent transplant to Oklahoma, you should know it struggles with transparency and accountability. Things happen behind closed doors, without the public knowing all too often, and they purposely keep people uninformed. Furthermore, this example of the trailer is a perfect example of how things operate \"under the law\" in OK: do it without asking, if anyone gets mad, fix it or make it disappear. Basically, do not enforce the law if that law is inconvenient for whatever reason.

There are good people in government, I'm not denying that, but to not suspect that the head of government is not somehow influenced by a network of party members who generally don't care about the law if it hinders them is choosing to be blind. Is Fallin clean herself? Probably. Is \"Trailergate\" petty? By itself, yes. Was it misconstrued as a gross personal attack in some publications? Yes (but what isn't?). Does that make it \"off-limits\" to use to criticize her leadership? I don't think so.

If not, some legislator can still introduce it for you in an effort to secure your vote for his/her reelection later.\n\nSecond, this can just be a natural response to perceived change in the 'wrong direction.' Polls seem to consistently indicate that most Americans (significantly above a majority) believe our country to be on the \"wrong track\" rather than headed in the \"right direction,\" which likely reflects disagreement about occurrences from a variety of perspectives. Liberals see the kinds of activity referenced in this article (tougher abortion laws, etc.), and conservatives see other proposals they don't like (e.g., Target's recent bathroom policy, and other legislation that might be passed in San Francisco or California with a similar idea in mind), and everyone is unhappy. This naturally results in people just trying to secure what they believe is right. And whoever has the majority perspective in that city or state will win the day on the legislation fight.

She announced one day that she was voting for Obama cuz he was going to legalize weed. I tried telling her that he really couldn't do that, it is Congress that makes laws and the DEA that schedules drugs and all that, but no. She told me that I was \"fucking stupid.\"\n\nOf course, this is the same girl that told me her shoes were expired.

There is a date right here!\"\n\nSo I put down my marker, turned off the overhead, made sure that the class was quiet, and said: \"Storm honey - shoes don't expire. They just kind of wear out. That is the date they were made.\"\n\n\"You don't know what the fuck you are talking about. I ain't wearin no expired ass shoes. Ima get me some new kicks.\"\n\nSure enough, she walked into class wearing a new pair of $200 Jordans the next day. She threw away her perfectly good, and equally expensive shoes.\n\nI didn't have the heart to ask her to check the date on them for fear of destroying her world view.\n\nShe went on to have two kids by two different fathers and last I knew was dealing crack and blowing dealers to get by.","His administration has given all power for marijuana regulation to the states and have openly said that they (the feds) will not interfere with the state's decisions. This has been huge for all the legalization progress we've seen in the last 4 years considering weed is still federally illegal and thus should be illegal throughout the U.S. (see U.S. Supremacy Clause)... way more than 'basically nothing' in my eyes. If the next president has a different view on the rights of each state to regulate marijuana it'll only be a matter of time before the feds come and fuck up our dispensaries. ","Okay well idk if he was *directly* involved, but since the time of his election, we have had multiple states make it recreationally legal.","Sure.

Just legalize everything and have natural selection do the rest)","I think alcohol will become less socially acceptable, and weed will continue to become more socially accepted.

You're getting me all excited for nothing. I completely understand how people are thinking it could be legal soon but it just won't. These people who run our country profit in the billions because of its illegality. The US government is running for one prime purpose now and that is money. They are not listening to us the people's opinions anymore and we are basically non existent in their views. They change laws and make things illegal all the time. All that matters is if it suits them and if they will profit from it. I hope with every ounce of my being that weed is legal federally in the next 5 years. But it's just not likely with our government having all the control and power over it. We need to have another fucking woodstock is what we need to do. If we do something so large and powerful as a people that they couldn't stop it like Woodstock we would really show that we mean business if there are millions of people smoking and safely doing so. ","True the government does run on money, but you also have to realise that weed is a HUGE cash crop. Its estimated that we could pay off the national debt with taxs from weed within 10 years. Also big pharma would still exist, sick people still need medicine although some would be fazed out due to the medical uses of weed. I wouldnt be suprised if Obama made a push for legal weed right before leaving office as he has been in support of it but has had to worry about \"political suicide.\" I dont think trump would legalize but Im sure bernie would. There are now 24 states with some form of legal marijana and more making the push. While the future of legal weed has looked grim in the past its actually becoming a reality sometime in the near future.","Lol I know it's a cash crop obviously. I heavily support it in all aspects. But do you not realize the way the government is? If they legalized weed now they would be admitting defeat to the drug war and that they lied to everyone for so long with no reasoning. That will not happen. If you think it's coming along so much then tell me how this is possible http://norml.org/laws/item/new-jersey-penalties-2. I completely understand how you see it becoming more and more acceptable but trust me it is not everywhere people feel like that. I wish it was but it just isn't. The legal stuff is all for medical purposes and not like you think it is. There are less than 5 recreational states to my knowledge and that is still considered federally illegal and they do get busted all the time by the DEA bitches. But it being legal and being able to legally buy it the way you do so to alcohol is nowhere close for the entire US. I absolutely do not see this happening within the next 10 years and it would need to have a massive positive study revealed about it to tons of people to even make it somewhat possible. I'd fucking love it if that could happen but it just won't. All the people in office have been lied to their entire lives and convinced marijuana is a deadly and toxic drug and they will not just alter their views for somebody they are set on their views and it will stay that way for a while","True most people who hold office are narrow minded people who look only to further there own personal agenda, be the govt already admitted the drug war is a massive failure and waste of time. A huge stepping stone here is the dea's judgment of weed. They had placed it wrongfully at a schedule 1 and just came out to say that is wrong and is rescheduling weed. This is essentaly the first major step required for federal legalization or at least decriminalization. Now its true I dont see recreational weed being legal right off the bat but I think fedral medical weed will be coming very soon.","Okay I got you. Legal medical federal weed is definitely a stepping stone for recreational weed. If that happens which I do see happening within the next 5 years, it may bring a better view to marijuana and it's true value. It will also set a path for recreational weed to sprout and follow. I didn't know you meant medical you didn't specify but now that you did I completely agree. It will help it out a lot. But not sure where you are but some of us in the US have really shitty marijuana laws a few I can think of are NJ, Florida, Texas, and New York. They all have really shitty policies on marijuana and if they would all get decriminalized and legalized it would spread to nearby states. I hope PA becomes legal soon ","Im from Wyoming and we have some pretty bad laws here, I went to jail for 0.0021g im sure they had to dig through the carpet to find those crumbs.","What in the fuck? That is fucking insane. Did you not have a lawyer or something? I've never been arrested but I know people who have and on their first offense it almost always gets tossed and ends in probation and community service","I ended up serving 90 days. Thats with the lawyer, I had a plea set up with the country prosecutor for 1 year unsup probation and the judge agreed to the deal. When they were wrapping things up and asking for any last comments the prosecutor decided to take back his deal because \"I wasnt taking this seriously\" and even the judge was shocked. I litteraly didnt say a word durring the whole trial unless specificly asked a question by the judge. The deputy that took me back to jail said that was complete bullshit. I guess the prosecutor was trying to rack in cases so he could look good for an upcoming election.","That's fucking ridiculous. Damn I can't believe how that shit works out. My friend in Florida was fighting with his girlfriend over some stupid shit and she ended up calling the cops saying that he was gonna hit her or some shit and they came into the house, smelled weed and told him if he gives it to them nobody will get in trouble. He gave them a jar with like 25 grams in it and they ruled it over an ounce or something and he got a felony charge and 90 days of community service but his aunt is a lawyer so she got it all expunged and cleaned from his record somehow. It's nuts how shit works out in this country. What you went through though is utter bullshit.

However, it wasn't exactly technically fully illegal, it was just basically illegal in practice due to some some weird legal things until the 1970s.  Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act in the 1970s.\n\nI believe at that point, marijuana was recommended to be temporarily put into the Schedule 1 categorization, but that 'temporary' part basically fell by the wayside.  I do believe that was at least partly, perhaps largely, related to the influence from the Nixon administration, but he didn't simply make marijuana illegal.\n\nReagan and Nixon both were pretty strongly against drugs, but neither of them technically made marijuana illegal themselves.  You might say that the influence of their administrations supported the laws, policies, culture, etc, though.  \n\nI personally think Obama has actually helped to lay the groundwork for things to perhaps happen soon - at least in his tone, he seems to somewhat push the conversation about needing drug and penal system reform, which is supported by his pardoning of many non-violent drug offenders that had excessive sentencing.  I think he's done far more than his predecessors, in general, and I suspect that there are movements in Washington to (fairly soon) make some changes - there are initiatives already proposed.  I don't think marijuana legalization has been his top priority, nor (probably) should it have been, but we'll see what happens in the next couple of years or so. \n\nI do think that it matters, though, for various reasons.  I'm not saying it's insignificant.  ","Well it was added to the FDAs drug scheduling, which means the DEA has policies in place for each level of scheduling.

There are grains of truth in what you're saying, but also big gaps.\n\nTo get back to the initial point, the president did not make marijuana illegal.

I would have him direct the appropriate people to push through modified treaties that remove our self-created international obligations for prohibition.\n3.  I would have his Attorney General order a complete re-review of cannabis and other appropriate drugs and actually take the scientific facts into account as the Substance Control Act states.\n4.  I would have him re-appropriate the resources of his departments like the DEA to other more important tasks or maybe even order them to not use all their budget.  (he's actually done this to a certain extent by not enforcing federal law in the states that have legalized).  \n\nAnd honestly, as much as Executive Power has grown over the recent decades, there's probably a lot more he can do.

Yes.  They could very possibly pass new laws to override his actions.  But that's the job of a leader to fight for the people they are responsible for. ","At what cost?

I already said they could eat or vape it, you're just restating that and claiming you were talking about something which via context, we weren't.","Haha wow you must have missed that comment about lowering alcohol's acceptance then.

Speaking just to the one I was replying, I honestly think that while 'everyone' won't be okay with smoking in public (for good reason), there will be places to smoke in public.  Everyone isn't okay with drinking in public either, it's illegal most public places now and would be with cannabis too I bet.  I feel like in places one 'could use' cannabis when legal, that there are many functional ways to imbibe.  The big difference between smoking or drinking doesn't exist to me because you could literally sell and drink cannabis infused drinks (or food, or vape, etc).\n\nThanks for pointing that out though, I feel like an ass being all pedantic in my previous comment after I looked at the context last night.

It is not healthy for one to think this way. I can't just one day say I'm a female so you have to let me use female facilities because fuck logic. ","&gt; Evidence suggests that people who identify with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth, may do so not just due to psychological or behavioral causes, but also biological ones related to their genetics, the makeup of their brains, or prenatal exposure to hormones.\n\nThe modern understanding of trans people is that it's actually quite likely that instead of trans people being delusional, there's evidence that their brain structure and whatnot are physiologically the same as the gender they identify as. Meaning it's a strong possibility that it is in fact their body's that require realignment instead of their psyche. \n\nRegardless of that, treating it purely as a mental illness, and trying to convince them that they truly are the gender they were assigned at birth, is not nearly as effective as allowing them to transition. \n\n&gt; I can't just one day say I'm a female so you have to let me use female facilities because fuck logic.\n\nTrans people usually go through hormone therapy, and transition socially well before using the bathroom of the gender they identify as. A very long, drawn out, and at times painful process. And when they do use the restroom, it's in fear. After all, while you may feel society has left you behind in their acceptance of trans people, there are still so many that are filled with hate and ignorance. I've seen many people on reddit say if they saw a trans person entering the wrong restroom they'd violently remove them. Which begs the question what happens when a trans person does use the bathroom of the gender they were assigned at birth? What if the observer confuses them as going into the wrong bathroom because of how they were presenting?\n\nIt's a whole big issue that could just be solved by trying to just have some understanding I think.","It's just not normal. I couldn't care less if you like men or women, but when you have those individuals who identify as a different gender it just gets ridiculous. You speak of \"genders assigned at birth\" as if there's plenty of options, you're either a male or female. yoh know what, I identify as 7 year old girl. If I, a 25 year old male, were to give the girl a kiss, what would you think? Would you accept that I identify as a seven year old girl and that kissing a little kid is child's play? Or would you immediately detain me and call the police? Put your family in this situation, see if you would be okay with it and accept that they identify as a little girl so it's okay. Ignore the fact that it's a 25 year old male. ","Do you identify as a 7 year old girl?","Will that change your answer? Because if it does then you proved me right. ","Do you?","Sure I guess. ","How long have you identified as 7?","Different guy here.I completely understand that. And I'm not saying they're wrong. I'm not saying they're making it up. People can honestly believe they are in the wrong body. I just dont agree with letting a man, use a woman's restrooms because he feels he's a woman. Until he's undergone physical changes, he's still a man. Like it or not. You can't make a bunch of women uncomfortable, or vice versa, because one person thinks he's in the wrong body. ","By \"undergoing physical changes\" do you mean passing as the gender they identify, or fully going through genital surgery?","Going through the genital surgery.","If they're already passing as the gender they identify as then there genitalia is a non issue in terms of using the bathroom I think. I mean I dont know about you but I don't get an eyeful of everyones genetalia when I enter the bathroom. And if you do happen to be closely inspecting someones genitals when their in a stall that seems pretty predatory in itself.\n\nOn the surface I think it's fairly reasonable to suspect that trans people go through the full transitional process. However, there are a multitude of factors at play that make this proposed mandate to a degree, an almost impossible barrier for many trans people. To start out it is majorly expensive to get the surgery, and many insurances don't cover it or very likely the trans person doesn't have insurance to begin with. Say they decide to save up for the surgery. In the mean time they still socially and hormonally transitioned, and while being able to use the bathroom the identify as poses virtually no risk of actual harm to others around them, using the bathroom of the gender that they aren't presenting as puts them at risk for having to out themselves which puts them at risk of things like sexual assault or physical violence. And those to are just an addition to the fact that they'd be outing themselves which in itself can be a great detriment to trans people.\n\n","Yea, i get what you say. And i see both sides of it...

","Are you serious?  Urinals save space, time, and cost.  Since you think individual bathrooms is a reasonable idea, you must not be thinking of the logistics.  The reason womens' restrooms often have longer lines is because you can fit a ton of urinals into a place, and people move quickly through them.

","An extremely tiny group of people wont be able to force everyone to build something that isn't feasible.

We already have laws about accommodating the physically handicapped, this idea though isn't objective.  You're still not thinking about how unfeasible it would be to require stadiums, airports, etc to have little rooms for every single person who needs to pee.\n\nEdit: How do constitutional rights have anything to do with this?  No is having their rights or freedom taken away.  This is a new issue being made up.","I'm not saying \"need\" to.

I'm merely pointing out that people are having two different conversations (whether or not they deserve those rights, and whether or not individual bathrooms are economically feasible).\n","I thought I addressed both points.   What does \"trans people\" mean really?  Laws about bathrooms and accessibility has always been a physical issue.  We are going to be a really nutty nation if our whole system is turned on its head because a small amount of people have mental issues.

Big places have family bathrooms specifically to deal with situations like that, but it's still a huge problem depending on where you live. \n\nIMO it speaks to how stupid gender-based bathrooms are in the first place. Privacy from adults of the opposite sex is a metric beyond stupid for splitting bathrooms up. We need individual bathrooms - not stalls, complete bathrooms.

He argued with the court, telling them he did not know the guy was a cop because he didn't identify himself and didn't have police clothes on. Upon hearing that, the judge gave leniency.

Just thought it was an interesting tidbit :) It more just irks me how some knifesmiths try to get people to buy into mumbo jumbo, I saw someone local advertising their knives as edge packed at the Renaissance Fair recently! ","It's a simple fact that a join is never as string as the original, so Damascus introduces a risk of delamination.","yeah, i've never seen any pictures or stories of anyone who has ever encountered this.... but technically I imagine you're right, I just don't think it happens much in reality if the damascus is forged properly.","As you say, it's a technicality. Scientifically, the join can never be as strong as the original material, but it's so strong it doesn't matter. I remember a discussion on the way pokers were made with the rakey hook bit that points back. The conventional way is to cut the stock 3/4 of the way through, fold it back on itself and faggot weld an inch of it to form the point. Some claimed that this wasn't the strongest way of welding and advocated for a scarfed weld.\n\nSomeone did some testing with a 12mm faggot welded poker and was able to hang 400lb's worth of anvil from the welded hook with no sign of failiure. The exact same discussion was had, that technically the scarfed weld would be stronger, but it's a goddamn fire poker! If it can support 400lb of weight, there's no need to go into a more lengthy process to make it even stronger! ","Right... exactly.  While I appreciate having something be exceptional, and the best.... welll, there comes a point of diminishing returns.   Personally I don't care for damascus much anyhow, beyond aesthetics.   I wouldn't use a blade like that seriously.\n\n\nBack in the day though, wootz steel was amazing... but modern steels beat it hands down, and the knowledge of it has been lost for centuries.... though recently people have claimed to have re-created it.\n\n\nIt looks like a random pattern welded damascus, but it's not the same.","The film director?","Drrp, JD Verhoeven!

I've lost several kitchen knives this way. \n\n","I can definitely see that with kitchen knives. There are tradeoffs when heat treating a knife. If you leave a blade mostly hard, it will take a finer edge and take much longer to get dull, but it also leaves it brittle. If you temper it at a higher temperature you make the steel softer, but tougher. Kitchen knives are usually incredibly hard for their size (especially high end Japanese style) because it gives much better performance for it's intended use, while cleavers and camp knives are expected to endure shock loads and are tempered softer.

I usually use all my knives but haven't brought myself to do it yet.  I probably will one day.\n\n\nThough I hear S90V is a real pain to sharpen... but it tends to keep the edge a long while, so that's the tradeoff.   I have decent sharpening skills and tools for it so i'm confident i'd be able, even if it would take a while...

To the layman, probably not a noticeable difference, but a difference none the less. This also varies depending on which steels are forge welded to create the Damascus.","deadly poison increases your attack by 2, so its stronger","The acid wont do anything unless its undiluted and the blade sits there for weeks.  The only thing its doing is causing an oxidation barrier on the higher carbon steels mqking them darker but not on the higher nickle content steels.  How ever damascus or pattern welded steel has a single flaw which is very serious. It's called delamination.  This occurs when the steel isnt welded properly and the layers start to come undone. ","The acid shouldn't weaken the blade any.  Consider it a surface deep chemical attack on the steel.  You can usually remove an acid etch with a quick buff of the surface.  In industry, this is commonly called acid etching.  We use it all the time to pull out visual representations of weld joint macro and micro structures for examination.  It's incredibly useful for repairs as well.  ","If the steel is forged and folded like the layers are revealed, it should have a better structure, but it depends how the forging was cooled and how many layers, that were folded.\n\nBut I think this more of an aesthetic thing, when buying knives.\n\n","Nowadays Damascus steel isn't really that special, but in medieval times it was arguably the best steel in the world (arguably as it's likely the Japanese Katana was superior but there's no recorded instance of them meeting).  To give you an idea, when someone wielding a Damascus blade came up against your average English Knight, it wasn't all that uncommon for the knights blade to straight up be cut in half by the Damascus one.  ","&gt; To give you an idea, when someone wielding a Damascus blade came up against your average English Knight, it wasn't all that uncommon for the knights blade to straight up be cut in half by the Damascus one.\n\nI'm gonna call bullshit on that, unless you can give me a source. Also, Japanese steel was not better. As /u/HuffsGOldStars said, it was folded so many times because the materials were not as good as western steel. This is why western blacksmiths don't have the same tradition of folding steel, because they did not need it.","You are correct on all counts.\n\nAlso,  I'm going to point out something  (and, really this bothers the shit out of me). What we call \"Damascus\" steel today ***ISN'T*** really true Damascus steel. It's forged like it, but the actual formula for the base steel is still unknown.  It seems to me, that there's an additive that we're missing.  \n\nNo shit, I honestly think it's something stupid simple that we just overlook because it's so simple and obvious.  Zirconium Oxide comes to mind. Why? Sand. There is a lot of fucking sand in the Middle East.  I believe that it is possible that a bit of sand worked its way into some of the ore as they smelted it and wound up folding the steel as a means to make up for it and even things out a bit, only to stumble upon something better than what they had before.  That would explain the nano-tube structure they find on surviving pieces.\n\nWith regards to the accounts from the Crusades pertaining to Damascus Steel being able to cut through lesser metals... Obviously bunk. Exaggerated to make themselves the underdogs. But, it is possible that it was strong enough to bite into and sharply dent other swords (like, swinging a cheaply made stainless steel sword onto a piece of rebar)","Umm, I think you're conflating a few things. First, you're correct that what we call damascus steel in modern parlance is more technically called pattern welded steel. However they are NOT forged the same in the slightest. Damascus steel traditionally referred to a crucible cast steel from India with an extremely high carbon content that was cast, allowed to slowly cool, then forged at a very low heat so as not to dissolve the carbide structures that formed in the steel upon initially cooling. Pattern welded steel on the other hand is simply two or more pieces of steel that are welded together and formed to shape, the Japanese did this to even out carbon content in their extremely poor iron ore and the Vikings did it to show off their craftsmanship. Now on to the properties of damascus, damascus (also known as wootz) was the absolute cutting edge of steel technology *for the time* and really only for small knives. When compared to any modern steel it is completely outstripped in every way, true damascus is extremely soft, doesn't take a very acute edge, and is fairly useless for anything but a small knife. Also, people tend to mystify true damascus as some sort of ancient lost hocus-pocus when in fact it was rediscovered how to make it way back in the 80's! If you have a furnace at home (easy to make) you can even make it yourself. And as for the \"carbon nano-tubes\" part? Yeah, any time you get graphite you're going to have carbon nano-tubes, bucky balls, and other similar structures form randomly, but this also happens in cast iron and for some reason no one ever suggests that would make a good weapon... Carbon nano-tubes are even found in soot from your fireplace, it's seriously EVERYWHERE, but it makes a good headliner and gets spread about much like the myths about katanas. Anyways, this turned into a book but I hope it helped clear some things up for you! ","I'd read that the whole reason that Japanese swordsmiths folded the steel so much was because the quality of Japanese iron ore was shit. They didn't have to fold it so much elsewhere because the iron in those places was much better.","now sell it on steam","It's a stattracker!","Surprisingly, some of the CSGO knives are worth more than their real life counterparts.","Most have been for ages.","how is that surprising? knives aren't rare in real life","same with cs:go, everyone has 2 knives","I see what you did there.

But to date, nobody has been able to replicate the forging methods to recreate the pattern you see in Damascus steel artifacts. They may have used folding, but true Damascus blades are not pattern welded. The patterns are actually a result of the way the trace elements interacted with carbon throughout the forging process. \n\nSomething similar can be achieved through pattern welding (though it isn't quite as impressive looking, imo), but anything you see today that is advertised as \"Damascus\" is really Damascus-patterned. Not true Damascus steel.\n\nThat doesn't mean modern pattern welded blades don't take an impressive amount of time and skill to produce. They do. And the one in this post is absolutely amazing looking. But labeling it \"Damascus\" is a bit misleading.","Not really, people make it out to be far more mysterious than it really is!

We can scan old Damascus steel blades to determine their chemical composition (learning what had been used to originally), but we can't figure out how it was smelted in production. \n\nWhen steel cools its molecules align in specific ways that allow it to have different properties; very fast cooling will leave the steel very hard but also very brittle, very slow cooling leaves the steel less hard but also less brittle. In sword fights you didn't want your sword to shatter in battle so this second type was preferred.\n\nDamascus steel seemed to defy those rules though, it was both very hard and flexible; which is why it was very popular and well known. And whatever process that was used to create it left an odd wavy pattern on it. We still have no idea how Damascus steel was made, but we keep finding new properties about it like carbon nanotubes inside the steel's cdystal steuctures.\n\nModern pattern welded steel resembles Damasacus steel, so people have taken to calling it that; but because pattern welded steel isn't a singular piece of steel this modern replica isn't as strong as a singular piece od similar steel would be. So it's very much the opposite of the steel it's ancestral name derivates from, but because people still associate the name Damascus with quality these blades can be sold with a large price increase.\n\nIf you're interested in how steel gets different qualities based on the environment it was formed in, or had any other questions feel free to pm me. I'm a chemical engineer who has been researching this subject with my free time, in the hope to one day bring the real Damascus steel back to this world.","You should probably learn some metallurgy first before you go about reinventing the wheel. You're talking out your ass if you're claiming pearlite makes a superior blade to properly tempered martensite. Also, do a little more research on wootz maybe? It should only take a couple seconds to find out it has already been successfully remade.  \n  \nhttp://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/9809/Verhoeven-9809.html","Maybe you should read the article you link (because I have read it).

The damascus steel is hot short, which means forging it at usual forging temperatures causes it to crumble. This matches the accounts of smiths in France/England who bought raw ingots and attempted to make their own knives out of it. Hot shortness is simply a function of the high carbon content and is similar to cast iron in that regards. The paper outlined two different methods of forging the ingots.  \n\n1. Get the ingot well above usual forging temperatures, let a thick decarburized skin form on it, and forge to shape. Then normalize the blank multiple times to reintroduce the carbide banding.  \n\n2. Forge the ingot at a dull red heat, this is probably the way it was actually done. Damascus steel iron ore naturally contained high levels of phosphorus which contributes to ductility at low heat.  \n  \nIf you actually are a chemical engineer your lack of reading comprehension is scary to say the least.

Forging involves forming steel by moving it, normally with a hammer, stock removal involves removing material to shape it.","it's kind of both. Welding makes two (or more) pieces of metal into one piece of metal via heat, and forging is reshaping &amp; tempering via heat.

Pattern welding involves folding layers in different ways of which the end result will be a very predictable and often geometric effect (hence 'patterns'). From the pattern which forms here looks more like how the crystal structure would naturally form if it had been cast. It also definitely isn't damascus steel, as this is clearly adit etching, and also the making of damascus steel is considered a lost art.\n\nFrom the wiki link: \n\n&gt;The original method of producing Damascus steel is not known. Modern attempts to duplicate the metal have not been entirely successful due to differences in raw materials and manufacturing techniques.\n\nBoth together would just be overkill, they both have a similar effect.

","And thus /r/mallninjashit is born","You've upset the mall ninjas, you better not fuck with them","I'll have to look in some more on that, but it sounds plausible. I just think that something that was a major deal in the old world being rediscovered would be a little more well known, and not be listed as a Lost Art.","Why would it be? There were a couple of articles written in the 80's when it was rediscovered, but bottom line it's a mediocre steel at best. Keep in mind most of the mythical claims about it were just that, mythical. Most of the stories you hear about it originated with the Persian traders who were trying to drive up the price enough to justify carting them across a continent. The modern equivalent, Talonite, absolutely blows it out of the water in every way. ","For multiple reasons. Namely, it's a lost art. A utility that had been the most significant thing in the area. It was more than just weapons. It was farming tools, butcher's knives, and in some cases, even cookware. \n\nKnowing the actual formula is more than just having the ability to recreate it. It's a glimpse into the ancient world. How they got the materials needed to formulate it, how it worked in their economy.  You keep going on about the \"mythical\" properties, but if the real thing was as shit as you say, it wouldn't have been so widely used and for such a long time.","I never said it was shit, *for the time*! You have to remember, most people in Europe didn't have access to good steel, and vanadium (the alloy the ore in India naturally contained) is an extremely good grain refiner, deep hardener, and carbide former. But compared to any modern tool steel of the last 100 years? Yeah it's shit. You are underestimating just how much the Bessemer Process and it's ability to precisely control alloy content in the 1850's changed steel technology. Before Bessemer your choice was either cast iron, or wrought iron unless you wanted to pay out the nose or buy from the Swiss (their iron ore had EXTREMELY low sulfur and phosphorus content) but afterwards you could turn out literally tons of steel at a time with exacting alloy contents and no contaminants. Also, could you link these bowls and utensils? I've only really heard it used for knives, swords, and a couple pieces of armor for very rich people. ","Also, Damascus steel wasn't produced in the middle east, it was produced in India. Europeans called it Damascus steel because it came up the Damascus trading road. ","Nova did an episode on Damascus blades a while back which is where i heard this statistic.  I'll see if I can track it down.  Basically the long and short of it is Damascus blades where made, surprise surprise, in Damascus.  There was a period of a few hundred years where Damascus was putting out Damascus steel blades and then suddenly the secret was lost and no one knew why.  It was eventually discovered (eventually meaning relatively recent, 10-15 years iirc) that the secret was iron containing trace amounts of... some element i can't remember off the top of my head.  Anyway, there was a mine near Damascus where all the iron contained some of the stuff, and that's how Damascus Steel was first forged in the first place.  The reason the secret was lost was the mine went dry.  Anyway, this extra element made the swords super strong.  Nowadays we have a better understanding of the actual chemical composition of steel and exactly what elements it takes to make it stronger, but back then they were just tossing charcol and iron into a furnace and hoping.  They could hold a finer edge than British blades, and Damascus Steel blades were famed for \"being able to cut a silk scarf in half as it fell to the ground\" which was not something western blades could do.  All that said, what we know as Damascus Steel today, still isn't exactly the same so it's likely there's some additive we're missing.  Comparison with genuine Damascus Blades to todays modern versions see a noticeable drop in quality compared to the old ones.\n\nYou're misunderstanding.  Yes the quality of the initial steel was terrible.  But the resulting blade could hold an edge far finer than anything westerners could come up with.  Good British blades could cut a man in half with a single swing.  Katana's however were actually measured buy how much they could cut, and merely cutting through one body would be a terrible sword.  The japanese sword testers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tameshigiri) would cut through straw, cadavers (fake bodies basically), or even convicted criminals in order to test out the swords.  A sword worth buying would need to be able to cut through at least 3 people, and the really good ones were upwards of 5.","&gt; Nowadays Damascus steel isn't really that special, but in medieval times it was arguably the best steel in the world\n\nYou comparing entirely two different things. Damascus Steel today is a completely different product then what you are historically referring to. Damascus steel hasn't been produced in hundreds of years. The present day \"Damascus Steel\" blades are just stealing the popular name and that is all they have in common. [Source](http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/9809/verhoeven-9809.html) and more info on the blades themselves.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the technique of producing wootz Damascus steel blades is a lost art. The date of the last blades produced with the highest-quality damascene patterns is uncertain, but is probably around 1750; it is unlikely that blades displaying low-quality damascene patterns were produced later than the early 19th century. Debate has persisted in the metallurgy community over the past 200 years as to how these blades were made and why the surface pattern appeared.6-8 Research efforts over the years have claimed the discovery of methods to reproduce wootz Damascus steel blades,9-12 but all of these methods suffer from the same problem—modern bladesmiths have been unable to use the methods to reproduce the blades. \"","I go more into that in my reply to the other guy.","Probably because of copyright issues ","wat","#PROBABLY BECAUSE OF COPYRIGHT ISSUES \n***\n\n##[^^^I ^^^am ^^^a ^^^bot, ^^^and ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^respond ^^^to ^^^myself.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CantHearYouBot/)","different time zones.

I like to add the sugar directly to the warm water/yeast mixture to give the yeast something to feed off of when proofing. I also knead the dough by hand so if you have any questions about making this without using a stand mixer then let me know! I knead it by hand on a floured surface for about 10 minutes, reserving 1/2 cup flour of the 3 &amp; 1/2 cups total and adding it in slowly as I knead, as to not to add too much flour. You want your dough fairly tacky.\n\nhttp://www.laurainthekitchen.com/recipes/homemade-pizza/\n\nI also like to prebake my pizza dough, brushing it lightly with olive oil and pricking it with a fork several times (this prevents excessive air bubbles) before baking. I prebake on my pizza stone for 4-5 minutes at 475 degrees F,  just until puffed up and barely starting to become golden in some areas, then add sauce and toppings, and bake for an additional 6-8 minutes or until crust is golden and cheese is melted. ","Wow, awesome advice. I always preheat my stone but never prebake my crust.  I've just started mastering the dough recipe, using yeast takes some experience, IMO, to get right.  I use the following recipe and think it would be just perfect with a little prebake to get the dough/crust nice and crispy:\n\nhttp://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/pizza-dough-recipe.html","Glad I could help! That crust recipe is very similar to the one I use, just slightly more flour and water. I think it'll work out perfectly with a little prebake! ","How did the slices fair once you cut them and lifted them off of the plate/peel/stone?

The amount was perfect for us and it cut beautifully. ","How do you form your dough?\n\nI have only made pizza about 10 times but the shape of my dough usually ends up at best oblong. I also use Trader Joe's pre-made dough, so that could be a factor as well.\n\n[This is the video/method I have used (hand formed, no rolling pin)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIJlRXMfW50)","I'm definitely no pro, and a lot of times my pizza is slightly oddly shaped but that doesn't bother me! That's the charm of homemade food. :) It's hard to explain, but I usually just pat down the dough with my hands, and then with one hand I hold it and let it \"droop\" so that it stretches, and then as it droops I rotate it in a circle to continue stretching until it forms a circle. I definitely can't toss it haha! I'm sorry that I can't explain it better. ","I understand exactly what you are saying, that is my saving move when the toss goes awry. ","That's exactly how I do it too but I've never explained it very well either.","That is absolutely gorgeous. ","Do you just use it fresh? Pizza dough always kind of sucks unless you make it the day before and let it sit in the fridge for a day.","You're right. I usually forget or don't have time the day before...\n\nSo I use [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/20171/quick-and-easy-pizza-crust/). I put it in the mixer for about 5-10 minutes and that really gets the texture of the dough right and I sub out the sugar for honey. The texture is great, the dough itself is kind of bland (which is why I use honey to add a little something to it), but pizza toppings and brushing a little garlic butter on the crust helps a lot.\n\nI use Alton Browns dough recipe if I'm making it the day before and there's definitely a better quality there.","There is a list of dough recipes in the pizza subreddit sidebar if you go take a look :)","I usually don't have the forethought to make my pizza dough a day in advance, so usually I use it fresh without any issue. On the couple of occasions I have let it sit in the fridge for a day, it turned out really well! Sometimes after the dough rises I'll wrap half of it up in greased plastic wrap in a Tupperware container then pop it in the freezer. Then whenever I'm craving pizza, to defrost I place it in the fridge overnight or on my counter for a few hours. That always turns out really delicious, too!","Ditch the all purpose flour and try it with bread flour. More gluten is more better. King Arthur bread flour is the king of all gluten. Laura knows how to stretch out a pizza dough and bake cookies, and she has some well big and shapely cans, but she's no chef.","&gt; More gluten is more better\n\nThis. Here in italy we call those varieties \"Manitoba Flour\" or \"Farina Americana\". I personally don't like sugared dough and use only 1/2  of a tsp (sic!) of yeast per kg of flour - you've got to let it rise for several hours though. This way it's much lighter on your stomach as there's no \"non transformed\" yeast left when you eat it.\n\nIf you get one of those small hi-temp pizza ovens (with a max. temperature around 400C) you can get rid of the oil too (I've got a G3 Ferrari Pizza Express from Amazon for less than €100).\n\nOPs pizza looks yummy though.\n","Do you have any advice for dough that ends up too \"bread\"? I just started making my own dough and it sometimes tastes as if I'm just eating on top of a thick loaf of bread, not the texture of dough. \n\nEdit: \"breast\" --&gt; \"bread\"","Perhaps try using bread flour if you're currently using all purpose? It'll give you a less \"bready\" crust, and it'll be chewier/more crisp. Also make sure that you're stretching the dough thin enough, as it'll rise in the oven. ","High gluten flour, let rise. Let rise again. Let set over night in the fridge. \nBring to room temp. Pizz zah. ","What about the rest of the pizza? You wouldn't leave a gal hanging would you?","Honestly the rest is pretty straight forward so I didn't post or follow a recipe, but I'll walk you through the general steps. \n\n1. Make your favorite pizza dough-- you may follow the recipe I posted or you can make another, it's up to you. \n\n2. While the dough is rising, make your other toppings. First I poached a chicken breast, shredded it, and tossed it in barbecue sauce (use your favorite homemade or store bought). Alternatively you could use rotisserie chicken, shredded homemade roast chicken, etc.\n\n3. Cook 3-4 pieces of bacon on the stovetop until crispy. \n4. Slice half a medium sweet onion and cook it in the rendered bacon fat over low heat until sweet and caramelized. This may take a while. Normally I probably would've let them get even more deep &amp; caramel colored but I had guests arriving sooner than expected so I pulled them slightly early. Still sweet and delicious though. \n\n5. Form your pizza dough, prebake it as directed, and top with your fav bbq sauce, then most of the bbq chicken (the cheese on top will protect it), some mozzarella and cheddar (or other cheeses of your choice),  the onions, bacon, and remaining chicken. Bake for 6-8 more minutes until crust is browned and cheese is melted. Garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro. \n\nHope this helps!","Thank you so much!","Try adding some ricotta cheese on the next barbecue chicken pizza.","Put it in my belly!","How do you transfer pizza over to the stone?!  \n\nEVERY single time I try to transfer it, it doesn't move.  I use a metal pizza paddle, I try to flour the paddle, brush olive oil on it, nothing works.  It ends up being a piece of slop when I start getting frustrated.\n\nI assume preheating the dough helps?  Because I usually make the whole pizza on top of the paddle and then it doesn't move.","I've yet to purchase a pizza peel but ideally you use that, and make sure that you flour the surface and work quickly so the dough doesn't stick to the peel. Blow under the crust to prevent it from sticking, too. Just shimmy it onto the pizza stone! \n\nHowever, since I don't have a pizza peel, I did it the incorrect way but it works for me! So I just took the preheated pizza stone out of the oven and quickly and carefully laid my stretched out dough onto the stone. Prick it with a fork and brush with olive oil, working fast, and pop it immediately back into the oven. After the prebake, it'll come right off of your stone and you can put it on your paddle to load up the toppings. Again I understand this method isn't correct but it has worked like a charm for me. ","I make mine on parchment paper. And leave it. Cut paper to stone size and set atop a pizza pan.  Slides easy from pan to stone and back and forth. Just watch it the dough will sweat if left. ","Try using cornmeal! My wife and I had this problem too. Now we put cornmeal on the pizza paddle/peel and then put the dough on top. This allows you to put the dough in the oven and the cornmeal will stick to the dough, effectively keeping it from sticking to the stone. We usually prebake our dough, but it has worked for when we don't prebake it either!","Lift an edge and blow under the dough.  If you are pre baking, you can fold the dough blow place it on the back half of the stone then unfold. Corn meal can also help. ","I hate you! ","I hope that the guy who cuts this knows what he's doing.","Is there a way to cut that without it ending up in a gloopy mess?","Cook it all he way &amp; give it a little time to setup after it's been taken out of the oven, but who has time when your pizza looks as good as that?","I do try to do that once I take it out, but I usually end up burning the roof of my mouth because all of those crispy toppings are just too tempting to set aside and wait for them to cool. \"450 degrees? pssh, my mouth can handle ... oh my .....!!!!\"","Like this \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nIG7rde.jpg","Ayyyyyy","That looks like a mess.

","Oki I got a whole chicken was thinking if I should cook it first then peal the meat off and put on the pizza, i just didnt wanna have it go dry on me.","You're only cooking it in the oven for 6-8 minutes so it won't dry out on you!

Bit of a tangent but a really odd thing with kids is that before they have their own income, or before bank cards could be used as Visas (and so used to pay for things online), they'd have no way to pay for Spotify or other streaming services. (Spotify is free on desktop, but the free mobile version is fairly crippled as you can't play specific songs, only play existing playlists, and there's no Pandora in Canada.)\n\nPoint is, what they'd do is just make playlists on Youtube of their favorite songs. So they'd only want the audio, but would be streaming video the entire time just to listen to music. Our daughter kept hitting her data cap and we couldn't figure out why until we uncovered that genius idea. We asked her why she wasn't just downloading music like we thought everyone had done for the last 10-15 years... turned out she had tried to do it using Russian sites. Instant malware/spyware/viruses that messed up her computer. We then had to block her from trying to download any torrents or illegal file sharing.\n\nShe ended up just using YouTube to rip the audio into new mp3s. End result was the same, but not the most efficient way to just get an mp3. \n\nAt least there was one way that the current generation hadn't surpassed me technologically.

Where someone gives their password to a 'friend' because it supports two screens, then that person shares it, etc. \n\nYou have to remember the key demo here involved with sharing Netflix to begin with, which is people that are trying to get around a measly $8-9/mo for something.

He tried to turn his swimming pool into a saltwater swimming pool since he was throwing it out that year.  \n\nIt destroyed the pump and ate away at the metal on the cheap frame since it was a $400 Walmart pool.  He tried draining the pool but poking a hole in the bottom of the pool to allow it to drain.\n\nHis next door neighbor ended up suing the piss out of him because that water drained in his back yard as well.  Saltwater just ate up his grass and he had to have the entire yard redone.","What would a saltwater pool do? ","In terms of what the guy living there was thinking?  I have no idea at all.\n\nIn terms of what draining salt water on grass and around landscaping, it just kills the soil and everything growing on it.\n\nThe guy who did it was avoiding talking to the police and the neighbor about the situation so the people living there got 3 estimates for damages and took him to small claims court.  \n\nI think he was just overall embarrassed his stupidity did that and didn't want to face them.  He promptly paid them within the 30 days after the case though.","Yeah I'm wondering why put salt water in there, do you bring it from the ocean? \n\nGood to hear he paid it promptly though! Good person with dodgy ideas lol.","No, from what I heard was he used road salt for deicing for some stupid reason.\n\nI guess he just wanted a saltwater pool.","For added fun, you can get into any printers that they have while still on your wifi, either print them a note (once printed for my buddy 'wake up Ted.

For the brother, it sounds like he doesn't suffer consequences for his actions. Now, to be fair, I am speculating heavily on the family dynamic from a third party source, but if the dynamic is as I described then I think it's better to make sure you're clear with why you're doing things ","Oh this was not the first time his brother stole stuff. He has definitely gotten punished for it several times. It got so bad that his dad put a lock on my boyfriend's door, but not the brother's door. He also had to make sure his window was locked. The only reason he got to the PS3 this time was because it was in the living room for once. His brother does get punished by his dad, he'll be grounded and he's not allowed a smartphone at all, but it doesn't matter when he goes to their mom's house and she doesn't continue the punishment because she thinks he's a perfect angel. I honestly don't think his dad even knew about the stolen PS3 and game, because by the time he asked for the Netflix password, we already had it all back. (His mom definitely knew though because we asked her if it was there). I think he only asked for the password because he knew my boyfriend was more reasonable than his brother, and might give it over if asked nicely, and he also wanted his brother to shut up about it.

Good shit.\n\n&gt;“What civilization is, is six billion people trying to make themselves happy by standing on each other’s shoulders and kicking each others’ teeth in. It’s not a pleasant situation. And yet, you can stand back and look at this planet and see…that we have the money, the power, the medical understanding, the scientific know how, the love and the community to produce a kind of human paradise. But we are lead by the least among us. The least intelligent, noble, visionary, the least among us. And we do not fight back against the dehumanizing values that are handed down as control icons. This is something…I don’t want to go off on one…it’s a lecture in itself… but culture is NOT your friend. Culture is for other people’s convenience and the convenience of various institutions, churches, companies, tax collection schemes, what have you…it is not your friend. It INSULTS you, it disempowers you…it uses and abuses you. NONE of us are well treated by culture. Yet we glorify the collective potential of the individual, the rights of the individual…but the culture is a perversion. It fetishises objects, it creates consumer mania, it preaches endless forms of false happiness and false understanding in the form of swirly religions and silly cults…it invites people to diminish themselves and dehumanise themselves, by behaving like…machines. Mean processors of means passed down by Hollywood and Madison Avenue…. How do we fight back? I think that by creating art…ART. Man was not put on this planet to toil in the mud. Or the God who put us on the planet to toil in the mud is no God I want to have any part of, it’s some kind of Gnostic demon, some kind of cannabalistic demiurge that should be thoroughly renounced and rejected….by creating art, we maximise our humanity and become much more necessary and incomprehensible to the machines! The whole thing with culture and language is that they tend to become traps. And yet, they can become the platforms for enormous freedom…if you understand what it’s all about - and what it’s all about is YOU! You are the center of the mandala. You are not marginalized in any way. The message that the culture gives us is that we are marginal. It doesn’t matter if you have 100 million dollars Fortune magazine will tell you that so do 10,000 other people on the North American continent! This is part of the democratic legacy, we are constantly told that ‘you’re not special’, ‘special isn’t special’, ‘anyone could do it’. And so then, when you look for guidance, direction, mentorship, we always look towards institutions. ‘Well, I’ll go to the university, the army, someone will give me a larger purpose’ - but it is YOU who is the final arbiter. If you keep yourself as the final arbiter then you will be less susceptible to infection by cultural illusion. Now, it makes you feel bad not to be infected by cultural illusion - because it’s called alienation. The reason that we feel alienated because the culture is infantile, trivial, and stupid. The cost of sanity in this society is a certain level of alienation. I grapple with this as a parent, and you come to this realization. What’ll it be, alienated cynical intellectual, or slackjawed halfwit consumer of the horseshit being handed down from on high?! There’s not much choice there. We all want our children to be well adjusted, it’s just that there’s nothing to be well adjusted TO! In the past 100 years as these super technologies have been developed in the West, data has been arriving about the practices of Aboriginal cultures all over the planet - that they dissolve original culture values through an interaction and symbiosis to local plants, that peturb brain chemistry. In this domain the cultural operating system is wiped clean. Something older, even for these people, more vital, more in touch with the animal soul, replaces the cultural operating system. Something not in touch with geography and history, but something writ in the language of the flesh itself. This is who you really are, this is true nakedness. You are not naked when you take off your clothes, you still wear your religious assumptions, your fears, your prejudices, your illusions, your delusions. When you shed the cultural operating system, you essentially stand naked before the inspection of your own psyche. It’s from that position, outside the cultural operating system, that we can ask real questions about what does it mean to be human, what kind of circumstance are we caught in, and what kind of structures can we put in place to assuage the pain, and accentuate the glory and wonder that lurks waiting for us, in this very narrow slice of time between the birth canal and the yawning grave? We have to return to first premises. I travel around a lot and get that jolting experience frequently, of let’s say, leaving London on a foggy evening and arriving in Johannesburg 14 hours later to a sweltering day in a city of 14 million on the brink of anarchy. I get to change my cultural operating system frequently, and so I notice the relativity of these systems. Some work for some things and some for others. You don’t have to be the victim of your culture - it’s fragile. It can be remade if you wish it to be. It can be wiped out and replaced with something else.”\n&gt;- Terence McKenna","[deleted]","no but i suggest listening to a Mono/Poly album\n\nhes like my favorite producer currently","But WTC 7 totally couldn't be a demolition, right?

But assuming you were only texting for a small portion of your trip, on the whole the trip was still probably safer than if you were drunk.\n\nDon't misunderstand and think that I'm defending texting and driving.  I'm just trying to clear up exactly what we're talking about, here.","&gt;Distracted divers are a hazard\n\nMost definitely. The number of people I see on the road looking down on their phones not paying attention to anything around then is staggering. Not only is it dangerous, they cause traffic too. More times than not, I'll be waiting at a red light and someone in front won't go. They'll be delayed like 5 seconds or until someone hits their horn. It's ridiculous. And you just know their dumb ass is fucking with their phone.\n\nI wish there was a way to know for sure, but it really feels like traffic is much worse nowadays because of so many distracted drivers. If we could figure out how much traffic had been affected over the years just by the increase of cars in the road and remove that from the equation, I have a feeling it's much worse now due to assholes fucking with their phones. Just be in stop and go traffic and watch as cars pull away and some asshole in front of you just sitting there not paying attention. Shit is blood boiling. Only job you have is to drive your car. Leave your phone alone!","Metro Detroit here. I swear every single car hogging the passing lane on the highway going 65 features a distracted driver either on the phone or holding one up. It's definitely a problem. ","And don't you just love when they realize they are being passed on the right suddenly they are like \"oh hell no\". ","In my experience they're never even aware of me giving them the stink eye or the thumbs down when I pass them.","I honestly forgot that the thumbs down was an option for me whilst driving. My middle finger is just much faster I suppose. Don't have to rotate the arm form the shoulder. ","I usually give a thumbs up with a really excited look on my face.  It's passive agressive, but if someone does the whole road rage want to fight thing, I may be able to play it off as \"I was really impressed by your cutting me off while eating a burrito\".","I like the thumbs up smile and when they look flip it down and give them a pissy look. Fun stuff.","I just stick my tongue out at people like a five year old. ","I wish I had 10' arms and reach in their car and bitch slap them.","No need to get violent.

It's actually pretty rare now that I see a cell phone while driving.\n\nIt's not that hard to fix the problem if the police enforced it\n","You can't solve a people problem with technology.  Implement harsher sentences and they'll have a tough time texting and driving while they're in jail.  It's not like self driving cars will be cheap or people will be forced to use them.","Isn't it a ticketable offense?  It was in Vancouver and I think NYC.","Yeah but I never see anyone get pulled over for it. There's an initiative for state troopers to pull over people going slow in the passing lane mid-state here though, that's about it.","It's enforced here in a sneaky way... the cops will setup on a long straight commuter road hiding behind a tree with a telescope on a tripod.  They can see the phone users about 5-6 blocks ahead... so lots of chances to catch people. ","Depends on the state law. Some states it's only a secondary offense, meaning the cop can't pull you over for it they can only cite you for it in addition to a 'real' offense. \n\nLooks like Michigan leaves it up to local ordinances to decide to ban or not.\n\nhttp://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/cellular-phone-use-and-texting-while-driving-laws.aspx","There was a post or comment a while back where some guy stopped at a red light and noticed the girl next to him texting. So he decides to step on the gas to trick her into thinking the light turned green. He stops immediately,  but she floors it and slams into the car in front of her. True or not, that was very satisfying to read.","Yeah, but think of the poor sob who just got rear-ended.","I've done something like this unintentionally in the past. I honked for the person in front of me stopped at an advanced left turn arrow. The person to the right of me drove into the car in front of them.  \n  \nI pulled off the road after my turn and waited for the cops so I could make a statement. Turns out the girl's excuse was \"Someone honked at me and cars were moving so I went\".  \n  \nSince then, if someone is on their phone beside me, and not looking up at the light, I roll forward slightly. It's great when they catch the rev and see me moving and, without looking up, they accelerate through the red light.  \n  \nEdit: I should also mention how much better this is at red light camera intersections. Also that we have closed circuit cameras at high collision intersections. They could pull video of the person on their phone as they roll through the red light.","As a fellow Michigander(Traverse City here), I have to ask: do you ever angrily fantisize about the cops busting those assholes, then giving em gigantic tickets that all go towards fixing the roads?","Ah but do you ever pass when opposing traffic is present?

I actually don't like driving even though it would be basically required where I live.

When they think computers, they think their phone or laptop. Would you trust your PC to drive your car?\n\nA better idea of the reliability would come from computers that run the power grids or communication networks.","I've been at red lights while staring at the light and taking my foot off the brake the second the light turned green and have had people beep at me for not magically being on the other side of the light yet.

I literally could not believe my eyes, she thought I was such a danger to the road that she had to turn around while going 70+mph on the freeway to get proof of my \"dangerous\" driving. Yes I was speeding (probably was going 85mph by the time I managed to pass her) because I was in a rush and it likely did nothing to save me time so I *was* in the wrong, but she could've caused a huge accident all to satisfy some petty grudge. \n\n\nAnd all for what? Let's say she decided to go through with giving the pic to the police, what is she going to say? \"This guy was speeding on the freeway and cut in front of me so I turned around and got a pic of his face, go arrest him.\" Firstly a photograph wouldn't be able to prove I was speeding or cut her off (and I only cut her off because she was adamant that I couldn't get in front of her) and secondly I doubt the police would be able to use it to file any sort of charges. At best they would stop by my address and talk to me or let their officers know to watch out for my car but that's about it.

I can't really see it as shaming when the NHTSA twitter account is replying to people who posted on twitter, a public forum, that they had been texting and driving. You can't really get shamed being called out in public for something you just admitted in public an hour ago.","Honestly, I don't know what the right way to solve the problem is. I think it's complex and can't be solved with just one easy solution. I think part of it comes from changing the approach to tackling the problem, changing public perception, and also introducing technology that will make texting during transit a non-issue (like moving towards consumer vehicles towards an automated driving). ","That's all entirely fair, and seems pretty logical to my mind too. With the advent of new technology and usage of it, it would only make sense that it takes some time to sort out appropriate response. Having been on scene at too many car accidents, regardless of cause, I can say risking one is really rarely going to be worth it, and probably never worth it for texting.

In the US it is too easy to get a license and too many people overestimate their abilities because of this.\n\nIf I could have it my way:\n\nTesting and requirements would be higher and no driving under the influence because I do not think people can properly judge their abilities under the influence. Causing an accident would be punishable. Speeding without an accident would not be punishable(there is no victim). Speeding while causing an accident would be a crime worse than just causing an accident by simple mistake because it was more reckless. The more risk you take the worse it should be punished IF you fuck up.

I understand I can't have a perfect world and my way may never happen or even may be a terrible way to do it but that is my opinion on how it should be.

I can understand talking on the phone hands free or maybe adjusting a phone that's on a mount that keeps your eyes up but not texting. ","Look, (in response to a few other replies) I don't think anyone here is debating the legality of what the cop is doing (i.e. if it's illegal, it's illegal), but the basis on which the law itself was made. Banning all cell phone use in a vehicle, no matter the state of the vehicle is a knee-jerk reaction. Suppose the drivers in that video were just tapping on their car's touchscreen or GPS instead? Same level of distraction, but not the phone--should interacting with the car's screen be outlawed too? Even at a stop?\n\nLet's not pretend that looking at your phone at a stop light or in a stopped traffic jam *is the same thing* or *presents the same danger* as checking your phone at highways speeds for 10 seconds at a time. The law in question is a blanket measure.\n\nThe example you give is so specific and requires so many more variables (and driver fuck-ups) that it's pretty obviously a bad basis for comparison. The fact of the matter is, if they believe they should start moving forward, they should put the phone down, look around, then proceed when it's deemed safe. Just because some asshats continue to stare down when they start moving, doesn't mean looking at a phone while stopped is *intrinsically* dangerous. It's a faulty comparison.\n\nDrivers who creep without checking are guilty of a shitty driving habit and would creep alike anyway if distracted by checking a car's GPS, picking up a dropped food item, reaching back to check on a kid, etc. If creep is the concern, it's not the phone that's the issue, it's the driver's behavior and their lack of checking in front of them before proceeding.","It's not comparable to messing with the radio that is mounted to the car. Those have large knobs and buttons designed to make them easy to use without looking at them, and they're bolted down so the buttons are always in exactly the same place. Changing a radio station is also much simpler than sending even the briefest text.\n\nAs for GPS units, yeah, I'm pretty sure messing with those while driving is illegal, and should be. Those things are just as complicated as phones. That's why every one I've seen warns you not to do that when it starts up.\n\nI agree that creeping without looking would probably still happen if phones didn't exist, but it would happen a lot less. Your radio and GPS are designed to minimize their distraction from the drive, and usually don't need to be messed with more than once at the start of the journey. Phones are designed to grab your attention with buzzing and flashing lights, and this happens often and at random intervals.\n\nAnd it's not just about the creeping. Everyone here seems to agree that inattentive drivers at the very least inconvenience the people behind them by needing to reacquaint themselves with their surroundings before moving again. Thus is frustrating for you and I but for emergency vehicles, if they have to give every other driver an extra few seconds to put the phone down before moving out of the way, they will not get where they need to be in time.\n\nThere are so many cons to texting behind the wheel in any situation. Potentially big, life changing consequences. And the alternative, putting your flashers on and pulling over for 60 seconds, is so insignificant, that touching your phone at all while in traffic is immensely selfish, childish, asinine. It's indefensible.","&gt;No, you can't. \n\nYes, you can.\n\n&gt;Even if you're stopped, you have to be aware of pedestrians crossing on front of you, \n\nWhat are pedestrians doing on the freeway, crossing away from intersections, etc?\n\n&gt;cars behind you, \n\nIf you're stopped in traffic there is literally nothing you can do about the cars behind you.\n\n&gt;etc.\n\nOkay then, how about let's rip all of the accessories out of all the cars.

There are no laws against it in my area.\n\n&gt;What? You're stopped at an intersection, where there are typically crosswalks. You need to be aware of pedestrians in the intersection EVEN if you're stopped.\n\nNot everyone gets their own intersection, in the video, the officer apparently cited drivers who were far from the intersection, that cannot possibly be for the safety of pedestrians who may or may not be in the crosswalk.\n\n&gt;But making texting and driving illegal deters the crime from happening. So it's still a benefit. \n\nMaking texting and driving illegal creates a new citation which was already covered by existing law. It undoubtedly catches many innocent drivers who were not texting, and were not endangering anyone, therefore harming people unjustly while not having the desired effect on public safety.\n\nPlease consider this perspective from a TC article:\n\n&gt;&gt;*As we've noted there are lots and lots of things that can distract a driver which are still considered perfectly legal, such as changing the radio station, talking to passengers, eating, etc. Trying to ban each and every distraction one by one is a ridiculous and impossible task. In fact, studies have suggested that bad distracted drivers will often just find a different distraction to occupy their time. And, thanks to these laws, those drivers are often still texting while driving, but are simply holding their phones even lower, taking their eyes further off the road, so as to avoid detection... actually making the roads more dangerous. The real answer is to focus on stopping bad driving, not trying to call out specific activities.*\n\nhttps://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20130405/02103822591/california-court-rules-it-illegal-to-check-maps-your-phone-while-driving.shtml","Good luck, mate.

And, thanks to these laws, those drivers are often still texting while driving, but are simply holding their phones even lower, taking their eyes further off the road, so as to avoid detection... actually making the roads more dangerous.

If it's not, then yes there should be enforcement of the limit.\n\nThe more grey area, personal discretion/interpretation, and inconsistent enforcement there is, the greater opportunity exists for abuse, bias, and ill-informed civilians.

Suddenly there's a huge burden of knowledge on citizens to know all the corner cases (I mean, even more so than now). In the case of speed limit signs, it would be much more confusing to convey the intent of the law if they have multiple conditions and if they change every 100m.

Change the speed limit every time there's a hill or a turn?\n\nWhere I live we have suggested safe speed signs for curves, hills, intersections, and other potential hazards. The only difference, besides not saying \"speed limit\", is that they are yellow rather than white.\n\n\"Speed limit\" is exactly that, the legal limit for your speed. It is not a suggestion, and it is not recommended to always go that fast.

It could be raining so lightly you don't even need wipers, or it could be a downpour with slick roads. It could be dead night with no moon or barely dusk. I think these complications are better left to a court of law, and it seems that most countries agree. But I'm all ears if you have a compelling paradigm shift for speed signage.\n\n&gt;The only difference, besides not saying \"speed limit\", is that they are yellow rather than white.\n\nWell I don't know about where you live, but where I live, yellow speed signs indicate a suggested limit that is not legally enforceable.","[deleted]","lol. \"Safely handle\" includes other cars, not just the capability of an individual.

I think the US just needs MUCH more strict driving tests administered more often than \"the first time you get your license.\" I'm not sure, however, that you can pass that strict of a test when you first get your license in order to start learning your limits, and a test environment tends to halt a lot of these behaviors where the bad driver says to themselves \"oh, it's fine. I know exactly where that car is and I'm not going to hit them.\" or \"oh, it's fine, I'm great at multitasking and I know exactly what's going on around me\" because they don't make the assumption while someone else is watching them with the authority to take away their right to handle a vehicle.

Now everyone behind has to slow down slightly, which amplifies due to reaction time coupled with the smart-ass on their phone that doesn't realize the need to slow down until they are on someone's bumper, then they hit their brakes, causing a traffic jam that builds and slowly ripples back through traffic, becoming worse and worse as time progresses. All of this avoidable if people left gaps large enough for vehicles to safely merge into their lane, people not trying to go faster than the car in front of them then slamming on the brakes, and drivers not distracted by cellphones, passengers, pets, or sun glinting off an airplane over the horizon.  \n  \n  \nEdit: Here's a shockwave traffic jam explaination: https://youtu.be/Suugn-p5C1M","So why is it only Houston?

So many different things a cop can do to provide tons of evidence in court that you can't get around.

A text may show up on a phone record, but data is too difficult to forensically pinpoint being used when there's so many background things going on at once on the phone. If you don't want to unlock your phone, they can't get in to check any logs or what was used or what apps you have to figure out from those providers what you were using. \n\nSo you pretty much just have that a cop is 90% sure he saw you on your phone for a split second when driving by. MAYBE someone else thought they saw you. There's no hard evidence. So how do we solve this?\n\nSurveillance cameras *everywhere* monitoring cars all the time. Maybe some sort of intrusive software that tracks your phone usage while it's in the car.

The Soviets found that sniper duties fit women well, since good snipers are patient, careful, deliberate, can avoid hand-to-hand combat, and need higher levels of aerobic conditioning than other troops. Women were regarded as having the skills and nerves required for accurate marksmanship. Notwithstanding male skepticism, Major General Morozov, “the father of the sniper movement”, attributed superior female marksmanship to the fact that “a woman’s hand is more sensitive than is a man’s. Therefore when a woman is shooting, her index finger pulls the trigger more smoothly and purposefully”.  \n  \nThe most successful Soviet use of snipers during the second world war were during their defensive stages of the war (1941–1943), after which the advantage of defense shifted to the German side and German snipers became a real danger to the advancing Soviets. Soviet military doctrine used snipers for providing long-distance suppressive fire and for eliminating targets of opportunity, especially leaders, because during World War II, Soviet military leaders and combat theorists (Vassili Zaitsev contributed greatly to Soviet sniper doctrine, although he was officially neither of these) found that military organizations have difficulty replacing experienced non-commissioned officers and field officers during times of war. They also found that the more expensive and less rugged sniper rifles could match the cost-effectiveness of a cheaper assault rifle given good personnel selection, training, and adherence to doctrine.  \n  \n","&gt; Total number of confirmed kills: 775 \n\nNo doubt these women were great soldiers, but keep in mind the Soviet numbers were often inflated for propaganda purposes. Just look at [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_snipers) and sort it by \"Confirmed Kills\".","Sometimes \"the claims of Soviet numbers inflated for propaganda purposes\" really gets on my nerves. Are the Soviet numbers really that badly inflated compared to other armies' numbers? Simo Häyhä (which appears on reddit every other day) is often cited as having almost ridiculously many confirmed kills, even though A) Finnish snipers didn't use a standardized spotting and confirming system during the Winter War and B) Simo Häyhä was a media celebrity already during the war, which makes stories about him highly susceptible to patriotic inflation.","Agreed, my history teacher often did this in highschool and he would put any Soviety advancement down a notch with some sort of wild claim. For example, he mentioned that they stole the designs for the Space Shuttle rather than just recreate it using pictures.","It's always healthy to be suspicious towards wartime propaganda, and *especially* that of totalitarian regimes such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, but sometimes it feels like the age-old stereotype that Eastern Europeans in general and Russians in particular are a faceless horde of slow-witted peons, incapable of any achievements beyond enduring copious amounts of stress and mindless obedience, is all too much alive in the world today.","\"Kills\" is even pretty misleading. Typically they would count it as confirmed if someone else saw the hit, usually the spotter. \n\nHitting does not equate to killing though and you are not going to find someone to run over to the enemy territory to find out if the guy you just shot is dead or not. ","And atop all those Russians, just to spite them, Simo Häyhä with the exact number of 505.","Which is probably also wildly inflated but he's not a Soviet, so this is not mentioned...","Finnish TV did a documentary movie about him, where they said that in reality he killed something like 200 people.","Still a decent K/D","Not even counting assists.","AKA kill steals in War Thunder","Simo Hayha was a hero who did all that could be expected of him and more in defense of his homeland.

Thought confirmed meant that it's found to be 100% true.","If I remember Chris Kyle's book correctly you need to actually see them die. So if you shoot a guy in a window and see him go down, it's not confirmed because you could have shot him in the shoulder. Need to find the body or confirm in another way. \n\nAlso I believe confirmed kills require a witness/signature. So solo sniping makes confirmed kills difficult. ","Snipers usually have a spotter with them. A kill is confirmed only if executed in the presence of another soldier who witnesses the kill. Carlos Hathcock and other prominent snipers probably have higher kill counts than what is confirmed, because a kill is only confirmed by a witness.","Thanks, that makes sense.","That means that he shot them and probably killed them but no one actually went up to the body and confirmed they were dead.","The dead targets got better?","Even if it's inflated, it bears to remember that he was active for only *100 days* during the Winter War, whereas the Soviet snipers on the wiki page were active for several years.","... Which really says more about the incompetence of the Soviet command during the Winter War (to present such a huge number of easy pickings for Finnish marksmen) than gives any indication of Häyhä's skill compared to Soviet snipers during the war against Germany.","every time somebody suggests this, people always try to counter with, \"no you see he was ugly so it has to be true\"","I don't know, I don't think it's that unbelievable for a sniper to kill five Soviets a day during the Winter War. They weren't exactly elite troops. The Soviet numbers are more dubious as all kills would be against the Wehrmacht. ","Well, on the flip side of that Hayha was active for like 4 months or something vs. (potentially) years for Soviet snipers. The Red Army was also massively larger than every other military in the ETO, and had the whole \"cult of the sniper\" thing going on, so it wouldn't be surprising if quite a few of the top scoring snipers were soviets. ","Well it's about ratios right? If the Red Army if fighting an enemy that about the same size, then it is less likely that one person would get a high amount of kills. It was also far more difficult to get a kill when fighting the Germans than it was fighting the 1939 Soviets. The Soviets generally lack credibility as in many instances it is blatant that they are lying such as [Vasily Zaytsev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Zaytsev). The Wikipedia article on him is a mess of \"citation needed\"s and his principle accomplishment detailed in \"Enemy at the Gates\" is killing a German sniper that doesn't exist. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that Simo Haya  had a lot of training as a member of the Civil Guard. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Finland had much of a propaganda machine. ","Well the Finnish Army didn't use a standardized spotter and confirmation system for their snipers during the winter war (and finnish 'snipers' were actually more like marksmen, i.e. regular infantrymen who were selected by officers for their marksman skills. In other words: lacking any kind of 'formal' sniper training *unlike* the Soviet snipers). Also, all the figures I've seen of Häyhä's kills have been from Finnish wartime media, and anyone who thinks that Finnish media during the winter war *didn't* contain a fair share of inflated jingoist fables for morale purposes is pretty gullible.","Man that page always freaks me out. So much killing.","Finland. Be afraid ","[So badass that Sabaton made a song about him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLTpKs2ylP4)","Germans inflated their fighter and tank aces figures just as bad but probably worse (look it up) and yet I only see comments like these on the Soviet ones. To be fair, Simo's record was questioned below you, that's quite impressive for reddit.","Same goes for Americans if we really wanna blame everyone who padded their stats. Hitler really liked the idea of having 2 tank divisions instead of one. Even if that meant have both divisions be at half strength, just so it would look good in the 'War room'.","Makes you wonder how it must feel to know that you atleast killed 100+ people.","Well, they also fought 9/10ths of the German army in WW2...","What is a Guard Sergeant? Wiki says nothing about it. ","The Soviets designated units with distinguished service the title of 'Guard'. That designation was added to all officer titles too. In this case it means a sergeant in the 59th Guards Rifle Regiment (21st Guards Rifle Division, 3rd Shock Army, 2nd Baltic Front)","did shock armies have more armor? like say a panzer army vs a regular German army?","It would have depended on the year and the army in question. Shock armies were the units designated to make the most sweeping advances during attack phases so early on in the war (1941-ish) they often attempted to consolidate more mobile mechanized and armoured equipment, but just as often they utilized light rifle brigades. There was also a preference for heavier artillery to help smash though German lines during the advance, but again it depended heavily on what could be spared at any particular time.\n\nIt was only really the middle-years when shock armies received priority access to heavy armour and artillery. By that time they were used to make the initial breakthrough while medium armour and infantry exploited deep battle doctrine.\n\nBy the end of the war shock armies were only really different in name since it was easier and faster to transfer specialized units between armies than move the armies themselves. That becomes particularly true once specific tank and mechanized armies began to form from 1942 onwards, leaving shock armies less able to exploit breakthroughs by comparison and relegated to combat in areas tanks were less suited like cities or as rapid combined-arms support to the tank units. ","Shock Armies were basically purpose built for large scale engagements, you would be correct in saying they were provided with more armor, but they are not like a Panzer core vs a Wehrmacht infantry core. The Shock Armies had tank and infantry units within the, It was a combined arms unit, more mechanized than your average Red Army group, more tanks, more artillery, and a hell of a lot more trucks, they were used to try and hit large German forces and shatter them, hence the \"shock\" name. This one in particular went through Warsaw, had action in Prussia, in eventually would be the major force in taking Berlin.","&gt; Shock Armies were basically purpose built for large scale engagements\n\ncompared to what? what else would armies be purpose built to do? occupy territory? or does your comment mean offensive-only large scale engagements (not concerned with defensive operations)?","You misunderstand, I'm talking about large battles for the Eastern Front. The largest battles in human history were fought during this time period, normal armies were meant for engaging units similar to themselves in size. Blitzkrieg changed all that by grouping tanks together as opposed to distributing them as support for infantry, so tanks would move in concentration and fight decisive battles with the support of shock infantry. Shock armies were the Russian counter, massive in terms of size and strength, the Shock army meant the Germans couldn't exploit a weak point in the line, if they tried to launch a major offensive, they would be met by a huge, well supplied, well supported army. the concept was modified t be more offensive as the wars tide turned, or at least thats what Zhukov has said of it in his books. What happened at these decisive battles would direct what happened across the rest of the front. This doctrine was mostly based on the gigantic engagements the eastern front had, and was a mostly Russian concept because the other Allies weren't managing a front that massive, and for the most part, weren't fighting battles this big. The Shock Army doctrine fell out of use after the war because wars just *havent been that big since then.*(thank god)","My guess would be a Sergeant in a Soviet Guard unit.

The eastern front was a far more brutal war than the one the British and Americans fought. Roughly 27 million Soviets died during world war 2. More than 10 million soldiers and another 10 million civilans died during the fighting. 6 million more succumbed to disease and starvation.

It happened more often early in the war, Stalin ordered any man who retreated to be shot in one order call \"Not a step back\". But as time wore on, even the most fervent Stalin supporters realized it was not advantageous to be killing your own men. Some commanders at Stalingrad were known for killing their own men, and some for sending men into combat unarmed or without ammo, but this is overplayed in most media. In reality, the problem was there were few competent officers early in the war due to Stalins Purges, hence why the Russians suffered so greatly in the winter war. As time went on in the war, good NCO's and CO's started to rise up in the army for bravery and zeal, and you'll notice at the end of the war, the Red Army was extremely competent, with most of their massive losses and captures coming at the beginning phase of Operation Barbarossa, when millions of Red Army soldiers were captured and sent to camps where they would not survive.","Not at all.

If he is able to pull 'most' than it will be a literally unprecedented shift.\n\nhttp://www.mediaite.com/online/how-bad-is-poll-that-says-25-of-bernie-sanders-fans-wont-vote-for-hillary/\nhttp://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/sanders-backers-have-easy-choice-in-potential-clinton-vs-trump-matchup/","“Don't fight for what you believe in, that's what pussies do. You should back the candidate who's the embodiment of everything you dislike instead!”\n\nTotally makes sense.","I voted against her twice already and I'm still constantly called a shill if I ever say anything that's not completely negative about her. ","How do you vote against someone? \n\n","probably referring to voting for Obama in '08 primaries then voting for Sanders this year. ","By just giving your vote to someone else. Most people today don't ever seem to actually vote *for* someone, just against someone else.","You don't. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯","There's dozens of us. LITERALLY DOZENS","lol I love how your comment is controversial just because you hinted at supporting hilary. You didn't even say her name or post anything negative.","Dozens of us on reddit, and apparently enough to win the nomination and general election outside of it.\n\nBut for real though, I can't wait to see how this election turns out. /r/politics basically shifts into being an anti-Hillary subreddit anytime she wins a state... so like every few days. I can't wait to see what the sub looks like in September or August. I'm also pretty curious to see what role Bernie Sanders will have after the convention, if he'll become a Clinton surrogate for party unity like what Hillary did after Obama was nominated. I wonder if he'll end up getting a higher end position in her cabinet, his message is the future of the Democratic Party--it's just that Hillary and Obama are the present. I can't wait to see how things turn out.","I'm predicting that /r/politics will either become a Trump subreddit, a Jill Stein subreddit, or at the very least a #neverHillary subreddit. She is the penultimate example of everything the average millenial hates in politics, I just don't forsee the subreddit turning in her favor.","It's always going to be cancer, the default subs always are. I think Clinton supporters might become the silent majority, or a group of Bernie supporters to say, \"Bernie is my first choice, but Clinton is alright I guess, she's not an awful second choice.\" Which is basically how I thought from October to a few weeks ago.\n\nIt'll become a war of Trump v. #FuckTrump. I don't see Jill Stein becoming popular, she's too far left for most Democrats who like Bernie, she's too far left for most Independents who like Bernie. She'll attract her club of people, but the Green Party hasn't accomplished much of anything ever. No senators, no congressmen, ect. Even the Libertarians have had Governor houses and the occasional seat of power somewhere. If she becomes popular then it's just going to be 2000 all over again.\n\nOn a side note, what has voting 3rd party every done? As a protest vote no one in history has ever heard or considered that protest. It's never forced a political party to change or take notice. It would make a lot more sense voting against the guy you don't like and then in the off-season dumping money into people like Bernie Sanders who by all means shouldn't vanish and trying to get something like the Alternative Vote system in place. From there you can vote out the establishment parties without fear that you're really weakening your Left or Right leaning candidates to fall easily to the opposition.","Not true- the populist parties of the late 1800's and early 1900's caused a huge shift in the politics of the day that we can still feel the effects of, and even before that, the Republican party started out as a third party in the fairly well established \"Wigs vs Democrats\" contest of the day, and when the Dixie-crats broke off from the Democrats, two \"third party\" parties essentially caused the civil war. \n\nNowadays, of course, the parties are much more entrenched than they used to be, and we should get rid of the first past the post voting system, but don't count out the sway of third parties.\n","Politics was removed from being default because of how cancerous it has always been","The silent majority that's voting clinton are 65+ older folks who don't know much about the internet yo. Not sure on the exact number if it's between 55+ or 65+ but I know it's been proven time and time again she's really *really* unpopular with anyone young. \n\nCaucus voters are not representative of the overall majority, it takes someone really invested in politics to go to caucuses, and a lot of free time to go there in person. Most people didn't even know what a caucus was in the first place. \n\nIMO - I don't even think it's her fault on being despised by the young, there's a rising tide of hate against politics in a nutshell and she happens to be a person that falls into the stereotype perfectly, like the poster child for corrupt politics and shady businesses. There's thousands others that are far far worse than Hillary, and if they had run - they'd be the ones hated right now, not Hillary. She's just happens to be in the spotlight.","I'm probably going to end up voting for Jill Stein anyways, but even if it becomes a Jill Stein sub, I'm unsubscribing. This election is terrible and I'm just done with it already.","Hey mazu74! Looks like you are talking about unsubscribing, that's ok, but we will [miss you](http://i.imgur.com/MXz64Pn.gifv).

If bernie is out then Kasich is DEFINITELY out","At the core this is a very personal question so any objective answer is impossible. However for myself since I view the Democratic primary as pretty much over she is the candidate closest to my views that actually has a decent chance of winning. Ideally I'd like to see Sanders turn down his attacks to build party unity but to stay in the race and begin focusing on using his funds to build a strong organizational backbone to identify and support future progressive candidates at local, state, and federal levels. ","Well, she's the only candidate running with four open federal investigations.","Just four? Hah, what a casual. Real politicians should have no fewer than a dozen.","I'm not a huge fan, but I end up supporting her because of all the bullshit thrown her way. I've never seen such blatant disregard for due process, sources, skepticism, as these past few months. Literally any source is seen as legitimate if it's negative on Hillary.

REALLY?\n\nIf she were as bad and as crooked as everyone says, you could do better than that.","Haha, the wordpress blogs crack me up.

From my point of view her campaign is at fault for this reaction.","Sanders has pumped way more money into social media marketing. His camp just claims that they don't specifically target comments so it's totally cool. \n\nAnd people were calling anybody who didn't shit on Hillary shills since way before that story came out. ","No that was a pro Hilary super PAC that announced such plans. Super PAC's are seperate entities from official campaigns. Although that doesn't mean Hilary is necessarily against what the PAC is doing, she isn't the one in charge of what they do or don't spend money on.\n\n","&gt; she isn't the one in charge of what they do or don't spend money on.\n\nOh, ok then. She's probably ok in that case.","This campaign is from David Brock's SuperPAC, the one where they found a loophole that allows them to coordinate with the campaign. So you really can't claim she has nothing to do with it, any more than we can claim that she does. Nobody knows.","You are not quite right about that:\n\n\n&gt;Due to FEC loopholes, the Sunlight Foundation’s Libby Watson found this year that Correct the Record can openly coordinate with Clinton’s campaign, despite rules that typically disallow political campaigns from working directly with PACs.\n“SuperPACs aren’t supposed to coordinate with candidates. The whole reasoning behind (Supreme Court decision) Citizens United rests on (PACs) being independent, but Correct the Record claims it can coordinate,” Watson told The Daily Beast. “It’s not totally clear what their reasoning is, but it seems to be that material posted on the Internet for free—like, blogs—doesn’t count as an ‘independent expenditure.’”","And Bernie has paid [Revolution Media $16 million](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/4/22/1518673/-Bernie-Sanders-employs-online-trolls-via-Revolution-Messaging-They-are-still-hiring) to do the same thing. ","It is not a disregard for due process, it is a distrust of due process. When observing Hillary's lifetime in politics, there is evidence that time after time, the Clintons seem to be obviously tied to some ethically questionable activity. And, time after time, they beat the wrap. This confirms the notion that the rich and politically well connected are elbows deep in one another's pockets, and this entire rigged system never changes because they all profit in the end. And this profit comes at the expense of the poor masses - especially those who can most easily be convinced to vote against their own interest. IMHO","Oh come on, there is so much legitimate criticism, e.g. her not releasing her Wallstreet transcripts.

They have different interpretations of these rights, but they both would agree with the statement \"human rights exist\".  Not every classical liberal interprets human rights the same way: even among the founders of classical liberalism like Adam Smith and Volatire there were ideological differences.

I wonder if he'll end up getting a higher end position in her cabinet, his message is the future of the Democratic Party--it's just that Hillary and Obama are the present.\n\nYou could very well be correct about this, but I don't think he's going to go down that quietly. I can see him running as an independent. Think about it: a lot of people are terrified of a Trump vs Hillary election. He could not only campaign as an alternative to either of them, he could market himself as the killer of the two party system. Obviously one election won't kill the two party system, but if he can associate a vote for him with an act of rebellion against the status quo, he could attract a sizable number of voters. IMO, this is the perfect storm for a third party candidate to get elected. The only way this could be better is if Bernie's economic platform was more moderate.","Bernie Sanders isn't a Democrat, he doesn't really have the motivations to keeping the Democratic Party together like Hillary did in 2008. But, he's the most liberal politician in the Senate and I don't think he wants the Republicans to sweep the White House. He personally said he'd support Hillary if she wins the nomination, and recently he said he'd need to look at her platform to see if he'd consider supporting her (he doesn't know her platform, really?) I'm guessing before he decides he'll sit down with Sec. Clinton and talk about how things are going to go down, maybe she'll adopt some of his platforms and he'll endorse her.\n\nOtherwise, he'd probably run as Jill Stein's VP. He won't go independant, I don't think.\n\nIf Trump himself goes independant and its: Cruz vs Hillary vs Trump vs Bernie this could be interesting.","That's true, the threat of having Trump as president is probably more of a risk than he's willing to take to win. I know he said he would back her, but with the stabs he has taken at her and the things he has said about the DNC makes me uncertain as to what he'll do. I can definitely see Clinton taking some things from his platform, specifically the emphasis on ending the \"War on Drugs.\" I wonder if she'll try to make him her VP to attract some of his voters...\n\nA Cruz-Trump-Sanders-Clinton four way deathmatch would easily be the most interesting elections we have ever had. If I wasn't so opposed to having Trump as president, I would love to have that happen.","Not american, but that last bit is what I want to see.  Seems like if that happened and each got a decent amount of votes, serious election reform would have to happen b/c it would be blatantly obvious that two parties is not enough.","I have to agree. If somehow it becomes those four guys running it would implode the current voting system we have.

And they are talking like he's already in the white house.\n\nNot a comment on who should be in the race or voted or whatever.","The last thread made me finally filter out both subreddits, so I'd say it did a little good","&gt;Donald has openly advocated war crimes \n\n what exactly are you referring to?","He advocated killing families of ISIS members (civilians) for one","http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/3/donald-trump-says-hed-force-us-military-commit-war/","Water Boarding ","He said water boarding doesn't even go far enough. \n\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/02/17/torture-works-and-waterboarding-doesn-far-enough-trump-says/uz8uWHo7BZ83cm5Tm53oxM/story.html","_HIGH ENERGY_","Low effort, low energy post. Uncle Donnie will be disappointed. ","I think Sanders has a better chance against Trump than Hillary does","You're welcome to believe that. But I have two arguments against that. \n\nOne is that even if it where true that Sanders is more likely to beat Trump he's not likely at all to beat Clinton. Outside of Clinton having charges brought against her or some other disaster she's extremely likely to be the nominee. [Betting markets currently have her at 96% chance of winning the nomination.](http://predictwise.com/politics/2016-president-democratic-nomination) Which have historically been quite accurate at this stage. And if Sanders runs third party he basically hands the presidency to the Republicans. So whether or not Sanders can do better against Trump is kind of irrelevant in my mind.\n\nAnd secondly polls showing Sanders beating Trump can't be taken seriously this far out. For one thing Sanders winning independent voters in the primaries  doesn't mean much because independent does not mean moderate. It's the independent moderates that are what are really fought over in the general election. And then we have the issue that Clinton has barely attacked Sanders. In the general he'll be smeared non stop and you'll see any polling advantage drop real fast. I mean for god's sake [Sanders spent his honeymoon in the Soviet Union](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/12/george-will/george-will-reminds-readers-about-bernie-sanders-u/) I can barely imagine how much that would be twisted against him and that's just the tip of the iceberg of things he can be attacked on. ","if that happens, I think a lot more sanders supporters are gonna go to trump than the party thinks. \n\n if they were wise, they'd use their superdelegates to give the nomination to sanders","Wait if what happens? If Clinton wins a majority of votes they should give the nomination to Sanders? I mean any rational person would agree that if she's actually charged with crimes than giving the nomination would absolutely be the right thing to do. \n\nBut if Clinton isn't charged with any crimes than the Democratic Party must absolutely honor the will of the majority and nominate her. And I'd say the same thing if Sanders was winning. \n\nWe could talk all day about alleged voter suppression but like it or not the polls have closely matched the results in all states except Michigan where Sanders won. You are suggesting the disenfranchisement of millions of people who actually did go out and vote more than those who supported Sanders. That's not simply unreasonable that is disgusting. \n\nAnd the Bernie or Bust crowd is similar to the PUMA's of 2008. A vocal minority who where ironically in support of Clinton. What ended up happening was the vast majority fell in line. I expect the same to happen because as a candidate Clinton has much more in common with Sanders than Trump does.

If you're paying a worker 10 dollars per hour to peel and core and slice 3 apples per minute (extremely optimistic estimate, although im making shit up here) you're paying ~5.5 cents per apple. If the machine costs 750 dollars  and 15 cents per hour to run, it basically pays for itself after 40,000 apples (by my drunk math that I was unable to recount how i arrived at the conclusion to), or 120 hours of use. Of course the amount you're profiting off of the cored and peeled apples affects this too but excluding that I'm fairly confident that my math is wrong. If anyone wants to correct me go ahead, but until then I'm pretty sure this machine is a great investment.

It may take roughly 10-12 seconds to peel a single apple, but the machine is doing 3 apples in parallel. I counted 4 seconds between him putting each apple on(which is where I got 12 sec from, 3*4). That means it can do 15 apples per min, much faster than a person. It is surely cost effective, it is just is big as hell too. ","i mean what kkind of use do you have for an industrial (can we pump more power into it to speed it up? i'm sure you could increase the motor speed and potentially profit per time spent running with a better motor) apple peeling/coring machine where the space it occupies is going to be a limiting concern? im not making this argument from a household perspective, unless someone's mom is trying to peel the next year woht of apples for them in a single night, in which case the space issue is likely a nonfactor again regardless. if i owned a business that needed apples cored and peeled and could sell them faster than my employees could peel them i would definitely be investing in this. who knows","Yah, it would have to be an extreme need.

I'm just guessing here, my memory is foggy going back that far, but I think it was about 75 apples a box, and I'd finish that in about 5-7 minutes.  After you're done all that I'd end up with an extra step where i'd go over them with a knife, sometimes rough, sometimes precise, depending on whatever needs were.  that would only take an extra 1-2 minutes.\n\nthat's probably between 7 and 9 apples a minute.

Of course, every now and then you get a ripe bit that just won't co-operate but i bet that kind of thing would muck up the OP's machine too.","how hard would it be to repurpose an existing machine and modify it slightly to be able to load the machines up. If you had 100 of these machines and 3 or 4 people supervising an automated system that would load these apples into a machine (we're assuming that you already have people loading the apples for the machine's human counterpart to begin with) i can easily see the machines being more efficient.
