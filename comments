Lol the campus cop half-heartedly chasing the slowest stoner
that slowest stoner was me. i outran him, barefoot.

photo of me circa 2007 under that parachute on a different day/photo of me now
http://imgur.com/a/Kgysy
You delivered, fucking A1 

Also, why did you go back? 
was holding a bowl and my phone in the same hand. dropped them both. went back for the phone (incriminating evidence), came up eye to eye with the officer, executed a ? pattern on foot. lost my shoes. didn't stop.
Did you get your birkenstocks back?
no :(
So you grow your own now? Colorado?
i'm general manager of grow operations for a colorado dispensary :)
Which one buddy?? I'll stop by sometime
Look out dude it's that cop!
Rocky Mountain High!
American Dream my friEnt!
Did he never see you again or he just never bother to do anything with you if he ever saw you again? 
he came to my dorm room the next week looking for my roommate and didn't recognize me. i had long hair at the time and when this all went down it was up, when he came by later it was down. needless to say i still almost had a heart attack when i looked through the peephole at him standing outside my door.
Damn You lucked out then, I would be panicking like crazy. Do you know what happened afterwards, anyone get in trouble? 
2 girls got popped from a photo on a camera left behind. they just had to do some community service. 
There goes my hero
&gt;the slowest stoner


a new heartwarming uplifting childrens book coming next 4-20 to a headshop near you
And its sequel "The Little Stoner that Couldn't".
"and didn't even try"
I cannot stop laughing at this for some reason.
is it because you're an underachieving stoner who doesn't try? :D
Smoked daily for half my life, until recently. Now I'm just an underachieving person who doesn't try. So yeah, basically 
he was actually pretty early out, but for unknown reason runs back. Maybe he was gonna get something or figured he could hide under the parachute, which I'm certain someone did
definitely went back and grabbed something off the ground. 
the actual dude appeared in the above comments (provided photos for proof) and said he dropped his phone, so he had to return to grab it
For some reason that reminds me of the time a friend and I were baked and we're twirling around the yard singing a whole new world, some dude came walking down the alley so we dropped and figured if we just lie down as flat as we could he wouldn't notice us. 
 "I'm thinking if I get into bed and I get real low and flat and then you're underneath me or on top of me, you know, they won't see us."

"What—how—how does that work?"

"OK, well, see, here's the problem. If I get all balled up and small, I get too high, and you'll see that there's someone in the bed. Now the further and wider I go"

"Uh-huh."

"The flatter I become, like a starfish, you know?"

"But what in the hell are you talking about? Why would we wanna look like a starfish?"
maybe it was his parachute and he tried to take it with him
He's asking himself "Where's the damn fat one?"
Honestly if he's like most campus cops I knew they weren't really into busting kids for smoking. Distributing, sure, but if you got caught smoking and there wasn't a camera they'd throw it out and warn you. He is, after all, basically their employee. 

I'd suspect his primary goal of moving them away from the tour group (and parents) and secondary goal of scaring the shit out of them was accomplished perfectly.
Seeing as how nobody was caught I don't think anyone got scared shitless and everyone had a good time overall with a laugh and a story instead lol
It's like a fucking clown car! I didn't expect there to be that many underneath it.
I was picturing just two inside, for some reason.
I expected a circle just about, like 8 or 10 or so. And I've watched this shit before too, damn my memory is shit. 
Ya know, I've heard that smoking marijuanas can cause short term memory loss and even short term memory loss. 
You can tell how it is because how it is
How neat is that?
They don't think it be like it is, but it do.
That's pretty neat
I think you've been spending too much time under the parachute.
I was just surprised there wasn't a bigger cloud that escaped with them... 
That's honestly what I expected to be so amusing about the video. Generally a let down though. 
And then the cop sees the *one dude* who *miiiiight* not outrun him, so he starts lumbering haphazardly in that direction. 
Hey, the cop was making a token effort. 
I did. Seeing videos like this taught me well.

Chimps film stoners getting caught smoking under a parachute.
I think the cameraman has the Reefer Madness.
Will someone call a doctor already! The cameraman is having a seizure. 
Probably just zoomed in so far that the smallest movements look like Romulans are firing on the camera man. 
I assumed it was filmed during a chimps tea party by the laughter...
Was it not?
That dudes laugh made this video. That and all the people looking like cockroaches that skattered! Hilarious. I totally didn't expect that many to run out. /r/Unexpected 
Stablized version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwgHkZ9pdxU&amp;feature=youtu.be
I like how the stabilized video just disappeared into a black hole while trying to stay still.
I think it's trying to escape the narrator's voice
That guy's hyena laughter makes me mad
"Fuck it, I don't get paid enough for this, I'M OUT"
Thank you. So much. I was getting angry watching the original. I can chill now.
tell me about it, i was getting unreasonably fucking pissed off
I kept my cool. I pictured Michael J Fox filming 
Thank goodness. The original was like watching a video taken by Michael J. Fox on moon shoes in an earthquake. Now it's like watching a video taken by Michael J. Fox on moon shoes in an earthquake while I'm tripping on LSD.
bless you
This was in 2007, in my home town.  Today's paper has [an article] (http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20160420/NEWS01/160429993/0/FRONTPAGE/Remembering-the-%E2%80%984/20-Parachute-Stoner-Dash%E2%80%99) with some "where are they now" and fun interviews
Wow. There seems to have been some success stories out of that parachute 
"Smith was ticketed and required to do community service. These days, she runs one of the largest marijuana companies in Colorado: Rocky Mountain High Dispensaries."   
  
No surprises here. 
"Now a vice president of an insurance agency that specializes in insuring cannabis grow shops’ products, Schield said she laughs every time she watches the video."
"Dan became addicted to heroin shortly after and died from overdose at the age of 24" Well shit.
wow there seems to have been some success stories out of that parachute

but for real, a primary source actually connected to the story? This should be much much higher, higher than me even.
I remember when this was first posted (myspace I think?), I was in high school and we tried to steal the parachute from the middle school to re-create this awesome idea.  I'm surprised that the top comments aren't about how long this video has been on the internet haha, it was extremely viral.
[deleted]
Dude 
Police are bothering people who smoke weed, but the camera man had a stroke and nobody helped.
It must have been hard having a seizure while an earthquake hit.
Everything changed when the earhquake and seizure nation attacked. 
Sounded like a chimp having a fit.
He was hysterical lol
this is a piece of stoner history right here﻿
You might say, it's a relic of the stoned age.
Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this.

Edit: Oh heck, I can't believe it's not butter.
[Obligatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X6VoFBCE9k)
Perfect timing, how about [Those points](http://i.imgur.com/kUaYszn.png)
Simply beautiful. Last winter, a campus officer caught a group of students doing the same thing in an igloo on my school's campus. Unfortunately, it isn't as easy to escape from an igloo as it is a parachute.

Edit: [Apparently it was two years ago.](http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/27/justice/utah-university-pot-igloo/) 
Wow they tore down the igloo too, that seems unnecessary.
It's Utah. The stoners are lucky they weren't stoned.
&gt; Apparently it was two years ago.

Bro, these stoners were in a [Quinzhee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinzhee), not an igloo!
And it happened at my local college! This Fort Lewis College located in Durango, CO. Its a legend on campus.
I saw this video almost a decade ago.  Probably one of the best reposts of the year, its been a while.
they scattered like roaches
except the one idiot at the end who went back to presumably get his stuff, and was probably the one guy to get arrested. 
Makes sense if it was his wallet with ID...
Or his weed
Report it stolen
report it stolen 
You can see the cop makes a second appearance near the end, empty handed. Idiot got away! 
A happy ending.
heh roaches... it's funny because that's what you call the unsmoked remnant of joints.
Huh, we always used the name roach for the filter where im from.
You smoke joints with a filter?...

Edit: guess I was misunderstood. I've always referred to them as crutches like you guys are. I was under the impression everyone was loading their joints with a cigarette filter or some shit.
Nah you fold a little bit of cardboard or something and it holds the end open and provides a bit of space between the weed and your mouth.
That is called a crutch in my area.
Crutch, filter, roach, are all acceptable. 
We called it a splint.  Yours are better though, I think.
we call it a tip.
We call it a Fleepborapong, well I call it that. 
In Britain they call it the jointy pointy, in Germany they call it the Weederrollenholden, in Russia it calls you.
We call it a little bit of cardboard or something and it holds the end open and provides a bit of space between the weed and your mouth.
I've actually only heard people refer to the little stub you're left with at the end of a joint as the roach.  Crutch or no crutch.
In Québec we call it a "cut" as in "cut of cardboard/carton". 
Yeah, thats what we've always called a roach. Some king skins come with a pad of roach carboard attached for that reason. 
It's why I love Raw papers
I just rip off the cover part on my papers anyway
I use the little books of raw crutches
Fucking right, it keeps the resin off of your lips and let's you smoke it all without burning your fingers. 

Edit (clarification): cardboard filter. Not a cig filter. 
i know where i am from literally everyone uses a filter, or as it is commonly referred to here, a "crutch." 

We would just fold and roll up a piece of an index card. That way you can hold the J easier, and smoke it fully down to the end without an issue. It also usually smokes a lot easier and burns even throughout the whole thing.

When i got to college people were shocked to see this, so apparently it wasn't as common as i thought. 
It's like those baby spiders that ride on their mom's back and then scatter *everywhere*.
Yeah, reminded me of a spider being smashed into lots of baby spiders too. Like this

Holy shit smoke some weed camera man to calm those shakes.
Unfortunate that nothing can be done about his screeching laugh...
I don't usually put my headset in. You win some you lose some. Guess I won this one.
you call _that_ winning??
He didn't put his headset in, so yeah, I'd say he won.
I thought it was funny.
Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado for those interested. What a proud relic for my alma mater.
Yeah. That's right next to my old dorm building. I wonder what year this is. I'm thinking it's like ten years ago, or more.
i think i saw it first about 10 years ago.
Uploaded in 2007, so ya pretty much.
Fort Lewis:  It's sort of like college.
It's got many nick names. Fort Leisure, Fort Lewis High, Snort Lewis. What a school.

oh, guess that's why.
1. This video is oooooold

2. Marijuana use is legal only by 21+ and only in private residences
You're telling me that a makeshift parachute home isn't private residence anymore. What is the world coming to.
This is my own private domicile.
and I will not be harassed.... BITCH
Not in public first of all, just like alcohol, and not 10 years ago. 
Cause the video is old. 
Cheers fellow Skyhawk!
There are dozens of us!
We are the dozen that actually graduated.

Currently enrolled. The cops turn the sprinklers on now just before 4:20 pm
I expected it to be two stoners under a parachute
Takes more than two people to hold down the edges and make a decent air seal. They must have been hotboxed as fuck in that thing.
Someone needs to stabilize this video.  Watching it was torturous.  

I still watched it though. . . 
Done  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwgHkZ9pdxU
I don't know what you're talking about,

Video ^fineTHE

Was

We never did this with the parachute in kindergarten.
Its funny how old "viral" videos give me a nice feeling of nostalgia now 
Yeah it's long enough ago that it's not 'oh this again', but rather 'oh wow it's been so long!'

I still make sure to watch bootleg fireworks at least once a month though.

EDIT: How did I miss the date...
One of the highlights of my life
I would hate to be that guys friend and have to listen to that god awful laugh on a daily basis.
I feel like they missed a great opportunity there to wrap the officer in the parachute.
From this distance that cop looks like Lahey. 

I hope at least some of those runners yelled "frig off" as they got away.
The shithawks were circling.

I sometimes think that the best of stoner innovation is in the past but then I see a bunch of college kids hot boxing a parachute and my faith in stoner culture is restored. 
Not sure what your definition of past is, but this video is 9 years old.
let me check

ok, i can confirm that yes, 9 years ago *is*, in fact, the past
The remix
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqzliObVDvc
This is awesome with the maniacal laughing behind it! 
Really nice to see Michael J. Fox branching out in to camera work.  Whatever you gotta do to stay in the business right?
That freak out at the end; I've never been excited like that for anything in my entire life.
"let's go under the brightly colored parachute in the middle of campus so no one will notice us" - stoner logic
I mean the plan was probably to scatter and it worked, and honestly they probably only got bugged because of the tour
That dudes crazy laughter got me lol

HAPPY 420 YOU SEXY THANGS
I am pretty sure this was filmed by Joker with parkinson.
[removed]
Give that camera man a drink before he rattles apart.
OP has Parkinson's.
No OP is Jello
never gets old
I mean, I guess smoking under a parachute would be a plausible thing to do during a magnitude 9.0 earthquake.
Was this filmed by Michael J Fox?
Florida?
Happy 420!!!!
This is so old but pre gold! perfect to watch again on 420!
Stop masturbating and the camera won't shake so much    
I think it's great that they let the kid with Parkinson's hold the camera.  Very all inclusive.
I love it whenever /r/trees is leaking [6] 💚

Happy 4/20!
And a happy Hitler's birthday to you too!
If I were a security guard at this place I could not imagine in a million years that i'd care so much about this that i'd chase someone. 
Did Michael J Fox shoot this?
hook me up with a trimming/harvesting position
Haha, they are stoners, they must like STONES xD!

Obligatory edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger! RIP inbox XD!
Are you okay?
just a little paper rolled up to keep the wacky from getting in my throat.
Literally everyone does where i live. In Europe, that's the standard.
The standard across the entirety of Europe? 
Of course in my hometown.
I love the cloud of smoke as the parachute opens and hate the fucking shaking of this camera, was as unstable as a person running down the road. 
repost. Still funny, like a bunch of newborn spiders spreading out from mama﻿
That was so funny the cameraman went insane.
Whoever's filming sounds like a devil's spawn...
This totally belongs on [/r/contagiouslaughter](https://www.reddit.com/r/contagiouslaughter).
[Relevant](http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF258-Honk.png)
He should've stuck his butt in there and farted 
::laughing intensifies::
Isnt it because its mostly the roach (filter) that's left?  If you collect your roaches you can roll a shitty joint from em.
Haa That's some funny shit!
Maybe that was just his "4/20" laugh 
it's a good thing the camera man had Parkinson's 
This was taken at Fort Lewis College in Colorado. Pre-legal marajuana obviously.
&gt;I feel like they missed a great opportunity there to ~~wrap the officer in the parachute.~~ assault a police officer.

Don't let your dreams stay dreams!
That would be assault.
Who does a campus tour on 4/20 in Colorado?
Unfortunately the guy holding the camera is a jackass, so you can't really make out how it goes down.
..whoa
"Today on videos that really need image stabilization..."
I love this guy's laugh!
do they get caught though? DO THEY??!! (reecedes into shrubbery)
Thanks for the answer :D
That cop is convinced he's gonna get one of them.
Michael J Fox was holding the camera
hats off to ya, mate! if you're hiring, by chance, I could be persuaded to come out west and pay ya a visit or chat with ya on the interwebs. I used to be in sales, if ya catch my drift. 
Networking at its finest
not every day you get a chance to talk to a legend or get a job you loved back

You know they were like okay 1....2....!!!!!!! Also that guy filming was so hysterical you'd think he was high on meth
Stoner with cam needs more dope for his severe tremors.
a "fucking clown car?"  the internet has ruined me because now I'm imagining a funny porno, filmed on wheels.
The crutch?
Yo dawg! I heard u like watching stoners
(insert Benny Hill music)
A nice happy ending.
I hope they get shot.

Why is that any of your business?

I get by just fine like this.
If you say so.
What you don't believe me?
Do you think I'm fucking lying? Huh?
Is this Fort Lewis in Durango CO?
They're fairly interchangeable
A lot of that top shelf grown for dispensaries leaks out into the black market. So there's a chance you grow my weed because I only toke that piffy piff.
This would make a great gif

Anyone?.....anyone?
it's funny, up until you realize that any of the students caught will probably be removed from school + charged
HEY LAHEY, FUCK OFF!
This was in 2007 at Fort Lewis College in Durango, CO. I was friends with all of these kids in the dorms. I was invited to join but figured it was a bad idea. Turns out it was.
Crap never even occurred to me that this is still illegal for kids under 21.
Video is 9 years old.
Sadly none of them "got away". One of the kids under the parachute dropped their phone, which had pictures of everyone under there. I think just about every single one of them was reprimanded in some way.
was this filmed at a parkinsons clinique?
[deleted]
what kind of engineer? it's a little tough right now. standard is to start at the bottom and work up.
So the only one on campus NOT stoned is the cop. 
Everything that isn't now is the past 
The future is not now, nor is it the past.
Cameraman had a seizure while filming. Maybe that's why he needs to smoke.
Dude should get checked out for parkinson's, he can't seem to hold his hand steady.
This video makes me nauseous.. were you tweaking on meth while recording this OP?
Ah. Much like the lion, the police officer chooses the straggler as his prey.  
I am really surprised to see that this far down.  If I heard that guy in public, I would have to punch him.  I wouldn't be happy about it, but I really cannot stand the noise escaping his flappy fucking word hole.
I'm surprised the top comment wasn't about muting the fuck out of the guy, or replacing his voice with sexy saxophone dude. 
You punch anyone  with an annoying laugh/voice? I take it you don't go outside much Mr. Neckbeard.
Looked to me like he was trying to grab the paraphernalia that was not grabbed in the initial scatter. Cop was keepin an eye out for contraband and followed the appropriate MVP.
I don't have to outrun the cop. I just have to our run you! 
One of my old high school buddies is in this video!! He showed. It too us during his first summer back from college in Durango Colorado. 2007! The recorders laugh is still just as awful....
it's like the opposite of /r/ContagiousLaughter. it killed my enjoyment
I was wondering why the parachute was staying up so well.  I guess it wasn't just the hot air!
Imma need to check your sources
Damn man... learn how to hold your phone still. That video almost gave me a seizure.
God, you would think Micheal J Fox was holding this camera.
So is this comment I'm writing. Did I blow your mind!? 
The camera man was Michael J Fox
i'll never forget the first time i ever saw this. i think it was on ebaumsworld or something like that and i was probably 10 and to this day its still one of the funniest things I've ever seen
Older than that, youngling.
Seriously, juggling the camera would have been steadier.
Watch this on mute.
"SCATTER!!!"
Did u get the parachute back
no :(
thieving bastards!
this is like the first youtube video...classic tho
This is my school!! Fort Lewis in Durango. Wish I was doing that instead of crushing finals
Jesus fucking christ could his hands be any more shaky.  
Whoever took this video needs euthanized for the good of the species.
lol, you guys are talking about the same part, essentially. It's just the end of the joint where you either reach the filter or just run out of enough space to hold it and/or it's just really resin-coated paper at that point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OZ40fPvhjk
Who handed the camera to Michael J Fox?
Kevin Bacon, your not so bad.
did they trace you back from the DNA scraped from the birkenstock?  /s
Why did the guy with Parkinson's end up holding the camera??
I expected like 4 or 5 people to come out, wasn't expecting **FIFTY.**
Feller Canadian?
Sweden, its standard practice here, aswell as using tobacco to blend it out a bit and also we dont really do blunts or bongs that much.
Yeah Europeans always trip when they come to Canada and learn that we mostly roll without tobacco.
Looks like a spider with many baby spiders riding on its back then you hit it with a slipper.

http://i.imgur.com/yg6w5KA.gif
But it will come back clean, whenever that is. 
Don't you kids use "roach clips" anymore?
The highest person in that video is the guy filming.
This guy laughs like when Bob from Bob's Burgers when he is going crazy.
Little slow on the uptoke.
This video is like 10 years old. Way before legalization. I remember seeing it when I was in college. Hilarious either way. 
How did they train that chimp to hold the camera so steady?
Obviously - the training didn't do very well. 
The Dudebros recording lmaooo
Any Washingtonians here? I'm just going to do this in my house today.
I expected a thick cloud of smoke to come out when he lifted it.
IIRC this is one of the oldest videos on the Internet. I remember seeing this shit years ago. 
Internet is almost 25 years old in terms of popular use, doubt they had a camera and uploaded the clip to the Internet back then. There were like 10 videos clips available back in the 90s

Hell, it wasn't until after 2000 that video clips started emerging in mass, which is why YouTube wasn't invented until half a decade later
There were more than you think. Back when .avi and .mov were the go-to options. Usually links on an angelfire or geocities page in the mid/late 90s. 
What about the parachute?
confiscated :(
Why would you hang around to try and get the parachute, just run dude 
the camera mans need to smoke some weed to help with his parkinsons
Now I know there's such a thing as a punchable voice. 
no fucking shit Sher... oh.
This was at my college! FLC represent!
"Waaaah hahaha wahaha WAAAAAAHAHAHAHA RAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHA" - camera man
That isn't a cops job though... Also, Isn't it illegal to smoke weed in public?
Yeah, alcohol is legal, but you still can't booze it up under a parachute in the middle of a college campus.
You went to the wrong college.
EVERGREEN STATE BABY
I go to ASU and we still can't drink anywhere on campus. Or in our dorms.

Technically. 
I've been to campuses with bars in them
Outside? In the middle of the quad?
I think usc had it in a quad. But csulb has one basically in the middle of campus 
Hey, they were IN ColoRAdo, for pete sakes.
My campus is a wet campus and I go to a Catholic university.
Yeah, private schools have different policies. That's the exception rather than the rule, and isn't really related to the point I was making anyways. 
I really want to know what was happening under the parachute aside from passing blunts
People remarking on how fucking hot it was.
Wouldn't you just need to keep the booze in a brown paper bag, so it wasn't obvious you were drinking in public?

Obviously the cops and everyone else know you're drinking booze, but that way they can pretend not to know, and you can pretend to not be drinking in public, even though everyone knows it. 

Seems like there should be some sort of similar compromise between the laws and common sense about smoking pot as well.
My college was a freerange marijuana zone. You could smoke anywhere on campus and no one would bother you. Every picnic table outside every dorm on campus had a constantly rotating group of people smoking there all day and night. The substation was right in the middle and there were campus police ever present yet I never heard of anyone having to run away like there future depended on it (because it would have). Dealers were often arrested but even that I personally think is wrong because it has to come from somewhere and we didn't have dispensaries yet. I think it's different than drinking in public because it isn't hurting anyone while public intoxication can often be deadly; when not practicing moderation of course. 

I think my campus, being a self-contained city, really goes to show that utter chaos does not occur when there is marijuana smoke drifting up into the sky all over at all times of day. Friday and Saturday nights though were sometimes hell because of drunkenness but it was the greatest form of hell.
Not in my campus you see people drinking beer and smoking weed in the department cafeteria in the middle of the day. 
Stay out of the teachers lounge!
They weren't in public, they were inside a parachute building.
We have an obligation to break unethical laws. 
hahaha
[deleted]
Well yeah, laws don't apply to people who don't understand them... Everyone on Reddit is a damn attorney it seems. 
You and I apparently have different definitions of public. People completely concealed from view are hardly "in public". And even if they were not, who cares? It isn't like seeing a couple of kids smoking in the park is going to ruin anyone for life with thier awful evil. 

Until there are places where one can legally hangout and smoke (or better, vape) with folks, I think you can safely consider no smoking in public laws optional, especially when it is entirely okay to go get hammered in a few thousand bars and restaurants. 

Just be sure to wear your running shoes if you don't live in a decriminalization / legal state. I'm in Mass, so you just need to be willing to part with $50 if caught. 
You go get hammered in a few thousand bars and restaurants. Second you walk outside and not into a cab, you get Public Intoxication. And this video was taken on a Public University so yeah, it is still illegal to consume illegal substances on Public University Property. 
Thought that was CU Boulder at first but I guess it isn't! I went to CU from 2007-2011. In 2007 the famous 4/20 celebration started on Farrand field and as it started to gain traction they tried turning on the sprinklers to deter people. The attendees pushed their water bottles down onto the sprinklers causing a flood in the system and damaged the sprinklers. Then by about 2008 hundreds and then thousands of people started the regular celebration on Norlin quad in front of the library. They stopped ticketing people and police were just there to keep the peace. 

By 2011 I was over it and my friends and I would go up the flatirons to smoke overlooking all of Boulder. It was beautiful and way more serene than joining the masses at Norlin. It was pretty cool though we hotboxed the outside. 
It was 4/20 though.
Huh?
It was a 4/20 celebration, just not at CU
Oh yeah I got that! I remember this video when I first started going to CU and from then on I was a stoner until I graduated!
If you're gonna take a video.. Shut the fuck up and stay still. 
like cockroaches
It looks like he stopped and went back for their pipe or maybe the sack of drugs lol.
SVAVGE.
RETK
Why would they let Michael J Fox hold the camera...
that freaked me out [7]
That wasn't even funny because this dude wouldn't shut up and let me watch. 
Haha
Dude sounds like a hyena
I watched to see the smoke plume. Was not disappointed
Lol 
His laugh reminds me of the, "Pull up your pants, faggot!" guy.
Good lord you sound like a bunch of rabid hyenas! 
Fe, Fi, Foe, RUN !!!
"The North American stoner is a peculiar creature that often habitates in groups; this particular community is feeding on a gaseous form of cannabis whilst taking shelter from the circling predator outside. Upon sight of danger, the pack flees in all directions, confusing the predator and allowing the group to escape in the ensuing chaos. Similar survival tactics are used by many species of fish to confuse and alarm would-be attackers."
Seems pretty childish.  
That had to be the most infectious laugh I've ever heard. I love it.
;/
That's unlucky, good to see that you escaped tho. OP has delivered 
"Grab his throat and groin, come on rookie!"
that was a dude filming? i thought it was some sort of rambunctious tropical bird.
http://imgur.com/zef3zIT
I went to this school, and lived in the dorm this was filmed from. Ft Lewis college everyone hahaha
Should have had another officer waiting by the vending machines.. Rookies. 
Durango, Colorado. My friend was in that parachute. He said a lot of people got caught because they left behind wallets and cameras when everybody ran. 
I'll verify all those statements. 
A predator naturally going after the weakest in the herd.
That laughter was so annoying
Are you nuts? With legalization stoner tech is exploding! Fire is for savages. Vapes, dabs, oils, and tinctures are all the rage. They have weed sex lube that will in fact get you high. I weep a little every time I'm with folks that hit it old school by lighting weed on fire to get at the goodness. 

Legalization and decriminalization is awesome. I'm so pumped for every state in New England to flip in 2016 except for the supposed, "Live free or die" state of New Hampshire. 
Worst. Cameraman. Ever. 
Props to Michael J Fox for his stellar camera work. 
Looked to me like he ran back to get the weed.
Is the guy that took the video a hiyena? 
For some reason that makes me more angry.
Have you ever witnessed a spider egg hatch?  It's kinda like this but way less pleasant in my opinion. 
[Fucking repost](http://i.imgur.com/klvqWEM.gifv)
Considering that laugh, it's more likely to be Michael J. Chimpanzee.
Its the little things in life that can sometimes bring us the greatest joy. 
That was a stoner taking the video?  I thought it was a vibrator.
Me too.  I imagined him puffing away on some medical marijuana.
He meant Mexican car.
Shit man im sorry to hear about the crebral palsy.
dat shakey cam though
This is at Fort Lewis college in Durango! A very good friend of mine goes there. This was like..a year or so before it got legalized?
Yep, think it was only when we had mmj sales. Good to see someone realizes we're here ;)
Nobody gets caught vaping anymore.
Popped for what? Possession? 
I mean its incriminating the school could have drug tests done or just say hey guys do community service and we wont care about this.
Or a spiders nest.
That was nearly ten years ago, and all I can say is that either you were under that parachute on that day, or you were not.

It's my life's big regret.
WHS 4 lyf 
Do you know why they call it a 'roach clip?'      

Because 'pot holder' was already taken.

I have motion sickness from watching this horseshit video.
At least Michael J. Fox was there to film.
lol campus
This was like 10 years ago
That is some mental fucking laugh.  Holy shit i almost got scared. 
This video is so old that what they are doing is now legal where they are at.
Is Tweek filming this?
It's said that to this day, the cameraman is still laughing. 
Nah man, it's full of roaches and he just turned the light on. 
Did the person filming this have parkinsons?

Did Michael j fox film this?
you came too late
/r/instantbarbarians
Degenerates, inhaling the improper particles.  LOCK THEM UP.
Okay anyone else think this guy laughs like Vash the Stampede?
This was CU-Boulder, right?
Fort Lewis College in Durango, CO actually
AH! that's funny the hills in the background made me question my question before I had even replied. I think the first time I saw this it was labeled as a Colorado-Boulder thing incorrectly.

But if it was Boulder, that whole field would have been full I'm sure, haha.
CU-Boulder, actually. Sucks to be a CSU Ram.
Damn it. For some reason Colorado University didn't sound right in my head.
It is still said university of colorado, but just abbreviated cu-boulder.
Bandwagon homosexuals. Happy birthday hitler!
Upvote because this had me rollin (¬‿¬)
Hold the fucking camera still and stop hollering like an idiot, you fucking stoner cunt.
It's the tour group watching that just kills me, and probably why the cop realized, "Oh shit, probably should pretend to do something!"
I love the fact that they all ran different directions.  That shit was hilarious.
More like that spider sack I accidentally opened in my backyard.
I like this one.

FUCK NOW EVERYONE'S GONNA REPLY WITH SPIDER VIDEOS I REGRET EVERYTHING.
[Everyone on reddit right now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiTHDIWAWU4)
Oh god that's literally me every time. Although it's much easier with a vacuum with a really long nozzle.

That ending was amazing.
What is he saying and why doesn't he freak out as much as I am freaking out right now?
"As filmed by Michael J Fox"
http://i.imgur.com/pLURO87.gifv
Holy fucking shit, was Michael J Fox filming? what a SHIT video. someone mind stabilizing it?
Whoever was holding the camera really needs to get started on treating that early onset Parkinsons.
I feel itchy
I think both of you need to climb under a parachute and chilllllllllllllllllllll out, man
If anyone here see's a wolf spider in their basement, try your best not to kill it. They eat almost every insect and pest that may also live in your house. 

Plus look how [cute they are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_spider#/media/File:Lycosidae_female_carrying_young.jpg). And yes those are babies.
Camera needs more shake I can't see what's happening
There's a special circle of hell reserved for people like you.
I didn't mislead anyone into it though :(

I clearly stated what the video was.

I'll be honest, I barely watched it myself. I just googled it, peeked through my fingers for half a second. Screamed a bit, then posted the link here!
The balls on the one guy trying to grab the parachute before the cop starts chasing him.

...Waiting for the stabilized version of this with the blackhole effect
Did Michael J Fox record that video? Jesus Christ...
"Half heartedly?"

Cop was so pissed he couldn't inflict his authority on someone, he didn't know which way to run.  
Was Michael J. Fox filming this?
Holy crap, I would have shit my pants 
Who gives a shit if it's a repost, it's still one of the funniest videos I have ever seen. Never gets old. 
That laugh was awful and annoying but then I realized I was laughing just as terribly and boisterous as the camera guy.
yeah, like 10 fucking years ago  
 
this is in CO, you fucking assclown
That's what Halle s when you smoke that **DEATH**. 
it really wasnt that bad lol

gave it character
Those stoners are like a bunch of ants running from a kid with a stick.
On top of that, the laugh is just ridiculous. 
Classic
Your video gave me vertigo.
Wasn't this a loooooong time ago?  Feel like I watched this in high school 2001
2007, almost ten years!
omg. i thought there'd be three or four, not forty. it was fabulous!
Instantly thought of [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQbq3TtWT0)
Protip: You can steady a cellphone camera by pressing it against the frame of the window you're standing right in front of.
I hope everyone is okay after the earthquake that was clearly happening while the camera person was recording.
Major buzz kill.
True 2007 YouTube video quality
Sorry about your parkinsons
I got seasick watching that. Take the phone off the nervous guy next time. 
His laugh just went crazier and crazier...
Eh hes just breaking them up for the tour group
Ah, the old ? Pattern. The most legendary evasive maneuver.  
How else would they have kept the parachute down?
Fantastic username you made right here
Reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrNluXrrHKY). No one helped that woman.
I am more concerned about that everybody survived this earthquake
i don't think the camerman cared he was having a stroke. haha.
Don't have to be fast - just faster than billy
That man needs a fucking tripod, god damn.

I love how the cop just kinda speed walks at first like "I didn't expect that many."
Again?  They went back and did it again?
We are all stoners on this blessed day. :)
[Repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1tybk1/cop_catches_teens_smoking_pot/)

And I'm also reposting my comment: The cop could have decided not to see this. Or not to become a uniformed pig in the first place.
Roaches everywhere like we forgot to take the trash out -Future
There must have been at least 15 marijuanas under there.
The old ones are the best... never fails to make me giggle!
Kind of looks like he tried to grab the parachute. "Hey man I know you've just busted us man but I realllly need this parachute, man."
Stoners=Anyone who smokes?
So much for that safe space
Scurrying roaches caught smoking roaches.
What an unsettling laugh. Dude should audition to be the next Joker. 
maybe he just wanted a friend to talk to :( 
Does the guy recording have Parkinson's or something? Hold the camera still!
It's like that video where border police stops a car and a bunch of immigrants start jumping out like fucking clowns from a clownmobile.
why didn't i think of that!?!?
LOL I was reminded of this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf9LhPQTfBY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf9LhPQTfBY)
Why would he need help, were his arms broken?
This is an extremely underrated joke an up vote for you sír
Can someone stabilize the video? 
That's like ''fun times of your life'' kinda stuff!!
Did he travel the campus matching shoes with princes?
I was getting sick 
This is crazy. I want a tent
I just want to relive my favorite kindergarten game of throwing the ball up in the air with one of these parachutes
I loved that shit. And the little square roller boards. Damn.
[Dude](http://i.imgur.com/x8KePbY.png)
He didn't have a stroke, he just saw some street magic.
The real crime here is he can't hold a phone steady enough for 2 seconds.
apparently whoever recorded this was having a seizure 
Holy shaky cam Batman!
I didn't know orangutans could film video. Well at least that explains the shaky ass video 
Does this video come with dramamine?
Did you save the bowl?!?
"I'm more worried about whether or not everyone survived this massive earthquake.﻿"

My sentiments exactly!
Whats funny is I'm stoned right now
.. That many? Dude. I thought there was just one person in there Lol.

It makes sense to invite more people though so there's more joints contributing. 

I just don't smoke pot so it didn't hit me till they all ran out. 
Awww... when dreams come true. . :-)
Ha ha ha, what a retard
Umm, proooobably not a good idea to post those two photos together...
it's all legal. the future is now.
But it was illegal when the photo was taken. Wasn't there a clause to deny licenses to those with priors? Wouldn't be too surprised if they could apply that retroactively.
First photo doesn't show anything incriminating though
The video doesnt show anything illegal, its just *assumed* what is actually happening. Also neither pictures appear to be illegal, because in CO weed is legal. Also our justice system has a pretty thing called the [statue of limitations](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=statute+of+limitations). 
NOBODY UPVOTE/DOWNVOTE THIS PERSON'S COMMENT!

It's at 420 brah
Sounds like you need to partake in the celebrations of April 20th.
He's been doing it for a while now. He did all the camera work on all the Transformer movies. Signed an exclusive contract. 
maybe OP has Parkinsons.
he is not that slow, he went back to grab something and that put him in the back of the group. 
The cop went after the chubby one lol. 
Like rad roaches?

Campus... cop? o_O
Lots of Universities have their own police force. Not some security BS, ones that can and will arrest you.
And they are worse than other cops because they spend all their time looking for underage drinkers.
It's bizarre in the U.S., because a majority of university and college students are underage, so they can't drink... it's such a different culture of having to sneak around drinking.
It seems like the same would be true for Highschool in places where the drinking age is 18. It's essentially the same dynamic: oldest age at the school is able to buy alcohol and then give it to all their underage friends.

Edit: Thinking back, the 21 age limit never really stopped anyone I knew from drinking anyways in Highschool.
But everywhere else, highschool is distinct in that you haven't the agency to drink, but when you go to tertiary education, you're granted independence, in more ways than one, but including in regards to alcohol.
this is the shakiest of shakie cams 
I literally have no original thoughts anymore.  Was just scrolling to see if anyone had commented on the camera work so I could make the MJ Fox joke.  
I finally lucked in to a thread where no one had made my obvious joke yet.  Plenty of shaking camera jokes sure, plenty of parkinsons jokes too, but no MJ Fox joke?  I've dreamed of this day.
Don't worry, you can make bank in karma by simply copying and pasting. 

Stick with "savage", "you can tell it's an X by the way it is", and saying "we did it reddit!" After a chain of comments that are only 1 letter each.

You'll have gold in like a day.
Don't forget to start your comment with "To be fair..." to ensure everyone knows how balanced and nuanced your opinion is.
Hm. Quite. 
FLC cops are actually police officers from the town, not rent-a-cops.
Would have appreciated a heads up to mute the video.
...that is beautiful, can we make this a thing?
it's a pot shop in Seattle actually, so it's kinda a thing
What did you guys do with the parachute when you were done? Did anyone pack it or was it just laying on campus each night? How many days did this trick work before you got busted? Awesome idea and cool pic proof!
parachute got taken that day. we had done it a couple times with a small group throughout the previous fall/spring.
it's 4/20 maaaaaan, just smoke some pots and relax.
Deep breaths.  It's okay, bro.  I'm right there with you.
Need to mute it before I can chill. 
This. I'm dying because of this. Thank you! 
Clown fiesta
Oh Durango...  We now have 10 recreational dispensaries, 6 breweries and a distillery.  In a town of 17K.  People always ask me if everyone is stoned in CO now because of recreational cannabis- I tell them no more stoned than they normally were, and this video proves it.  
And listening to Jim Cary yelling the most annoying sound in the world. 
I love it when Michael J Fox directs movies.
I really want to see what that guy is doing now.
This fucking guy.  xD
I think the 4/20 Stoner Parachute Dash has real potential as an album title or a dance number. 
He was trying to save the parachute!
I want to punch every retard thats laughing like a retard in the background.
I was only expecting maybe about 3 or 4 people to be under it. Goddam that was exhilarating watching them all flee in terror
Can someone make this less shaky? I want to see the tour group.
i like his intensity
Bravery upvote
This is ridiculous, the cop had the element of surprise. He should have shot at their legs to take as many down as possible and then used flexcuffs to secure them until a detainee transport bus could be brought in. How can seriously all of them escape. What are we paying these schmucks for?
If only the camera would shake a little more, that would be great. The video was a little too stable and viewable for my tastes.
SHIT, the guy went  crazy when the cop pulled the chute off
Policeman "Hey come on out of there, this is the police"

Parachute "Daves not here man"
How did you get so funny?
Fake it till ya make it.
Shake it til you make it 
By not being you.
Honestly, my friend mark just came up to me and said.  "Hey I have this parachute and we're all going to under it."  That was it.  I think it was kind of a rebel sort of thing.
What school was this? 
Fort Lewis College in Durango, CO
Someone needs to check the correlation between camera men and Parkinson's. There might be causation. 
The stabilized version reminded me more of 2C-C or 4-AcO-DMT.
So, much better right?

What the heck, was this filmed while someone was balancing on an inflatable ball?
Cop: Well screw you all then.. I'm taking this parachute home.. 
I am pretty sure this is who was filming/laughing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEo_thYmg3s

I know plenty of marijuana smokers and unfortunately they are very stupid and unmovitated, working dead end jobs. I was friends with some of them before but now all they want to do is smoke "that purp skurp" as they call it. sad
You just know shitty people, nothing to do with weed.
Siiiiiick sample size dude.

It is linked with lowered motivation, bunt that does't mean they're stupid.

The motivation is also only in heavy smokers, some people smoke marijuana only once in a while, and this kind of consumption won't have any negative effect, so who's to say the people in this clip are all at the same level as the people you know? 

that fucking laugh.
I expected it to be two stoners under a parachute
I feel like I just took a frag after watching that
Holy shit, that grow!
that's our small one :)
As a dankrupt smoker. Fuck you (but seriously nice grow). 
America's future is truly looking brighter than ever.
They got smoked in the last quarter.
During an earthquake.
Wait, I thought dank green nugs was the reference?
The city was started essentially as a gold miner's/prospector's settlement, thus the name Denver Nuggets. But now with almost a billion dollars a year in revenue, cannabis is by far a bigger industry than gold mining.
I...I...was making a joke....sorry
Kinda seemed as if you were unsure why they were called the Nuggets.
I thought it was pretty cut and dry http://i.imgur.com/TA3dY.jpg
Haha, sorry for the history lesson.
What's more, it was originally named after Christopher Columbus and his envisioning of the area upon first discovery as "The New World's El Dorado", hence the mashup name, Colorado.
That's, uh . . .COlumbus and, uh . . .DoRAdo, uh, Doritos.  Shit.  Don't we have some Doritos on top of the fridge?  Damn, my doob went out.  What time is it?  4:20?
Really? Gee..  I didn't know that.   
  
Silly me, always thought it was for the Spanish word 'colorado', in reference to the red rocks that gave the Colorado river its name. 
Yeah, i'm pretty sure it means colored red.
It does.  The state was named after the Rio Colorado, which got its name from the red rocks. It literally means "River the color of red". I was just being a sarcastic jerk 
But which one will be taught in history?
Battle of the fittest is rough man
dude laughs like a hyena    
AAAAAHHHHHAAAHHHAAAAAHAAA

More like chasing the kid who ran back to grab evidence.
Classic Fort Lewis, the stonedest school on the planet.
This was at my school! Haha ah... Colorado has its perks.
This was 9 years ago :o
That's exactly how zebras avoid being captured by lions.
Lol I refer to it as a reach myself, I've recently been hearing other Canadians using it 
The parachute didn't soften the comedown at all.
Under-rated movie in my opinion. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111293/?ref_=nv_sr_1
This might beat rhubarb lady as my favorite video on the internet
Pretty sure that wasn't the idea at all.
And this year's oscar for best cinematography goes to...
I remember seeing this on Digg. 
I haven't seen this video in almost a decade. Thank you
ACH^ooo
Ah the bear theory. All you have to do is outrun the guy behind you. 
I went to school here...Skyhawks represent! :). The best part is the prospective parent/tour group watching all the action...
Thanks you for this, original made me feel like I was watching a Michael J Fox home movie.
Im a stoner and I am often stoned.  What are you saying?

Here, hit this.
what a laugh! 
The video is older than reddit.
Thank you! Now to just turn off the sound and the video will be much much better. 
This happened at my college years ago. No one initially got caught. The dumbasses left their digital camera under the parachute when they ran and the police used that to catch a good number of them.
Can't have it infecting anyone.
That's why you should always ice your igloo. Every year while growing up my brother and I would build an igloo on the edge of our front lawn, Then spray the inside and out side with water to build up a tick layer of ice to help support the structure. One morning we woke up and went out to play and found chunks of headlight and front bumper on/in the front of the igloo. The igloo itself hardly took any damage. 
Any time it's not rape, you've won.
Well even if it is rape your body has ways of blocking the conception and winning against pregnancy.
Oh man we used to build quinzees at every boy scout meeting in the winter back in the day. Those were fun times, fartin' around in the woods making quinzees and whittling spears.
AMA request, slowest stoner under the parachute. 
i posted an AMA a while ago, apparently it's just goin down in r/videos lol
Would be cool if they did an alternate green nugget uniform.
Had a friend that legitimately laughed like that in high school. Good lord.
This is phenomenal 
[The Jail Blazers](http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/08/sports/sp-nbarep8) (from 2003)


&gt;Damon Stoudamire was arrested on marijuana charges after allegedly trying to pass through an airport metal detector with almost 1 1/2 ounces of the drug **wrapped in aluminum foil**.

Some things are weird man 
This was post 9/11 so he couldn't even play the "man, airports used to be so lax on security" card
Wow what 
....I bought a dub from my friend's dealer who have it to me in aluminum foil
Does the video taker have Parkinsons?? Jeebus, I almost had a seizure watching that. 
turns out he was actually the fastest, just being a decoy to give the fatties a chance
2007? How old is the 4/20 thingy?
My roommate had one of these in college. We would take it to the big field across from our backyard. It was everything you would expect. We were able to get at least 20 people in it each with their own pipe, piece, or smokable.
You know that they're all sitting on that parachute, tucking it under their butts (like we did as kids), and then were like, "One, two, three, Breeeeaaak!"
Thanks, now my curiosity is satisfied. I counted 29
That guys laugh gets me
stablized... ok now I have sea sickness
Apparently eBaumsworld content from the early 2000s is making a comeback.

I'm more afraid for the cameraperson, who appears to have been caught in a severe earthquake.
The commentary and shaking made this video even funnier to me.  Dudes excitement was contagious!
Sometimes the commentary [makes it better.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KvxOuC7Bhc)
Dude was probably just as stoned himself, I'd probably lose my shit if I saw that happen too. Not if I was filming it though I guess
It's gotta be in r/contagiouslaughter
That guy laughing like a wild hyena is the friend who's still laughing at a joke way too hard after everyone else is done and now are just looking at each other awkwardly wondering why they hang with this guy.
And in other news Bernie Sanders, Barak Obama and Donald Trump appear to be smoking a joint on the White House lawn. Never thought I would see the day! 
Was the person recording this having a seizure?

This is like the scene in 2 fast 2 furious when all the cars scramble at the end from the garages.

Oh my god. History has been made here. Do you ever get shown this video? How does it feel to be secretly internet famous?
i have been shown it before, yes. i definitely don't keep it a secret that i was involved to those people. it's pretty crazy though. once i realized that video had over a million views on YT i was pretty pleased with our little group :)
Neat! Thanks for answering!

You're doing the flying spaghetti montster's work.
I love image-stabilization
Was this filmed by Michael J. Fox?
i want this cameraman to film my wedding
This article made me feel better about going to grad school at the U a couple years ago. 
I always heard it was Deaver.
It was Sweetwood.  He admitted so much to me a couple weeks later.  Poor guy...but hilarious video.  FLCPD at their intuitive finest. 
we could kill him

They needed a parachute, because they got so high.
Is it just me or with that many people under a parachute, would they be getting a high off of both the weed and a lack of oxygen?
He was probably thinking to himself, "Maximum effort!!"
I guess reddit is a recycling facility today
yes; doesn't make it any less funny, Hunny-Bunny.
NEVER SEEN THIS ONE BEFORE 
Hey I was there.  Freshman year at Fort Lewis.  If you notice, they scheduled visits for that day.  There are tours in the background.  people either said I am fucking going to this school no matter what, or ran screaming.
For the shortest amount of time at 19 seconds, he laughs like Patrick Star when Spongebob blows the giant elephant bubble.
Did Vash the Stampede film this video?
Ayyyy you know Jeff Baker
quite well.

This is in Durango Colorado,  I was on campus that day.  It's a total legend at the school. 
He seriously sounds like an over excited chimpanzee.

This thread is awesome
Repost from 2007, I think it's fair to say while OP may be inflicted with faggotry, he probably does not have parkinson's.
If you can predict large earthquakes that far in advance i'm going to have to disagree and say that's a waste of talent. 
The guy laughing in the video made it just that much funnier hahah
That's at Fort Lewis in CO. My brother saw this happen while he was taking a tour of the campus in ( I think) 2005.
wasn't THAT funny.
This video has been on the Internet for quite a while. The guy that went back was grabbing his weed. I guess he dropped it, and tbh it was pretty ballsy to go back for it. I remember reading about that when this video was first posted. 
Dat laugh doe
OMFG!!! This is some great shit :P I mean those stoners were like..our ASS on fire!!
Holy shit I haven't seen this video in like 15 years.
&gt;The igloo, tucked away in a wooded area, was 5-feet high 

Now that's some dank weed
You da real mvp
He fucks
I've never seen this with audio and that dude's laugh makes it even better lmao
Even before it begins, you can just hear how fucking excited he his!
I know right! What a goofball haha
This was perfectly okay because at the time there were no more important priorities for law enforcement in the area.
Ballgag.
The dubs ended up winning.... Somehow 
Jesus, did you have Michael J Fox film this?
Stoned guy narrating needs to calm that hyena laugh down.

How the hell can this be fake? And is this 2009 who comments if a video is fake 
Holy shit, would have been enjoyable if camera guy didn't go berserk
Now if only we could get a muted version, where you can't hear that annoying guy losing his shit in the background. 
Why do they have to be stoners?

now thats funny
gracias

wish I could take credit for it but it's actually from a standup set by a comedian whose name which escapes me at the moment. 
theres probably a reason for that
woah man, like, what are you trying to say dude?
Dude's laugh reminds me of [Patrick Star's during Spongebob's driving test.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8ch19BOi8E&amp;t=5s)
I remember the first time I saw this video... 12 years ago.
Can you imagine seeing that in person? I would be howling just like him

Michael J. Fox is a horrible cameraman 
My sister went to Fort Leisure when this happened. Durango is such a beautiful place. 
I thought the layout looked familiar... transferring there in the fall!
It's a great school but it's small as fuck so make sure you get involved with some kind of club or rec sport. It took me a while to meet people
It's amazing. 
Hey, you're the lemon guy!

we're all *the* lemon guy or we're all lemon guys?

Holy shit contagious laughter. That's fucking hilarious.
Glad Michael J. Fox has the time to film shit like this.
Awesome but could you also remove the audio?
Legendary
I knew a lot of people in that parachute. I actually went to a friends house last minute instead of doing this. My dorm room was a 30 second walk to that exact spot. There was a camera left in the chaos and some people were identified and got ticketed. One of those girls who got a ticket went on to run one of the largest dispensaries in the state. [One of our local newspaper just did an article on this video.](http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20160420/NEWS01/160429993/0/NEWS01/Remembering-the-%E2%80%984/20-Parachute-Stoner-Dash%E2%80%99)  


EDIT: Spelling
Did the videographer strap the camera to a shake weight?
Less hyena laugh, more yackety sax.
Jesus, you would think that the person holding the camera was running with them.
Caught? He didn't catch a single person.
His internal caps-lock is broken to this day
2007...
It's unfortunate  that someone could be such such a total nob that they call the police on stoners in a big parachute. 
'Lol the campus cop half-heartedly chasing the slowest stoner'
This video is so old and so good. I still laugh every time I see it
Too funny! Just a shame that Michael J Fox was holding the camera 
Fort Lewis FTW
Seen it.... or did I? Umm... Got any tacos?
Jeez, does the guy filming this suffer from Parkinson's Disease?
Gotta get at least one for his numbers
His laugh is my favourite part 
I was in Cooper hall when this happened, this was filmed across the hall from my dorm.

Thanks Captain surprise-ruiner
Shit, deleted it. I wasnt even thinking. If I knew how to do spoiler text I'd be cool.
It's cool. Happy cake day bruh
nuggets would be great right now
That one was almost worse. 
Fuck you
Why was he moving so much trying to film it? Was he furiously masturbating?
Thanks for taking part in one of the greatest videos in internet history.
thanks for watching!
Wow, that photo!

Any job openings?
How did the idea come about? Did someone already have a parachute and suggest it or did you go out and buy one?
it was my friends parachute. we came up with the idea by trying to organize something on 4/20 like the students up in boulder always do. since they college was only like 4,000 kids our was a little less impressive...
TIL I'm not the only one depraved enough to think if a Parkinson's joke.
Why didn't he just shoot all of them?
Every year...

"AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HAHAHAAAAAAAAA!"
Someone needs to help the person holding the camera. They are clearly having a seizure. 
Oldie but goodie. Funny how the cop acts like a lion trying to pick off the slowest/weakest of them. 
Super predators. Oh wait, no thats just black people. 
I should try uploading old videos too
"It was quite the super bowl, Rick. Back to you at the studio."

"It's just us in our living room Justin."
I think this was one of the first videos I've ever seen on reddit. It gets posted annually on 4/20, at the very least.
The screaming just ruined it.  Fuck this video 
I've always liked this version better 
https://youtu.be/rqzliObVDvc
When it said 'Stoners' I was thinking two people. Boy was I wrong.
Was Michael J Fox holding the camera?
That might be the most infectious laugh I ever heard.
I'm way more concerned about the camera person's Palsy. 
These the same guys who made cloverfield and blair witch?
Filmed by Michael J Fox.
Next time don't let the kid with Parkinson's hold the camera.
/r/unexpected lmfao I swear I thought maybe 2 were going to come out! That was great! 
How is an undulating clown tent in the middle of a lawn supposed to be inconspicuous?

Exactly, the process of being hooved.
Nobody said "inconspicuous". Maybe you misread the title.
No one said it is. No one is trying to be conspicuous here.
That is my college of choice
dat laff, doe!
oh my god his laugh is so contagious!
I pushed a little extra air out my nose.
The one kid had to grab his parachute or else he would have gotten away. Pretty risky to do this in the middle of the yard like that. 
I was under there, my 15 seconds of fame. Red section (pleat?) to the left. 
Look closely. That was actually the fastest and smartest stoner. He managed to get out, double back, lift up the parachute, retrieve something(wallet or phone?) and still make a break for it and evade the cop while - and this part is debatable - not wearing shoes.
Gets reposted every year like clockwork. 
[User from inside the tent!](http://reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4fmy7a/stoners_get_caught_smoking_under_a_parachute/d2aiqdk)
Yup you looked like a stoner. Fucking hilarious though, bravo.
This should be a Grand Event every year. Kind of like running with the bulls, but with pigs! 
Funny but please stabilize? 
Did y'all go into it expecting to get caught and just said 'fuck it', or did everyone expect to get away with it? Kudos for escaping, by the way
we did expect to get caught. we positioned the parachute over a drain pipe and the original plan was to just bring blunts and joints and ditch them down the drain pipe. it was also only going to be like five people. so that plan went to shit. and thank you :)
lol that's actually a pretty crafty plan.  What happened with your roommate and the cop who came for him?
they had a photo of him smoking something rolled and he stood his ground that it was a rolled cigarette and they had no evidence to charge him.
haha nice.  they seriously expected him to just passively admit it was a joint?  nice try i guess 
perennial post - never fails
This is like reverse stabilization... The frame keeps moving, but the person stays still.
Parkinson's hand. Holy shit this camera man sucks 
I did this at Coachella once!
Lol the last guy wanted his parachute back.
Thanks Justin, lets send it back to OP for the weather.
We call it grass now.

Jesus! Settle down, Beavis.
It's boulder, CO. It's pretty much always like that.
Ma Fuggin Fort Lewis! Loved this place when I went there.  That was my dorm in the background. 
This video is as old as the Internet. 
They clearly had an escape plan and 10/10 execution.

too bad some guy is now dead in the desert because stoners stole his parachute.
there was also a chimp there looks like
I don't think reporting your stolen weed is a good idea.
2007 called, they said to get your money out of the stock exchange before 08.

It's way older than that though.  I remember seeing this video on Ebaums world.

No im pretty sure its 2007. A couple of buddies of mine split off from the tour group to go join the parachute, and they graduated hs that year
According to this [paper](http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20160420/NEWS01/160429993/0/FRONTPAGE/Remembering-the-%E2%80%984/20-Parachute-Stoner-Dash%E2%80%99) it happened in 2007.
Ebaum's world was around in 2007. It's actually still around. 
No. It was in 2007.
I can remember seeing this video for the 1st time when a friend of mine told me about this awesome new website called YouTube.

Michael J fox's brief stint in directing. 
[But it do] (http://i.imgur.com/PgOwLRp.jpg).
Its been really rolled out for a joint plan
Can confirm it was 2007... source: kid that goes back at the end is my childhood best friend
JUST BLAZE!!!
Thank you for this.  Now all we need is this no audio gif version and we're in business. 
Who the hell is recording this? Michael J Fox?
No - Mr. Fox wouldn't have shaken the camera nearly as much.
This has to be some of the worst camera work I've ever seen. 
The original's horrendous camera work gave me a great idea:

If you're filming out a window, and the angle allows, press your camera/phone (works better with a phone) against the glass. You can put a finger between the glass and the phone to adjust angle.

I just tried it, and it works *beautifully*!
Maybe he called the cops cause he lost his wallet. 
Thank you for stabilizing. If this is your Youtube account, you should add a link to the original video.
Will do, although I think this post may be a re-post
Very possible, but I did a quick search and the video OP posted is by far the oldest one I could find.
Holy Shaking Camera Batman!
That dude's got a very punchable laugh.
I wish the camera was more shakey.
/r/contagiouslaughter
The guy laughing made me laugh harder. Good stuff.
I would have called this event "The 420 Yard Dash"
Anyone who questions evolution just listen to that guys laugh. All laugh's sound very monkey like but that guys is spot on. 
Everybody run, earthquake!
Did someone manage to save the parachute? Every time I see this I get sad that such an awesome thing could get confiscated.
confiscated :(
You're a monster
And I want everything to do with you 
needs more shaking 
Or his parachute. 
Must be tough setting up that parachute during an earthquake
Or his parachute.
Report it stolen
Yeah, I bet that would work.  You don't think the police would be just a little suspicious?
Or just say you left it under a parachute while smoking weed because they literally can't do jack shit about it after the fact.  It's not even illegal to smoke it's just illegal to possess. 
same video with beats and looped laugh(S)

The one thing you can count on -- this video making it to the frontpage every 4/20.
Oh how I love this video - one of my all time favorites. I think the funniest part is the guy recording the video.
I like that one dude who is too stoned to care to run. He just slowly walks away. Meanwhile, the cop ignores him and continues to chase the guy running, even though the guy walking is right next to him.
The references haha
Ya know, I've heard that smoking marijuanas can cause short term memory loss and even short term memory loss.

Neato!
That idiot actually replied with a photo in this thread - left a phone behind and went back for it.
I don't think the cop was really trying that hard. Note how they just kind of stand there for about 10 seconds or so after they pull off the Parachute. I think when the person came running back, the cop was posturing more than actually trying to chase after them.

If they wanted to nab someone, they would have. It was probably more of a "DISBURSE NOW" thing. It's not like the people were hurting anything.
Holy hell give a drink to the person filming to counter those shakes
I think he had too many already.
Who gave Michael J. Fox the camera?

i was a drum circle hippie, but the parachute owner is my buddy. we planned this little even together, along with my college roommate.
How much does weed cost compared from 2007 to now?
depends on who you knew/know. but it's gotten cheaper here in CO

Nah like... after maybe?
I know some of the people in that parachute.
In high school my friends and I built a portable hotbox. It disassembled when not in use and for travel. We would find a new location on the weekends and hotbox away. Some people called the cops, others joined. It was all good fun. 
Imagine your job is to sneak up on teenagers that are smoking pot and try to catch them so you can throw them in a cage. How do you cope with that level of indignity??
I went to school there 4 years ago and this was a few years old by then.  FLC 420 STONER DASH!

The video looked like it was filmed by a guy with Parkinsons 
Should have normalized the audio as well
This should be top comment 
Has anybody ever listened to you when you made that comment?
You obviously did 
No, I really didn't.
that "one idiot" is in this thread and he explained why. He left his phone which was incriminating evidence.
Holy crap just saw that, too perfect. not a crime if you don't get caught. 
Your video is shaky,  would you like us to fix this for you?  Y/N?

Stoner has violent seizure while filming stoners getting caught under parachute.

To me it looked like he was gonna try to run but realized it was hard then maybe thought he would go  back under and hide but that was hard too
I saw this on Collegehumor a couple years back. 
Glad I found it again.
Thge laugh on this video gets me every time - so mischievous 
me too thanks.
I just upvoted this to 420
I was only expecting like three people in a small circle. Not a herd of like 50. 
I can't breathe. 
It's nice because all these guys different laughs are your typical stoner laughs. Especially the huhuhuhuhuhuh one in the background is almost an exact copy of one of my friends stoner laughs.

It's been too long that I laughed as hysterical as that guy though.
If you believe reddit, that guy got away.  Source, the dude posts ^
I've never heard Snort Lewis but I love it. Fits the school so well. 
Seems all but one got away.
There sure is a lot of nature out there...
lol I just gave a presentation stoned and killed it
That's like me, but in reverse! Quality of life is so much better now.

No that's me

Many thanks good sir.
Yeah it can even cause short term memory loss
Guy posted above saying it was him. He went back to get his phone that had incriminating evidence on it. Didn't get caught.
He actually commented higher up with photo proof. He said he was holding his bowl and phone in the same hand when everyone scattered and dropped his phone so he went to get it back because its incriminating evidence. And apparently also outran the cop barefoot
Wait, who's stoned in this video? The people under the parachute or the guys filming? 
Fucking Christ, couldn't even finish watching the video once that hyena laugh started up.
I thought he was going to fold up the parachute to put it away 
It's never easy filming anything during an earthquake. 
I'm mostly annoyed that the video was so bad

This was not nearly as hysterical as this dude was finding it.

It also causes memory loss
And this is why I immediately went to the comments.  Thanks!
They don't think it be like it is, but it do.
It might be hard to tell since the camera was shaking more than Michael J. Fox, but that dude clearly got away
That's todays date
THANK YOU!
hahahahaha most excellent
Shaky camera guy may need a toke or two to steady his/ her hand.  
I was disappointed that a huge cloud of smoke didn't come out of the parachute when they lifted it up.
Thank you reddit! I laughed so hard I teared up and everything.

One of my old friends injected 4 marijuana. Thats right, I said 4. I cant believe he would do something like that. Anyways, he injected them and immediately after turned gay
The camera isn't shaky enough for me
Damn OP sorry about your Parkinson's.

i've never been high on drugs but im guessing its much like this?
Any folks who doesn't believe we condescended from monkeys just need to watch this video.

Ahh, the stoner out in its natural habitat.

what you see here, is stoners adopting the survival technique of shoaling. Where the cop is the hungry shark and the stoners are the bait ball. Most will get away and be free to smoke again. Well except that one, that became the meal for the shark at 0:38.(i'm guessing owner of said chute). such is life.

FORRRTT LEWWISSS! Graduated in 2013, coopers hall.  Used to live up on coalbank ave in skyridge, we threw some pretty fun parties. Cheers Skyhawks. And yes I did Graduate.
They scurried the fuck out of there like cockroaches. 
Called a tip here too. Makes for the good ole "you have a tip dude?" "Yeah, stop smoking". 
I'm crying I'm laughing so hard at this. 
Probably the weed
Jesus, shakiest camera ever-- cameraman needs to 'chill out' himself.
I think he had "chilled" - that might have been the problem.
Fort lewis College, Durango Colorado. My brother didn't participate but saw this from his dorm.
SWIM was there ;)
But I mean, I played when I was a kid and turned out just fine with no brain injuries.
Should we tell him? 
Should we tell you?
Should i tell myself?
Ever consider decaf?
It's like killing a female spider
Jim?
Fort Lewis!
Was Michael J Fox taking that video?
Was the person filming this having a seizure?
This is adorable
Does youtube have a feature to remove grating laughter too?  So many times I could use that.
LOL! They do have a "mute" button, I suppose. ;)
Was there an earthquake happening while this was being filmed?
That hurt my eyes to watch
The adult version of playing with the giant parachute in gym class. 
Cuz you're at [10], maybe? 
This comment confused me.
stoned stoners watching stoney stoners watch stoners get stoned getting stoned?
And I will not be harassed



...bitch!
That's the only one that's not acceptable
I was here! This is Fort Lewis (Fort Leisure) College in Durango CO in 2008 I believe? Everyone got busted because 3 people had cameras and were taking pictures and dropped them when the cop came in. Haha classic!

Edit: A word. 
I guess over time roach went from meaning the little bit of card that you use as a filter and don't smoke, to just any bit that you don't smoke.
Oh making a roach-weed bowl when you're out of fresh bud was the best.  Wet, sticky, tarry weed that burns twice as long.  I had a few friends who would use cigarette boxes as roach boxes as a last-line weed source.  This was before weed was so damn accessible where I live though.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
What the fuck did they think would happen?
Not "coupure"?
Nope, the slang is "cut". If we want to say it in french, we say "filtre". 
TIL smoking weed automatically makes you a stoner 
haha ha... what
That's amazing haha. Happy 420 everybody!
My friend was under this parachute. If you look closely you can see him run back for his cell phone in the bottom right of the frame.

Proof: http://imgur.com/Mq0tkPg
A couple of my buddies were part of the tour group and split off to join the parachute. Who does a campus tour on 4/20?

It's like that gif where someone kills the slider and 4 million baby spiders burst out and go everywhere. 

Fucking that gif
Haha. oh god! I poked the parachute and now stoners are everywhere!
Holy shit, does the cameraman have Parkinson's? He should smoke weed - I hear that helps the symptoms.
Damn I would hate to be the one MF to get caught
thank you i could of sworn i was getting car sickness from watching that
It's could HAVE.. Could "Of" is never correct! 
man i see so many guys writing of that at one point i thought it was the right one, fuck stupid goats
Just follow the trails of Doritos back to their dorm rooms
ITT:  The camera is so shaky XDDD
I will not be harassed... *BITCH!*
Those stoners were most assuredly NOT caught smoking under the parachute. They weren't caught at all. 
Musta heard that a while back.
Also cause it's a division between the weed and your mouth (a cut)

Also known as Bus tickets lmao.
MTL bus tickets arnt bad, but the very best in cut material is without a doubt those little receipts you get from the STM ticket&amp;pass machines. I hoard them! 
Oh yeah, for sure, but remember the [old transfers](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2735/1728/1600/new%20transfer.jpg)? Already the perfect size, just need to cut the length a bit, and the cardboard was perfect.
Old bus transfers were without a doubt the best. A close second were the "wings" of the inner part of the old 25 pack of cigarettes.

Roach is not acceptable.  A roach is the very last bit of a blunt or joint.  Go watch some cheech and Chong you damn kids.
I need an aspirin after watching this shaky mess
Horrible recording job, here's a down vote
Think I just got high by watching the video.
I hope everyone survived the 7 magnitude and made it out of the low security prison.

Yo dawg
This was supposed to be invisible!
Thank god for this...thought the camera holder was having a stroke.  Also would have helped to have the volume up and hear the background noise. 
What was it?
**Can we learn to hold a camera?﻿**
That's my Alma Mater.   Thanks FLC!!
Uhh...  What?
Remember Rule #68 of America, if an idea exists, it has probably been used as an attempt to evade taxes. 
We also call it a roach but I've heard people call it a spliff too
A spliff is a joint with half weed and half tobacco. 
Then Canadians have that word all wrong
I'm Canadian. Maybe it's just you?
I don't think so, roach never means the filter itself from my experience, "roach" is just the end of the joint when you either reach the filter or the joint is just resin-coated paper. "Crutch" or simply "filter" refers to the actual folded piece of paper that's used as the filter/as something so it's easier to hold the end and not get scooby snacks.
We need another one.
I was going to go to class I swear but if you hadn't heard everything is flooded so I'm staying high and dry.
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high
I love how the last guy is so stoned that casually starts folding the tent up until he realized the cop was right there.
Fantastic camera work
And who goes under a parachute to get high
Did Michael j fox film this? 
Remember smoker, when chase by wild politsiya, you not have to run fastest. Just faster than other smokers.

You know what my man, I misread I appologize wholeheartedly and will upvote
Apparently an magnitude 9.0 earthquake was occurring at the time this video was filmed
Yea, that's just a multi-colored yurt. 
Also still not legal to do it in public.
Yeah, this shit gets reposted every 6 months
nope. its a crutch. 

a roach is the leftover after being smoked and it doesn't filter anything... so its not one of those. 
How about different people call different things different names? In the UK, a roach is the cardboard you put your lips around to smoke. 
TYL people have different names for different things. 
TYL you were wrong. 
No, plenty of people use the term that way, certainly in the UK at least. You can even buy pre-cut 'roach paper' here to make the roaches with
but it isn't a roach until after its the end of a joint. 

until then its just cardboard. 

just like toast isn't toast until after its been toasted. its just bread. 
Where I'm from, you roll a joint with a roach. The roach is a bit of cardboard you use as a mouthpiece, as it were. Rather than just sticking paper in your mouth, the paper is strengthened by cardboard. Called a roach.
Alright, I'm wrong. Everyone uses the same words. For everything. 

So if everyone uses the same word for everything, how did different languages develop? Why don't Japanese stoners call it a roach? Or Russian stoners? 
Now that, that is some beautiful camerawork. 
Great camera work on this one.
you can lose both at the same time
and even short term memory loss I would add. 
nice one... nice one...
Does the poster have a speech thing? Wtf is up with that shrill laugh 
Ya know, I've heard that smoking marijuanas can cause short term memory loss and even short term memory loss. 

The oldest video on the internet. Still around and still hilarious.
I was gonna go to class...
Hey did you know smoking causes short term memory loss?
This video is older than the internet itself.  I still see it at least once every 3 months.  Damn.
I read that in Homer Simpson's voice
I called in sick this morning because I'm sick only to realize what date it is after.

"And was totally cool with that."
Are they trying to hide or trying to clam bake or both?  
The cameraman is the highest one in the video. 
At my college I imagine myself running away alone and getting tased while everyone else sits and accepts their fate like the sheep they are
Fucking legends
And yet my local smoke shop guy gives me the blank stare into infinity whenever i mention either of these names. He refers to them as "tip". Which, I think, is actually the best term for it
Nah roach is specifically post smoked where I'm from
in Poland it's called a whistle.
That is odd, but fun.
We call it a roach too when referring to the stubbed remnants. For the actual "filter", we call them tips. What's your area?

This is from 2007, these guys all have desk jobs or living in their mom's basement.
Well you dont need to "puff, puff, pass"

"long term loss of short term memory" is what my dad says to me when I forget things :(
Video was uploaded in '07, so this was recorded prior to that. Weed has only been legal there since 2012/2013
lol that sound
I thought weed was legal in Colorado? Why chase anyone
Ladies and gentlemen, the time trials for the 420 yard dash.
Can somebody please stabilize this video? I'm getting motion sickness.
I guess someone is going to get 5 years in the can for this serious felony. 
There's an option when you upload a video to facebook to stabilize the video.  I feel like them not selecting that is a giant fuck you to my eyeballs
I'm definitely gonna need to smoke a bowl for the nausea caused by the shaky camera. 
Goddamn this is like 10 years old.
Pretty hilarious, but the dude laughing is just horrible. I feel bad for his roommates.

Is this in Fort Lewis, Colorado?!
I just read somewhere that marijuana can call short-term memory loss. 
'stoners'?

ok grampa, you must be as old as this vid....
A classic
It's almost like smoking pot doesn't automatically ruin your life. Much like having a drink.
That laugh!!! Hahahaha
Stoners stoners Stoners stoners stoners stoners Stoners stoners
No way ppl in parachute were as high as the people filming.
wow... I cant believe no one had seen this posted on reddit like 20 times like i have now. WELCOME NEW REDDITORS! there are so many of you...
Then why did they get caught if it's Colorado
This was like 10 years ago. Pot illegal as fuck still. 
I think this video is like 5 years old. At least I think I remember seeing it when I was in high school. Could be wrong though.   
Edit: just looked at the YouTube link. It was in 2007. 
That makes sense. 
If I was in that tour group I'd fucking cancel all my other college trips and tours cause I just made my choice.
Distinctive laugh thought that was funny...
Based on most videos involving cops on reddit ... I thought for sure someone was about to be shot.
This guy has the most punchable laugh.
You know it WORKED. Nobody can deny that.

With so many people anyone identified in the rush could all just deny usage and point blame in circles until the law gives up.

That cop only (presumably) caught that one guy because he was both slow and tried to go back - presumably to grab something that'd incriminate him.

THE PLAN WORKED PERFECTLY.
Seconded.
Whenever people talk about stoners I think about all the exams I have aced in college completely stoned AF. I think my lowest test score I have ever gotten was taken completely sober.

Edit: Not that I take every exam after smoking. xD
Need a stabilized version of this asap. Seasick.
Which term memory what?
Thats an interesting fact but did you also know that Marijuanas can cause short term memory loss?
Their just trying to make their own hot air balloon. 
TIL, tomorrow I forget.
Pretty good quality for a 2007 or earlier phone camera (or it's just a normal camera, fuck if I know) 
Hahaha.... Why were they in such a visible spot?? At least 3 apartment buildings could plainly see them as well as tour groups!
Fort Lewis college in Durango CO.
ITT: People smoking weed = stoners
They came out like baby spiders
True. And a happy wake and bake to you too!
yeah you really don't need the gimmick.  It's not like it's that hard to find cardboard. 
I have never wanted to punch someone so much as I do the guy laughing in the video.... common dude ... reign it in.
Can someone stabilize this video Jesus it was making me car sick just watching it 
[This guy](http://reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4fmy7a/stoners_get_caught_smoking_under_a_parachute/d2aiqdk) seems to be doin' alright!

When I had my first apartment at 19, the only weed I was able to get was super shitty, $5 an 8th ditch weed. It was so bad that I would have to smoke 2-3 brongs under a blanket fort to get high. 
How many brongs now?! 
2-3 brongs, bo.
We are witnessing the moment when a new idiom is born. We can all tell our grandchildren we were there when it happened. Whoa. But I may have just been spending too much time under the 'chute brah.
This is *stoned* history. 
Here in the Netherlands parachutes are for jumping. This purpose it is used for here is new to me. 
Your stoners must lack imagination.

You guys have gravity bongs and apple pipes there right?
Nah mate, just joints. 
Not even glassware?

Damn dude, no wonder you guys mix in tobacco, joints are harsh as shit compared to a bong.

Stoners film Stoners getting caught smoking under a parachute*
Inception?
I used to but I don't want my now-colleagues to know that I'm a huge pothead and never having a cover for your Rizlas is like the biggest sign. I'm a connoisseur now, I only use allocated roach-cardboard. I've practically made the move from white lightning to lambrini - moving up in the world, baby!
If you smoke roll ups I assume you smoke weed or at least have in the past. I wouldn't have started rolling cigarettes if I hadn't first had to develop my rolling skills for a joint.
It's one of those regional things. Roll-up cigarettes in Europe are way more popular than North America. If I see someone with rollies on the streets of London, whatever, he's one of the millions smoking rollies because they're cheaper. Here, I'm like you motherfucker are you holding out on me.   
    
So in a lot of places, that missing cover is what'll out you as a REEFER HEAD
You'd be surprised, one of the many millions smoking rollies and presumably one of the many millions smoking weed.
Haha, I don't think that's the case in the UK. I actually found it really weird because when I first when to the States I had multiple bouncers/security guards in bars come up to me shining a torch at me because I was rolling cigarettes and they always assumed it was pot... Never had that happen in the UK/Europe as I think roll-ups are way more common.
I smoked weed before I started rolling cigs but I didn't roll a joint until awhile after I started rolling cigs. I was always more of a pipe fan when it came to weed.
Yup yup. If it was cutters choice, it was a given too. 
&gt;that I'm a huge pothead and never having a cover for your Rizlas is like the biggest sign.

the fact that you have Rizlas is probably already giving it away...
More to the point your rizla pack falls apart and you have no rizla!!
Ahhh Lambrini, the Lamborghini of cheap perry
That drink allowed me to make it through University - £2.50 for like 3 units of alcohol?! Hell yeah.
Nah bro, Tesco/Coop £4 bottle of wine 9.4 units currently getting me through university.
There's just something about lambrini that gets me especially fucked up. No other drink has caused me to piss all over my desk/laptop/2 years of notes. What a night.
You fancy motherufucker... everyone in my area was buying swisher sweets and white owls tonight lawl.

This guy's laugh reminds me of Vash from the English dub Trigun.
And the moral is that you don't have to be the best to contribute to the group. Sometimes taking one for the team is more important than how fast you can run.
It wasn't as funny as that guy thought
I really hope he got away. We never saw the resolution. It would suck if he was caught and booked in lieu of the other dozens of people there. "I'm not going down for everyone else's crimes!"
Or an inspirational poster:

Every late morning the stoner wakes up. He knows he must be faster than the fastest campus security officer or it will be sent to student conduct court. 

Every morning the campus security guard wakes up. He knows he must be faster than the slowest stoner, or nothing really bad will happen anyways.

It doesn't matter if you're a stoner or campus security guard. College is pretty sweet.
It was.  Nowadays if I try to smoke under a parachute,  it's straight to jail every time. 

Jk it's colorado, they'd probably slap me on the wrist for smoking in public, maybe take my shit.  I never carry a lot anyway though
I'd like to imagine that this is what I stoner with a go pro would be like.
Both phones and youtube offers stabilization, and yet NONE.
1 fucking year i have to wait!?
it'll give you time to percolate a baby


and the author time to procrastinate for 11.9 months
percolate? alright mary
Percocet.  Fillibuster.
Check your math,  there,  buddy.  11.9 months would be  362 days from now,  and the book doesn't drop for another 3 days after that.
I NEED AT LEAST THREE DAYS TO WRITE IT DON'T I
Pshh, maybe if YOU'RE the slowest stoner.
Well it's not called The Fastest Stoner
That's today!
Sounds like they are being watched by a group of hyenas. 
Fakkin hippy drum circles
Lmao omg that's great I was not expecting THAT many ppl. 😂😂😂😂. I think the cop was thinking the same. 
I wonder why you retard
ok! 
/r/contagiouslaughter 
Which gives you 4-5 roaches, maybe another 5 once you've stripped the entire packaging. Then you're left with shitloads of loose papers
Yeah but I smoke through a whole thing of papers before I need more than a couple of roaches.
I can not stop watching this lol

The guys laugh is hysterical also lol

 
&gt;Jordan Smith, a freshman at the time, said the group had planned to roll joints and center the circle around a drain. That way, if cops arrived they could destroy the evidence and run.

That's actually a pretty darn good idea.
Thats the one Im thinking of. I dont partake anymore but my mates do and thats what they use. With the little elastic band.
Yep, they're the ones. Great papers - nice and thin and they're made out of unbleached hemp paper so when I'm smoking with all my hippy buddies I can act all cool like them.
I just got them because the guy at the shop suggested them (Amsterdam ofc) and afterwards was just like "... holy shit these papers are amazing!!"
Yeah Amsterdam is where I first had them. Thankfully they're pretty common in shops in the UK now.
I just order roach booklets online. Got a 10 pack for like £2 on amazon. I smoke pretty rarely nowadays so I don't need king size rizlas haha
Best part of this video is this guy's laugh
I expected to see a massive cloud of smoke come out and get the cop second-hand-stoned lol 
That laugh... It sounds like a banshee being tickled to death.

Lay off the damn reefer, boy.
I disagree. Lay on the damn reefer, boy.
i'm glad the pigs don't have anything better to do than harass pot users.

fire the pigs and make them get productive jobs. you know, jobs that actually contribute to society in some way
Yeah those dirty pigs.  How dare they tell people not to do something that's against the law.
considering the amount of tax money we waste on the military-industrial/security complex, yeah it would probably be a good decision. 

rand paul understands me, he knows how much money we waste as crony capitalism and the war-mongering faction within the us. well he is also pro-legalization.

someone who stands for freedom rather than social conservatism and imperialism in the name of a false notion of "freedom." oh and who also opposes the police state tactics of our government with prism etc.

what a concept
Sorry, you used the term "military-industrial complex", everything after that became invalid.
right, i used the same term dwight eisenhower used to describe an internal threat to our nation. his usage of that term clearly makes his opinion invalid as well
Elements aficionados come with papers, filters, and the pack folds out into a rolling tray.
happy 4/20 y'all 
I was expecting like 2-3 people under the parachute, not a whole crowd! LULZ at the tour group watching this go down.
What a bunch of fucktards. Especially the idiots filming this. 
I remember watching this 'stealthily' in a high school computer lab 7+ years ago.
Actually, I think he's on to something. He seems to have earned an extra amount of marginal karma after posting the same comment twice. Interesting...
Hahaha I made that comment so long ago, didn't check Reddit and just realized it posted twice. 

I'll delete the duplicate, with the lesser amount of karma of course
Holy shit the guy yelling is annoying as fuck.
Interesting, I needed the guy's commentary for it to be funny.  First time I watched it on mute, and it was exactly what I was expecting to happen.

Add guy who's inexplicably overjoyed by this event: comedy gold.
He's so fucking excited! Been anxiously waitiing for what seems forever by how into it he is!
It's not gold. 
Like a hyena and a baboon made offspring. I muted it and it became instantly more watchable. 
Reminds me of that Hyena guy in Batman Beyond. Or was he only in the Justice League one where they went to the future. Anyway, that guy. 
Hahahhhaha!
Then the video is boring as fuck lol. The guy commenting going crazy is what makes it funny?
Made it kind of funnier to me. 
Glad I turned off the volume a few seconds into the video.
Who doesnt like a good cackle tho?
I do, but that was too much for me.  That was just obnoxious.
I'm hate it when people loudly shout hahahaha. Ruins whatever amusement there might be, stamps all over it.
Honestly I found the guys laughing in the background to be more annoying. The classic stoner laugh where people just incessantly are half-laughing, half-giggling is super annoying, and seems to be a trait that's acquired through the subculture (much like "gay voice"). It's like they're doing it on purpose just to announce their participation in the culture to everyone. I have never heard a single stoner actually laugh like that. Some can get close, but it's always more of a chuckle if anything.

&gt;"Police were able to identify many of the people involved, and were able to make arrests for marijuana possession,” Davis said.

How's that even legal. Because you were in a parachute and someone may have had weed in it, you're guilty by association?
Bro they were hotboxing in there. If you were under there you were getting high, even if you "weren't trying" to get high you would have quickly known of the presence of weed and that would have made you aiding and abetting.
ahhahahaha listen the camera man! Mind of the stoner
Isnt weed legal there?  Or is this old? 
Old 
thanks
Old, plus it's still illegal to smoke in public.

"SCATTER!"
Hahaha theres like a whole classroom full of kids. I love how everyone just scatters. Too classic
For the love of god someone stabilize this!
You don't have to be the fastest stoner. Just faster than the slowest stoner. 
But what if they all run the exact same speed?  Then by being faster than the slowest one, you're faster than all of them.  So in that case you ARE the fastest as well as being faster than the slowest.
this is old and its at my university in south Colorado. 
Maybe give the camera to the guy who *doesn't* have Parkinson's.
Back in my day, we used the antenna on a cell phone
Like the plastic bit? Oh mon.
He means you keep it in there while you're smoking. 

Unless you actually smoked *through* your cell phone, in which case, cool.
Holy camerashake batman! This cinematographer is jonesin' bad!
Borderline unwatchable, total stooge idiot filming.
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPOSTTTTTTTTTT
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!
I love how this post surfaces every 4/10. It kills me every time! The cop running in circles, and the cameraman's reaction. This video is what made me interested to find out what 4/20 was.

Filmed by Michael j fox
"Paul Blick, also in his first year at FLC, said one student known as a hippie who regularly participated in drum circles, for some reason had a parachute"

lol
Man, Michael J. Fox really needs to work on his camera skills.
This needs to be top comment.
Scramble scramble one shouted
repost, same time every year.
Yep, once again. Can't believe people still updoot that shit.
Cause it's a classic, at this point.
This is a really old video, but hilarious that it's getting upvoted again on the perfect time for it :)
Why has no one posted a pic of Xzibit yet!? And yes, I could do it now instead of typing this, but I just won't.
I went to FLC. Remember seeing this video at least a decade ago, probably earlier.
may be that's because it is the minimum number of people required to refer them as stoner_s_
Me too. I figured if it was any more than that, *someone* in the group would realize a parachute isn't an invisibility cloak.
older than the internet 
Do you know how hard it is to get that many stoners to coordinate something? Damn near impossible.

... Well, unless weed is involved, of course.
Why would you announce it an entire year early?  

Is "the slowest stoner" an autobiography then?
:''''''(((((
Love u
no u
The reaction is almost as good as the video 
It's called a tip in Germany, albeit there are some people who also smoke with [these filters](http://i.imgur.com/JUCsp6a.jpg).
We live in a "free" country, but we have to all run in a panic if you enjoy yourself in a way not approved of by the rulers. 
SCATTER!
After reading that, I'm like *I had taken in too much weed today?*
And then the guy with the dry lips pulls it out inevitably within its first go around. 
Hahahaaha
JFC that video gave me motion sickness

Going to barf now
Awesome to see Fort Lewis (DHS part deux) getting some love.  I bet it was hard to run far at that altitude, with lungs full of kush.
That would be called a crutch, my esteemed friend
I've only heard "crutch" in the past two years. It's always been filter for my region. I've never heard a crutch or filter called a roach before though... That was always the little endbit that everyone's too scared to smoke because it burns the hell out of your lips/fingers/whatever. 
This clip is older than reddit.
Was this during an earth quake? Or is that just Michael J. Fox holding the camera? 
I almost didn't up vote this video, based solely on how terrible the camera was shaking.

But it was funny, so I did.
it wasn't that funny.
I love living in Seattle.
Was hoping there would be a massive plume of smoke. Disappointed.
Hello fellow Durangatang!
&gt;Schield, wearing heels, ran behind a bush, composed herself and started walking back to her room as if nothing had happened.

&gt;Now a vice president of an insurance agency that specializes in insuring cannabis grow shops’ products, Schield said she laughs every time she watches the video.
You could say it all went up in smoke for the officer.
For some reason I thought it was boulder. Oh well I guess I got the state right and in 2007 the quad was probably packed with stoners in boulder anyway 
&gt; Regardless, Spigarelli said the Stoner Dash remains one of the most memorable college experiences. And he was even able to make a friend out of it.

&gt; “I ended up being friends with some of the people who were on that tour group,” he said. “They’d say that’s the whole reason they came here.”

Heh. 
Towards the end the guy filming sounded like a over excited monkey.
Thanks for the info from the description portion of the video.
You realize you can watch the video from this page without seeing the youtube comments, right?
Maybe some people can.
Also keeps the tip from getting all gunked up and unsmokable
the slowest stoner is like the fastest cheetah. 
the best at what he does?
Nah, they're both just really fucking hungry.
i guess if it's chester the cheetah. that mothafucker is high all day behind those shades scarfin down cheetos
I just googled his name,  holy shit haha he's definitely a stoner
Giggling stoner films stoners 'avin' a giggle

Jesus this video never gets old man.  Hilarious
find out what this means for *YOUR* weekend
I love how the campus cop chases the guy that came out last.
To be fair, today we listened to stoners watching stoners getting caught smoking under a parachute, while also watching them
This just made me really miss high school.

It filters the resin. Did you not read my OP?
no. it doesn't 

its a piece of cardboard. not a filter.

This is incredibly common just not with casual or newbie smokers. College has a large portion of people who's only previous experience with weed was maybe senior week. If you'd been smoking for a long time you were probably just ahead of the curve. 
This is mad! There are some people who smoke a j *without* a roach/cut/peice of card?

I think I just had a seizure 
Reading the comments has reaffirmed my belief that just about everyone smokes bud.
E&amp;S NATION 
I see this every 420 and every 420 I have to add that this was at my college  many many years ago. The campus police were cock suckers. They pulled a gun on my buddy while he was hitting a bong under the stoner tree. Which is also not the easiest place to get to.
These kids had a great highdea
A bunch of them got busted after they left their phones under the tent. The risk was probably worth it.
ITT: A bunch of dumbasses who don't realize that his camera is zoomed to the max, and therefore is much more sensitive to the natural shaking of the hand.
No Stoners get caught smoking pot under a parachute*
Calm down there ape stoner. AAAH HA AAAAAAAAAAAAA  Loud enough? Overly dramatic laughing. We get it you thought it was intensely funny. Stupid.
Reminds me of [this](http://youtu.be/BIvIEF19nm0).
Is that Michael J. Fox working the camera?
Best part is the guy who stuck around to get his stuff
I'm not gunna lie.  I was really hoping to see this big cloud of smoke rush out when then opened the parachute to run
Oh god I think that's my campus
Will a medic do?
The classic 4/20 post, I will never not upvote those blazed af laughs.
For a moment, the dude sounded just like a monkey. Like shit we aren't genetically related 
Dang that's dumb.
So nice of Michael J. Fox to provide us with this footage.
Oldie but goodie, haven't seen this video in a few years.
Alumni checking in. I'm moving back to Durango someday for sure.
I love watching this video every year 😂 The guys laugh is better than the rest of the video. 
As other people said there's a few names for it. Head shops even sell glass ones. Its to prevent it from being wasteful. I dont smoke joints anymore cause im of age and can afford better means but anyone in high school that didnt roll with a crutch was either shit at rolling (adds stability so you can flick it like a cig) or they just didn't know they were wasting their stuff. A roach or crutch also makes it so you can tighten at the base as you roll giving you joints that looked factory made. Cap it with a French hat and you'd have the best joint possible to roll by hand. Looks way better than machine rolled in my opinion. 
Yes, i pictured exactly 2 inside too.

One thing I never got about smoking weed. You can smell that stuff a block away. A whole dorm floor would reek of it. It was pretty easy for the RA or a cop on a beat to figure out where it was coming from. Pretty much needed to be in a private house or do it late at night. (this was early 90s)

But smoke in the middle of the day on a quad?
I don't know if you smoked much weed in a dorm, but there is a SOP that can be used to minimize the risk. 

1) keep your weed in an air tight jar to contain the smell. 
2) put an exhaust fan in your window that pulls air out of your room and use it anytime you plan to make an odor. 
3) only smoke, open your weed jar, or do any other smelly activities close enough to the exhaust fan so the smell doesn't permeate into the dorm hallway or your room. 
4) create a sploof of to exhale your weed smoke through. I'm sure different people have different names for this device, but they should all serve the same function. I used an empty 1 liter Pepsi bottle stuffed with dryer sheets, and poke small holes in the bottom. By exhaling your smoke through this device, it will no longer smell like weed.
5) not everyone will agree with this, but I recommend smoking using a one hitter. By only packing one hit, you can smoke all the weed at once and contain all the smoke. A couple one hitters of dank nug is all I ever needed. When smoking a bowl or joint, there will be smoke that smolders from the bowl/joint, and it's much harder to contain the smell and smoke.
6) Last but not least, ensure that your exhaust fan isn't exhausting straight into someone else's window/area. 

If you want to smoke in total peace just go for a hike somewhere. There may be other good tips like a towel under the door, but this procedure, if followed strictly, should keep you safe. I smoked stanky ass dank nuggets in the dorm for two years using this method and never got noticed by an RA or cop. 
SOP - hilarious.

Ah, those where the days. Maybe it was the quad where most of the dorms where at my college. But you knew when somebody was smoking.

My favorite was when dudes where in dorms that had positive pressure in the rooms and negative pressure in the halls. Didn't matter what they did. We never got confirmation, but we suspected the dorm was designed that way.
say what you want, that get away was clean!
Hey I go to this school.
/r/FakeNames 
Probably either the piece or the weed
interesting priorities. cops chasing him and hes like "shit forgot my bowl" and runs back to get it. I think I would leave it on purpose.  
Maybe a phone with info that encriminated him and others, actually probably more likely. 
I was never that logical and rational when I was high. 
I would definitely have been paranoid enough though lol
Nah, student ID I bet.
it was his phone
Charlie doesn't have many places to hide in his apartment.
Hold the camera steady, ffs.
This is so old my grandmother has seen it... being said... still one of my favorite videos on the Internet.
That's my friend's parachute, this would have been spring of '07 
With my luck I would've been the guy to get chased 
They won't have that problem this year.
That kinda ruined the clip for me, really. It's not that difficult to hold it *just* a bit steadier.
He needed a joint.
Fakeee
Also, everyone must have been shaken by the long earthquake that was happening. 
Yeah from where i'm from, we call it a Royale with cheese.
This has to be damn near 10 years old. Front page...smh. 

HEY HAVE YOH GUYS SEEN THIS STAR WARS KID? He's wacky!
r/contagiouslaughter
Is that like when you kill someone, and then everyone around starts killin' people too?
Worst portmanteau ever.
Amazing they could still film during that earthquake
There were way, WAY more people that came running out of that thing than I expected.  Like, I expected half a dozen or something. They were really packed in there.
some people call em crutches. doesn't filter shit.
..Stoners are cockroaches now? That's quite an attitude shift there, Reddit. 
No, but have you ever seen roaches scamper when the light gets turned on? That's what this looked like. I wasn't being literal, hence the word "like"

Also, they probably dropped a few roaches in the process, so what I said had a double affect if you were paying attention.
But a) you didn't use the word "like," and b) you said "cockroaches," not "roaches."
You're right, sorry dealing with midterms so I'm not paying attention to post I make on reddit.
Whoa, when does your school year end?
It's a quarter system. I'm in the second quarter for this year.
I am so sorry to hear the camera guy has early onset parkinsons.
That was like popping a spiders nest.  
Was there a fucking earthquake going on?
Ya, no one deserves that to happen to them while recording a 1st generation potatoe
I figured it was a smoke circle, like everyone holding down the edges.

The scramble while the cop waits... then chases after the last guy.

You only have to be faster than the other guy.
The cops need something better to do than bust people for having a good time. I smoke cigarettes and they are far deadlier than pot ever will be. This kind of shit annoys the crap out of me.

No, I can't smoke pot. Makes things...a bit nuts for me so I stay away. But they might as well bust me for smoking a cigarette.
But wouldn't the earthquake and the seizure cancel out, so that the camera remains steady?
Sith always come in pairs. 
/r/infectiouslaughter
It would be physically impossible to hold ~~tge~~ the parachute down ~~eith~~ with just 2 people. 

Edit:  It would be impossible, over very difficult, to hold it down *in that fashion*, keeping it in a nice dome shape.  Air would escape from the parts not held down, or wind would blow under it.
If that were true, a parachute with just one person attached to it would never fall back to Earth, which would kind of defeat the purpose of a parachute.
Allow me to clarify:  It would be impossible, over very difficult, to hold it down *in that fashion*, keeping it in a nice dome shape. Air would escape from the parts not held down, or wind would blow under it.
I know, I was just being a smartass.
Sounds like the type of attention seeking ''laugh'' people make when they want every one in the vicinity to know they find something funny.
Seems to be non-american thing. Roaches are pointless, why not just smoke the whole joint with a filter?
If you smoke the whole joint with a filter you're gonna filter out some of the weed as well.

Smoking without a roach you'll end up not smoking all of the weed since the very bottom will either burn your lips or just crumble to pieces,


Coming from a place where weed was 20€/g or more it made sense not to be wasteful.
You're not going to filter out weed with a folded piece of cardboard 
Fantastic case of two people speaking nearly the same language completely misunderstanding each other.
Roach /= filter

Roach is that folded piece of cardboard (at least in europe)
I understand if you put a filter tip in with hash.

Weed you're just wastin it.
Not cool that someone put this on YT the popo can use it as evidence.
Filmed by Michael J. Fox
This guy sounds like what i imagine the chimpanzee that ripped that woman's face off sounded like during the act.
It's 2016...why is this guy still using a razor flip phone to record?
it doesn't look like anyone was actually caught.
Am I the only one that would just remain lying in the parachute while everyone else ran? Once they all left I could gather the left over weed. Sure I have a chance of being seen. But high risk very high reward.
High. Reward.

Skyhawk '00 grad here! Palmer-Escalante represent!
This dude I know rolls with cigarette filters. Changes nothing. and is a nice little holder.
Logically some of the THC/cannabinoids would get caught in the filter, right?
Yes, using an *actual* filter for joints is not ideal for getting everything you want out of it
Naturally some, but not enough to make any difference in high or taste. 

Aight, I've never tried it myself. I just remember the difference in smoking tobacco with or without a filter as being quite big (one would have me almost puking because of the amount of nicotine).
For some reason that reminds me of the time I got stoned in the upstairs closet, my parents came home and I figured I just stay there and they wouldn't find me. They followed the weed smell and opened the closet door, I ran out only in underwear, climbed out my bedroom window, jumped off the roof and ran into the neighborhood. 
He went back for his bong, no bong left behind! 
It sounded like the laughing man was having his leg sawed off while filming haha.  Just insane laughter.
[deleted]
How long? What did you get caught with? What state?
That laugh was horrendous 
I too expected 2. 
Which turns out to be one of the funniest sounds i've ever heard.
And the poor slow kid gets caught.
4-20 never forget
That guys laugh is the laugh of someone who has either had too many brownies or is plotting to kill the Batman. 
get out of the stoned age man filter your damn joints
"For some reason"... like... just being hotboxed under a parachute? lol
I am a stoner can confirm stoner 
[deleted]
First, it wasn't a felony here in Colorado. If you got caught with weed/smoking weed you might get a $100 ticket. Second, these are college students getting high on the quad, not potential gang members, so I don't think they were particularly worried about weapons.
With all of them smoking in such close proximity they must have gotten so fucked up. I hope this was in Denver.
Couldn't love that more!! I just picture everyone just laughing their heads off running
Hold fucking still!

He looks to be trying to take the parachute with him. Maybe it's his?
He went from huehuehue to WAAAAHAHAHAHA.

I hope the guy recovered from the stroke though.
Does anyone know where this video took place. It looks a lot like the CU Boulder campus or at least Boulder 
Good god that camera man and his stupid friends are Harry and Lloyd. They Blair Witch'd the shit out of this video!
I want to go to there

But I'm stuck here doing accounting
Probably because stoners come in pairs.

Do people still smoke twice as much at 8:40pm? I used to be all about that back when I used to smoke
they ran. they actually RAN. that in itself deserves respect.

I thought he must have been jerking off or something.
Why do these fucking idiots have to scream while holding the camera.

Damn next time let someone else hold the camera
Same I was expecting like a huge cloud of smoke to come out and like 2 guys using it as like a smoke bomb to escape
camera stoner needs to stop smoking because he is developing parkinson.
When I saw this I was like, "This video is like, 10 years old?" Damn I was 1 year off
Should've had at least 20 cops and a chopper overhead.
Michael J Fox on the camera...
It looked like he grabbed something.
im saddened, this video is from 2007 so the videographer must have surely died from Parkinson's disease by now if the symptoms were that severe in 2007.
It doesn't help when the camera man is a talking chimpanzee.
and a whole lotta smoke
And then they vanished in a puff of smoke. 
Motion sickniss alert!
Said he dropped his phone
Worst. cameraman. ever.

I didn't know Michael J Fox was still making movies?
What do you mean? It gets all greyish blue after they start running away. Keep in mind it was an open space. That's a lot of smoke
Greetings from Durango!
I thought only the ones inside parachute got caught
This is old as shit
I've seen Jihadi videos shot better than this....
No stoners caught while stoners caught watching stoners avoid getting caught while smoking under a parachute.
/u/paidtheplug lmao
Chasing skinny kids is above my pay grade.
The school I went to had real cops with a station on campus. If you had nerf or squirt guns you had to take them to their vault. They were dicks and didn't fuck around. Not sure if this guy is real or not. 
See that would definitely be me, the trick is to give any shit you have to the fastest people, that way if the slow people get caught they won't have anything incriminating on them.
I love how ineffective the copper was at doing anything about it. I'll chase you... eh nah. I'll chase that guy, he's waiting around a bit... Eh no point
I miss college ... 
This is a true classic video, older yet still entertaining. Great post, brought back the younger memories! 
I'm really glad the only person with a camera was the patient at the Parkinsons clinic
Video is only 9 years old.
It's like when a pregnant spider gets stepped on.

Lets be blunt, those kids smoked him before he even could even bend a joint.
I bet it shattered his ego, and caused him some reefer madness.
This is at my Alma mater! Fort Lewis in Durango, CO. one of my roommates was inside the parachute.
I swear to god I thought that guy was going to explode he was laughing so hard
Yeah I didn't know if he was or not... but he couldn't hold the camera straight and the second he started laughing I knew for sure
That one guy that he caught must be very sad.

Classic proof for:  "I don't have to run faster than the ~~bear~~ pig.   I just have to run faster than *you*".
It's a class C misdemeanor. He will probably sit in jail for less than a week. If those people are actually his friends, then he will probably be given plenty compensation for taking the fall.
hey tthats me! [6[
Wow is that camera work top notch, only puked twice while watching
STOP SHAKING THE CAMERA
You don't have to be faster than the cops, just faster than your friends !!!
How can he film so steadily during an earthquake?

Wow, haven't seen this video in 10 years...
Funny clip but fuck that Adderall-addicted shaky azz camera man

Ooold
That kid does not know how to hold a camera
We definitely came from apes. 
Or you know, you could use textbooks. It's not like stoners have much use for their textbooks anyway
I beg to differ. I have a couple of stoner friends. They're the some of the smartest kids I know, do all their work, study, go to class, but they just do it high as fuck. And they maintain a 3.5+ GPA. Not all stoners are lazy. 
I always see that 3.5+ GPA is the dogs bollocks, but what does that equate to? By Percentage? 

Edit: bullocks to bollocks. I don't actually know what bullocks are. 
3.5 would be if half your class grades were A's and half B's.
High b, so an a/b mix. So around 88-92%? Idk the actual percentage, but it's relatively good. 
Like 85-92% depending on the grading system
Can confirm, living proof. I am excellent at Math, well, anything number related while high. I smoked a quarter a week in college and carried a 3.6 GPA.

GPA could have been higher too if I didn't have to commute an hour both ways daily to attend class, and I never missed a day I could help. So I don't think I'm lazy...

Where's his pepper spray?
Nah man that was Beavis and Butthead
You think it's a cop, but really it's just that asshole that nobody wanted to invite but somehow found out about it anyways.
Ted - "Guys I know you are in there. C'mon let me in."
Stoner 1 - "Oh shit it's Ted who told him? Fuck! Everyone just be quite, maybe he will go away. *uncontrollable coughing*"
Ted - "C'mon guys just let me hit it. I can throw in."
Stoner 2 - "Fuck man he isn't going away. What are we going to do?"
Stoner 1 - "I've got it! Shotgun and run on three. Everybody ready?"
Other Stoners - " Yeah man, wait what are we doing again?"
Stoner 1 - "Running from Ted!"
Other Stoners - "Oh yeah, right, cool."
Stoner 1 - "Okay, 1, 2..."
Stoner 3 - "Man, any of you guys ever looked at the back of a twenty dollar bill man, it's really trippy."
Stoner 1 - "No man I think I have a 5 though"
Ted - "C'mon guys, let me in or i'm telling"
Stoner 4 - " Oh shit, I think it's Ted everybody run!!"

What have you used for stabilizing it /u/thethotbot ?
I'm using Blender but it's a bit heavy for small jobs like this one.
I used Adobe Premier's Warp Stabilizer plugin, then I let YouTube stabilize it a second time. :)
I was there when this happened, I'm actually watching form the doorway of crofton hall, right behind the parachute.

A few little known facts about the events of that day:

It was a visitation day, meaning there was a massive group of high school kids touring the campus with their parents. There was actually a large group of them on the walkway directly below the building where this video was taken. I think the tour was cancelled after this.

One of the guys under the parachute left behind his digital camera in the chaos, and the police made a bunch of arrests based on pictures that were found on it.
If I had gold, I'd give it to you. For now all I have is this "IOU"

The funniest thing to me were the hyaenas were filming this.
Why... jesus
This video is about as old as those giant parachutes.
My buddy was in there! He showed me the video years ago and then it got picked up on one of those Tru TV clip shows..
Sounded like a couple of down syndrome kids filming. 
Someone please explain what combo of craziness is going on in this vine. First, how did a bunch of pubes turn into spiders. Second, why were spiders clumping together like that. And finally, what does that dope theme song translate to? 
VOLUME WARNING
That's amazing
I did not want to see that. .

Boo,  you whore!
You're doing God's work son.
/r/nope
Best laugh of 420 so far!
still one of the greatest vids on the internet
For an orangutan, he held that camera pretty darn steady!
Now do something about that screeching laughter.
Wtf is that guy getting butt fucked in the video
Now if someone would just remove the annoying people talking. 
You're talking about the Mute button.
Heh.   Yeah I know,  that's what I had to do. 
Me too, I can't remember the last time I heard laughter as annoying as this
I want to smack that cameraman so badly. Steady hands!!
I was thinking spider egg sac.
Cameraman: Michael J. Fox
Can you tell Nobody I said what's up? Haven't talked to that dude since he had to deal with some cyclops or something.
That laugh though..
I watched it for 20 seconds and figured someone would do it or mention it and ctrl+f'd stab.

Am not disappoint
I just like how the cop seems to give up on arresting anyone when he notices how many there are in the beginning and then he's like " Fuck I gotta arrest someone."
That was a pretty......dope getaway. 
This video brought to you by Michael j Fox
I don't think I've ever heard anyone have that good of a time watching something. Holy moley. Laugh with abandon.
Earthquake or Parkinson's?
No shit. this is college-level.  You gotta work hard to get to this point. 
What kind of backwards elementary school did you go to? 
Dutch one.
one of them "Zero Tolerance" schools I bet~
Good old Fort Lewis
Fucking hippies. And that laugh is awful.
Am I too young or something? Because I don't remember this thing at all. 
Gotta love when ebaums content surfaces on reddit
I like how everyone ignores the person holding the camera who is in obvious need of medical attention for his seizure.
Thank you. I'm worried for him too. My guess was a seizure or Parkinson's.
Were you there? I think this is one of the whole planet's highlights. This video makes me miss college almost enough to go back at 27. 
I was!
Try to catch all hundred of our asses!
An oldie but a classic.
Thank god camera's got image stabilization.
Fort lewis College, Durango Colorado. My brother didn't participate but saw this from his dorm.
Of course the lazy cop goes after the slowest fat kid.
the guys laugh is disturbing 
*Stoners record stoners getting caught smoking under a parachute.
