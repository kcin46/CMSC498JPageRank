Lol the campus cop half-heartedly chasing the slowest stoner
&gt;the slowest stoner


a new heartwarming uplifting childrens book coming next 4-20 to a headshop near you
And its sequel "The Little Stoner that Couldn't".
"and didn't even try"
I cannot stop laughing at this for some reason.
is it because you're an underachieving stoner who doesn't try? :D
Smoked daily for half my life, until recently. Now I'm just an underachieving person who doesn't try. So yeah, basically 
that slowest stoner was me. i outran him, barefoot.

photo of me circa 2007 under that parachute on a different day/photo of me now
http://imgur.com/a/Kgysy
You delivered, fucking A1 

Also, why did you go back? 
was holding a bowl and my phone in the same hand. dropped them both. went back for the phone (incriminating evidence), came up eye to eye with the officer, executed a ? pattern on foot. lost my shoes. didn't stop.
Did you get your birkenstocks back?
no :(
So you grow your own now? Colorado?
i'm general manager of grow operations for a colorado dispensary :)
Did he never see you again or he just never bother to do anything with you if he ever saw you again? 
he came to my dorm room the next week looking for my roommate and didn't recognize me. i had long hair at the time and when this all went down it was up, when he came by later it was down. needless to say i still almost had a heart attack when i looked through the peephole at him standing outside my door.
Damn You lucked out then, I would be panicking like crazy. Do you know what happened afterwards, anyone get in trouble? 
2 girls got popped from a photo on a camera left behind. they just had to do some community service. 
You're a monster
he was actually pretty early out, but for unknown reason runs back. Maybe he was gonna get something or figured he could hide under the parachute, which I'm certain someone did
definitely went back and grabbed something off the ground. 
the actual dude appeared in the above comments (provided photos for proof) and said he dropped his phone, so he had to return to grab it
For some reason that reminds me of the time a friend and I were baked and we're twirling around the yard singing a whole new world, some dude came walking down the alley so we dropped and figured if we just lie down as flat as we could he wouldn't notice us. 
 "I'm thinking if I get into bed and I get real low and flat and then you're underneath me or on top of me, you know, they won't see us."

"What—how—how does that work?"

"OK, well, see, here's the problem. If I get all balled up and small, I get too high, and you'll see that there's someone in the bed. Now the further and wider I go"

"Uh-huh."

"The flatter I become, like a starfish, you know?"

"But what in the hell are you talking about? Why would we wanna look like a starfish?"
maybe it was his parachute and he tried to take it with him
He's asking himself "Where's the damn fat one?"
Honestly if he's like most campus cops I knew they weren't really into busting kids for smoking. Distributing, sure, but if you got caught smoking and there wasn't a camera they'd throw it out and warn you. He is, after all, basically their employee. 

I'd suspect his primary goal of moving them away from the tour group (and parents) and secondary goal of scaring the shit out of them was accomplished perfectly.
It's like a fucking clown car! I didn't expect there to be that many underneath it.
I was picturing just two inside, for some reason.
I expected a circle just about, like 8 or 10 or so. And I've watched this shit before too, damn my memory is shit. 
Ya know, I've heard that smoking marijuanas can cause short term memory loss and even short term memory loss. 
You can tell how it is because how it is
How neat is that?
They don't think it be like it is, but it do.
That's pretty neat
I think you've been spending too much time under the parachute.
I was just surprised there wasn't a bigger cloud that escaped with them... 
That's honestly what I expected to be so amusing about the video. Generally a let down though. 
And then the cop sees the *one dude* who *miiiiight* not outrun him, so he starts lumbering haphazardly in that direction. 
Hey, the cop was making a token effort. 
I did. Seeing videos like this taught me well.

Stoners get caught watching stoners get caught smoking under a parachute...

But first, sports with Justin Blaze.
'the Nuggets played the Blazers last night, nobody remembers a god damn thing'
Wow. Our Denver basketball team now makes more sense in reference to cannabis nuggets, than to gold nuggets.
And our Blazers! Holy shit, basketball team names may just be influencing public policy regarding the legalization of marijuana. Oh wait, I'm just high.
If Seattle gets a team back we'll have to conform and change to the Seattle SuperChronics
BREAKING NEWS: Nuggets tank because the playoffs interfere with 4/20
&gt; Nuggets

&gt; Playoffs
And after stopping at a gas station for snacks the GreenBowl Packers have all fallen asleep
Back to Mary Jane for a weather report
Clouds, back to you guys
BREAKING NEWS! Tommy lost his roach clip in the couch. So far all that has been found is 45 cents, a lighter with no fuel, and Gary's hamster that went missing a week ago. Our condolences to the fam of Gary's hamster. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Derrick's nug jar.

It's stoners all the way down 
Chimps film stoners getting caught smoking under a parachute.
I think the cameraman has the Reefer Madness.
Will someone call a doctor already! The cameraman is having a seizure. 
Probably just zoomed in so far that the smallest movements look like Romulans are firing on the camera man. 
I assumed it was filmed during a chimps tea party by the laughter...
Was it not?
That dudes laugh made this video. That and all the cockroaches that skattered! Hilarious. I totally didn't expect that many to run out. /r/Unexpected 
Stablized version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwgHkZ9pdxU&amp;feature=youtu.be
I like how the stabilized video just disappeared into a black hole while trying to stay still.
I think it's trying to escape the narrator's voice
That guy's hyena laughter makes me mad
"Fuck it, I don't get paid enough for this, I'M OUT"
Thank you. So much. I was getting angry watching the original. I can chill now.
tell me about it, i was getting unreasonably fucking pissed off
I kept my cool. I pictured Michael J Fox filming 
Thank goodness. The original was like watching a video taken by Michael J. Fox on moon shoes in an earthquake. Now it's like watching a video taken by Michael J. Fox on moon shoes in an earthquake while I'm tripping on LSD.
bless you
Police are bothering people who smoke weed, but the camera man had a stroke and nobody helped.
It must have been hard having a seizure while an earthquake hit.
Everything changed when the earhquake and seizure nation attacked. 
Sounded like a chimp having a fit.
He was hysterical lol
This was in 2007, in my home town.  Today's paper has [an article] (http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20160420/NEWS01/160429993/0/FRONTPAGE/Remembering-the-%E2%80%984/20-Parachute-Stoner-Dash%E2%80%99) with some "where are they now" and fun interviews

Wow. There seems to have been some success stories out of that parachute 
"Smith was ticketed and required to do community service. These days, she runs one of the largest marijuana companies in Colorado: Rocky Mountain High Dispensaries."   
  
No surprises here. 
"Now a vice president of an insurance agency that specializes in insuring cannabis grow shops’ products, Schield said she laughs every time she watches the video."
"Dan became addicted to heroin shortly after and died from overdose at the age of 24" Well shit.
I remember when this was first posted (myspace I think?), I was in high school and we tried to steal the parachute from the middle school to re-create this awesome idea.  I'm surprised that the top comments aren't about how long this video has been on the internet haha, it was extremely viral.
Wow. There seems to have been some success stories out of that parachute 
Dude 
wow there seems to have been some success stories out of that parachute

but for real, a primary source actually connected to the story? This should be much much higher, higher than me even.
this is a piece of stoner history right here﻿
You might say, it's a relic of the stoned age.
Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this.

Edit: Oh heck, I can't believe it's not butter.
[Obligatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X6VoFBCE9k)
Perfect timing, how about [Those points](http://i.imgur.com/kUaYszn.png)
Simply beautiful. Last winter, a campus officer caught a group of students doing the same thing in an igloo on my school's campus. Unfortunately, it isn't as easy to escape from an igloo as it is a parachute.

Edit: [Apparently it was two years ago.](http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/27/justice/utah-university-pot-igloo/) 
Wow they tore down the igloo too, that seems unnecessary.
It's Utah. The stoners are lucky they weren't stoned.
&gt; Apparently it was two years ago.

Bro, these stoners were in a [Quinzhee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinzhee), not an igloo!
And it happened at my local college! This Fort Lewis College located in Durango, CO. Its a legend on campus.
I saw this video almost a decade ago.  Probably one of the best reposts of the year, its been a while.
they scattered like roaches
except the one idiot at the end who went back to presumably get his stuff, and was probably the one guy to get arrested. 
Makes sense if it was his wallet with ID...
Or his weed
Report it stolen
report it stolen 
You can see the cop makes a second appearance near the end, empty handed. Idiot got away! 
A happy ending.
heh roaches... it's funny because that's what you call the unsmoked remnant of joints.
Huh, we always used the name roach for the filter where im from.
You smoke joints with a filter?...

Edit: guess I was misunderstood. I've always referred to them as crutches like you guys are. I was under the impression everyone was loading their joints with a cigarette filter or some shit.
Nah you fold a little bit of cardboard or something and it holds the end open and provides a bit of space between the weed and your mouth.
That is called a crutch in my area.
Crutch, filter, roach, are all acceptable. 
We called it a splint.  Yours are better though, I think.
we call it a tip.
We call it a Fleepborapong, well I call it that. 
In Britain they call it the jointy pointy, in Germany they call it the Weederrollenholden, in Russia it calls you.
I've actually only heard people refer to the little stub you're left with at the end of a joint as the roach.  Crutch or no crutch.
In Québec we call it a "cut" as in "cut of cardboard/carton". 
Yeah, thats what we've always called a roach. Some king skins come with a pad of roach carboard attached for that reason. 
It's why I love Raw papers
I just rip off the cover part on my papers anyway
I use the little books of raw crutches
Fucking right, it keeps the resin off of your lips and let's you smoke it all without burning your fingers. 

Edit (clarification): cardboard filter. Not a cig filter. 
i know where i am from literally everyone uses a filter, or as it is commonly referred to here, a "crutch." 

We would just fold and roll up a piece of an index card. That way you can hold the J easier, and smoke it fully down to the end without an issue. It also usually smokes a lot easier and burns even throughout the whole thing.

When i got to college people were shocked to see this, so apparently it wasn't as common as i thought. 
It's like those baby spiders that ride on their mom's back and then scatter *everywhere*.
Yeah, reminded me of a spider being smashed into lots of baby spiders too. Like this

To anyone else who might be tempted to click that:

It's ~~exactly what it sounds like~~ worse than it sounds, steer clear!
Time to set the house on fire
Holy shit smoke some weed camera man to calm those shakes.
Unfortunate that nothing can be done about his screeching laugh...
I don't usually put my headset in. You win some you lose some. Guess I won this one.
you call _that_ winning??
He didn't put his headset in, so yeah, I'd say he won.
I thought it was funny.
Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado for those interested. What a proud relic for my alma mater.
Yeah. That's right next to my old dorm building. I wonder what year this is. I'm thinking it's like ten years ago, or more.
i think i saw it first about 10 years ago.
Uploaded in 2007, so ya pretty much.
It's way older than that though.  I remember seeing this video on Ebaums world.
[Ebaums World](http://t1.livememe.com/mxqvia_4.jpg)?
Fort Lewis:  It's sort of like college.
It's got many nick names. Fort Leisure, Fort Lewis High, Snort Lewis. What a school.
&gt; Durango, Colorado

~~so, why would they get arrested? Isn't it legal there?~~

&gt; Uploaded on Apr 22, ***2007***

&gt;Festivities at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado.

oh, guess that's why.
1. This video is oooooold

2. Marijuana use is legal only by 21+ and only in private residences
You're telling me that a makeshift parachute home isn't private residence anymore. What is the world coming to.
This is my own private domicile.
and I will not be harassed.... BITCH
Not in public first of all, just like alcohol, and not 10 years ago. 
Cause the video is old. 
Cheers fellow Skyhawk!
There are dozens of us!
We are the dozen that actually graduated.
Fort leisure represent! 
Hey I am a proud Fort Lewis adventure education dropout and I demand the respect that entails!
I was there in '04!  Cooper hall represent!  
Currently enrolled. The cops turn the sprinklers on now just before 4:20 pm
Someone needs to stabilize this video.  Watching it was torturous.  

I still watched it though. . . 
Done  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwgHkZ9pdxU
I don't know what you're talking about,

Video ^fineTHE

Was

I expected it to be two stoners under a parachute
Takes more than two people to hold down the edges and make a decent air seal. They must have been hotboxed as fuck in that thing.
From this distance that cop looks like Lahey. 

I hope at least some of those runners yelled "frig off" as they got away.
The shithawks were circling.
Its funny how old "viral" videos give me a nice feeling of nostalgia now 
Yeah it's long enough ago that it's not 'oh this again', but rather 'oh wow it's been so long!'

I still make sure to watch bootleg fireworks at least once a month though.

EDIT: How did I miss the date...
We never did this with the parachute in kindergarten.
One of the highlights of my life
I feel like they missed a great opportunity there to wrap the officer in the parachute.
